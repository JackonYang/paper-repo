We show that we can estimate the coarse geometric properties of a scene by learning appearance-based models of geometric classes, even in cluttered natural scenes. Geometric classes describe the 3D orientation of an image region with respect to the camera. We provide a multiple-hypothesis framework for robustly estimating scene structure from a single image and obtaining confidences for each geometric label. These confidences can then be used to improve the performance of many other applications. We provide a thorough quantitative evaluation of our algorithm on a set of outdoor images and demonstrate its usefulness in two applications: object detection and automatic single-view reconstruction."

The interpretation of shading, edges, and junctions may provide a 3D model of the scene but it will not provide information about the actual \"scale\" of the space. One possible source of information for absolute depth estimation is the image size of known objects. However, object recognition, under unconstrained conditions, remains difficult and unreliable for current computational approaches. We propose a source of information for absolute depth estimation based on the whole scene structure that does not rely on specific objects. We demonstrate that, by recognizing the properties of the structures present in the image, we can infer the scale of the scene and, therefore, its absolute mean depth. We illustrate the interest in computing the mean depth of the scene with application to scene recognition and object detection."

The main premise of the approach is the fact that in man-made environments, the majority of lines is aligned with the principal orthogonal directions of the world coordinate frame. We exploit this observation towards efficient detection and estimation of vanishing points, which provide strong constraints on camera parameters and relative orientation of the camera with respect to the scene.By combining efficient image processing techniques in the line detection and initialization stage we demonstrate that simultaneous grouping and estimation of vanishing directions can be achieved in the absence of internal parameters of the camera. Constraints between vanishing points are then used for partial calibration and relative rotation estimation. The algorithm has been tested in a variety of indoors and outdoors scenes and its efficiency and automation makes it amenable for implementation on robotic platforms."

The approach works by using projective invariants to determine all the possible projectively equivalent models for a particular imaged object; then a system of global consistency constraints is used to determine which of these projectively equivalent, but Euclidean distinct, models corresponds to the objects viewed. These constraints follow from properties of the imaging geometry. In particular, a recognition hypothesis is equivalent to an assertion about, among other things, viewing conditions and geometric relationships between objects, and these assertions must be consistent for hypotheses to be correct.

Support for this idea comes from three sources: the obvious utility of intrinsic characteristics for higher-level scene analysis; the apparent ability of humans to determine these characteristics, regardless of viewing conditions or familiarity with the scene; and a theoretical argument that such a description is obtainable, by a noncognitive and nonpurposive process, at least, for simple scene domains. The central problem in recovering intrinsic scene characteristics is that the information is confounded in the original light-intensity image: a single intensity value encodes all the characteristics of the corresponding scene point. Recovery depends on exploiting constraints, derived from assumptions about the nature of the scene and the physics of the imaging process."

The model is based on a set of parts which describe the expected appearance and position, in an object centered coordinate frame, of features detected by a low-level interest operator. Each object category then has its own distribution over these parts, which are shared between objects. We learn the parameters of this model via a Gibbs sampler which uses the graphical model's structure to analytically average over many parameters. Applied to a database of images of isolated objects, the sharing of parts among objects improves detection accuracy when few training examples are available. We also extend this hierarchical framework to scenes containing multiple objects"

We construct a Bayesian model that implements this assumption and estimates the viewer orientation relative to the Manhattan grid. For many images, these estimates are good approximations to the viewer orientation (as estimated manually by the authors). These estimates also make it easy to detect outlier structures that are unaligned to the grid. To determine the applicability of the Manhattan world model, we implement a null hypothesis model that assumes that the image statistics are independent of any three-dimensional scene structure. We then use the log-likelihood ratio test to determine whether an image satisfies the Manhattan world assumption. Our results show that if an image is estimated to be Manhattan, then the Bayesian model's estimates of viewer direction are almost always accurate (according to our manual estimates), and vice versa."

Unfortunately, calibration information is rarely available and difficult to obtain after a surveillance system has been installed. In this paper, a method for camera autocalibration based on information gathered by tracking people is developed. It brings two main contributions: first, we show how a foot-to-head plane homology can be used to obtain the calibration parameters and then we show an approach how to efficiently estimate initial parameter estimates from measurements; second, we present a Bayesian solution to the calibration problem that can elegantly handle measurement uncertainties, outliers, as well as prior information. It is shown how the full posterior distribution of calibration parameters given the measurements can be estimated, which allows making statements about the accuracy of both the calibration parameters and the measurements involving them"

However the issue of how to formalize centextual influences is still largely open. Here we introduce a simple probabilistic framework for modeling the relationship between context and object properties. We represent global context information in terms of the spatial layout of spectral components. The resulting scheme serves as an effective procedure for context driven focus of attention and scale-selection on real-world scenes. Based on a simple holistic analysis of an image, the scheme is able to accurately predict object locations and sizes."

We quantify the contents of the dataset and compare against existing state of the art datasets used for object recognition and detection.

The discriminative random fields offer several advantages over the conventional Markov random field (MRF) framework. First, the DRFs allow to relax the strong assumption of conditional independence of the observed data generally used in the MRF framework for tractability. This assumption is too restrictive for a large number of applications in vision. Second, the DRFs derive their classification power by exploiting the probabilistic discriminative models instead of the generative models used in the MRF framework. Finally, all the parameters in the DRF model are estimated simultaneously from the training data unlike the MRF framework where likelihood parameters are usually learned separately from the field parameters. We illustrate the advantages of the DRFs over the MRF framework in an application of man-made structure detection in natural images taken from the Corel database."

Such characteristics make it possible to construct a powerful classifier by only representing the stronger direct dependencies among the variables. In particular, a Bayesian network compactly represents such structuring. However, learning the structure of a Bayesian network is known to be NP complete. The high dimensionality of images makes structure learning especially challenging. This paper describes an algorithm that searches for the structure of a Bayesian network based classifier in this large space of possible structures. The algorithm seeks to optimize two cost functions: a localized error in the log-likelihood ratio function to restrict the structure and a global classification error to choose the final structure of the network. The final network structure is restricted such that the search can take advantage of pre-computed estimates and evaluations. We use this method to automatically train detectors of frontal faces, eyes, and the iris of the human eye. In particular, the frontal face detector achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MIT-CMU test set for face detection."

Second, the formulation is general enough to be applied to different domains ranging from pixelwise image labeling to contextual object detection.

There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \u201cIntegral Image\u201d which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a simple and efficient classifier which is built using the AdaBoost learning algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1995) to select a small number of critical visual features from a very large set of potential features. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a \u201ccascade\u201d which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising face-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection is presented. The system yields face detection performance comparable to the best previous systems (Sung and Poggio, 1998; Rowley et al., 1998; Schneiderman and Kanade, 2000; Roth et al., 2000). Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second."

The parsing algorithm optimizes the posterior probability and outputs a scene representation as a \u201cparsing graph\u201d, in a spirit similar to parsing sentences in speech and natural language. The algorithm constructs the parsing graph and re-configures it dynamically using a set of moves, which are mostly reversible Markov chain jumps. This computational framework integrates two popular inference approaches\u2014generative (top-down) methods and discriminative (bottom-up) methods. The former formulates the posterior probability in terms of generative models for images defined by likelihood functions and priors. The latter computes discriminative probabilities based on a sequence (cascade) of bottom-up tests/filters. In our Markov chain algorithm design, the posterior probability, defined by the generative models, is the invariant (target) probability for the Markov chain, and the discriminative probabilities are used to construct proposal probabilities to drive the Markov chain. Intuitively, the bottom-up discriminative probabilities activate top-down generative models. In this paper, we focus on two types of visual patterns\u2014generic visual patterns, such as texture and shading, and object patterns including human faces and text. These types of patterns compete and cooperate to explain the image and so image parsing unifies image segmentation, object detection, and recognition (if we use generic visual patterns only then image parsing will correspond to image segmentation (Tu and Zhu, 2002. IEEE Trans. PAMI, 24(5):657\u2013673). We illustrate our algorithm on natural images of complex city scenes and show examples where image segmentation can be improved by allowing object specific knowledge to disambiguate low-level segmentation cues, and conversely where object detection can be improved by using generic visual patterns to explain away shadows and occlusions."

This paper illustrates how past work on a systematic engineering methodology for vision systems performance characterization can be used to develop a real-time people detection and zooming system to meet given application requirements. We illustrate that by judiciously choosing the system modules and performing a careful analysis of the influence of various tuning parameters on the system it is possible to: perform proper statistical inference, automatically set control parameters and quantify limits of a dual-camera real-time video surveillance system. The goal of the system is to continuously provide a high resolution zoomed-in image of a person's head at any location of the monitored area. An omni-directional camera video is processed to detect people and to precisely control a high resolution foveal camera, which has pan, tilt and zoom capabilities. The pan and tilt parameters of the foveal camera and its uncertainties are shown to be functions of the underlying geometry, lighting conditions, background color/contrast, relative position of the person with respect to both cameras as well as sensor noise and calibration errors. The uncertainty in the estimates is used to adaptively estimate the zoom parameter that guarantees with a user specified probability, /spl alpha/, that the detected person's face is contained and zoomed within the image."

It is inefficient to implement a lane detection algorithm through the full range of an image when it is applied to a real road in real time because of the calculation time. This paper defines two search ranges of detecting a lane in a road. First is the searching mode that searches the lane without any prior information of a road. Second is recognition mode, which is able to reduce the size and change the position of a searching range by predicting the position of a lane through the acquired information in a previous frame. It is allowed to extract accurately and efficiently the edge candidate points of a lane without any unnecessary searching. By means of inverse perspective transform that removes the perspective effect on the edge candidate points, we transform the edge candidate information in the image coordinate system (ICS) into the plane-view image in the world coordinate system (WCS). We define a linear approximation filter and remove faulty edge candidate points by using it. This paper aims to approximate more correctly the lane of an actual road by applying the least-mean square method with the fault-removed edge information for curve fitting."

The striking similarity of the two problems in this framework allows us to design and analyze algorithms for both simultaneously, and to easily adapt algorithms designed for one problem to the other. For both problems, we give new algorithms and explain their potential advantages over existing methods. These algorithms are iterative and can be divided into two types based on whether the parameters are updated sequentially (one at a time) or in parallel (all at once). We also describe a parameterized family of algorithms that includes both a sequential- and a parallel-update algorithm as special cases, thus showing how the sequential and parallel approaches can themselves be unified. For all of the algorithms, we give convergence proofs using a general formalization of the auxiliary-function proof technique. As one of our sequential-update algorithms is equivalent to AdaBoost, this provides the first general proof of convergence for AdaBoost. We show that all of our algorithms generalize easily to the multiclass case, and we contrast the new algorithms with the iterative scaling algorithm. We conclude with a few experimental results with synthetic data that highlight the behavior of the old and newly proposed algorithms in different settings."

The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty\u0097and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition\u0097in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability."

Our algorithm involves a feature-weighted version of the k-nearest-neighbor algorithm. It is able to capture complex dependency of the target function on its input and makes use of the leave-one-out error as a natural regularization. We explain the characteristics of our algorithm on synthetic problems and use it in the context of predicting hand velocity from spikes recorded in motor cortex of a behaving monkey. By applying feature selection we are able to improve prediction quality and suggest a novel way of exploring neural data."
