The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents (\u201csemantic structure\u201d) in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising."

Roget's categories serve as approximations of conceptual classes. The categories listed for a word in Roget's index tend to correspond to sense distinctions; thus selecting the most likely category provides a useful level of sense disambiguation. The selection of categories is accomplished by identifying and weighting words that are indicative of each category when seen in context, using a Bayesian theoretical framework.Other statistical approaches have required special corpora or hand-labeled training examples for much of the lexicon. Our use of class models overcomes this knowledge acquisition bottleneck, enabling training on unrestricted monolingual text without human intervention. Applied to the 10 million word Grolier's Encyclopedia, the system correctly disambiguated 92% of the instances of 12 polysemous words that have been previously studied in the literature."

                "text": "Word sense disambiguation has been recognized as a major problem in natural language processing research for over forty years. Much of this work has been stymied by difficulties in acquiring appropriate lexical resources, such as semantic networks and annotated corpora. Following the suggestion in Brown et al. (1991a) and Dagan et al. (1991), we have achieved considerable progress recently by taking advantage of a new source of testing and training materials. Rather than depending on small amounts of hand-labeled text, we have been making use of relatively large amounts of parallel text, text such as the Canadian Hansards (parliamentary debates), which are available in two (or more) languages. The translation can often be used in lieu of hand-labeling. For example, consider the polysemous word sentence, which has two major senses: (1) a judicial sentence, and (2), a syntactic sentence. We can collect a number of sense (1) examples by extracting instances that are translated as peine, and we can collect a number of sense (2) examples by extracting instances that are translated as phrase. In this way, we have been able to acquire a considerable amount of testing and training material for developing and testing our disambiguation algorithms. The availability of this testing and training material has enabled us to develop quantitative disambiguation methods that achieve 90% accuracy in discriminating between two very distinct senses of a noun such as sentence. In the training phase, we collect a number of instances of each sense of the polysemous noun. Then in the testing phase, we are given a new instance of the noun, and are asked to assign the instance to one of the senses. We attempt to answer this question by comparing the context of the unknown instance with contexts of known instances using a Bayesian argument that has been applied successfully in related applications such as author identification and information retrieval. The final section of the paper will describe a number of methodological studies which show that the training set need not be large and that it need not be free from errors. Perhaps most surprisingly, we find that the context should extend \u00b150 words, an order of magnitude larger than one typically finds in the literature. 1. Word-Sense Disambiguation Consider, for example, the word duty which has at least two quite distinct senses: (1) a tax and (2) an obligation. Three examples of each sense are given in Table 1 below. The classic disambiguation problem is to construct a means for discriminating between two or more sets of examples such as those shown in Table 1. This paper will focus on the methodology required to address the classic problem, and will have less to say about the details required for practical application of this methodology. Consequently, me reader should exercise some caution in interpreting the 90% figure reported here; this figure could easily be swamped out in a practical system by any number of factors that go beyond the scope of this paper. In particular, the Canadian Hansards, one of just the few currently available sources of parallel text, is extremely unbalanced, and is therefore severely limited as a basis for a practical disambiguation system."

Objections to its use fall into two main categories: first, that clustering is too slow for large corpora (with running time often quadratic in the number of documents); and second, that clustering does not appreciably improve retrieval.\nWe argue that these problems arise only when clustering is used in an attempt to improve conventional search techniques. However, looking at clustering as an information access tool in its own right obviates these objections, and provides a powerful new access paradigm. We present a document browsing technique that employs document clustering as its primary operation.

(Generally speaking, subjects respond quicker than normal to the word nurse if it follows a highly associated word such as doctor. ) We will extend the term to provide the basis for a statistical description of a variety of interesting linguistic phenomena, ranging from semantic relations of the doctor/nurse type (content word/content word) to lexico-syntactic co-occurrence constraints between verbs and prepositions (content word/function word). This paper will propose an objective measure based on the information theoretic notion of mutual information, for estimating word association norms from computer readable corpora. (The standard method of obtaining word association norms, testing a few thousand subjects on a few hundred words, is both costly and unreliable.) The proposed measure, the association ratio, estimates word association norms directly from computer readable corpora, making it possible to estimate norms for tens of thousands of words."

Consideration is given to linear algebra in PDP, the logic of additive functions, resource requirements of standard and programmable nets, and the P3 parallel-network simulating system."
