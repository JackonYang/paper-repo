                "text": "These notes are the contents of a lecture course given to third year physics undergraduates at the Imperial College who are taking the theoretical physics option. The subject of \"Algebra and Groups\" is of considerable importance in a number of branches of modern theoretical physics, and therefore one major objective of the course is to introduce the students to the basic ideas on the subject, bearing in mind the potential applications to quantum theory. However, another equally important aim of the course is to introduce the student to the art of genuine \"mathematical\" thinking. The notes are therefore written in a more precise mathematical style than is usually the case in courses aimed at physics students. Quite apart from the general educational value of such an exposure to abstract thinking, it is also the case that much modern theoretical physics draws on sophisticated ideas from pure mathematics and therefore it is most important that a perspective graduate student can approach these subjects without experiencing a total culture shock! The course is divided into three parts. The first is a short introduction to general group theory, with particular emphasis being placed on the matrix Lie groups that play such a crucial role in modern theoretical physics. The second part deals with the theory of vector spaces, with particular attention being paid to the theory of Hilbert spaces and the basic analytical techniques that are needed to handle the infinite dimensional situation. The final part of the course is a short introduction to the theory of group representations and the associated theory of characters."

Drawing on ideas from mathematics, computer science, and philosophy, this book addresses the definition and place of information in society. The authors, observing that information flow is possible only within a connected distribution system, provide a mathematically rigorous, philosophically sound foundation for a science of information. They illustrate their theory by applying it to a wide range of phenomena, from file transfer to DNA, from quantum mechanics to speech act theory."

Directly associated with this controversy is the issue of whether logic is an empirical science on the par with, e.g., physical geometry. This article is not concerned, however, with the general question of the empirical character of logic, either classical or quantal; it is rather concerned only with one seemingly decisive objection against regarding QL as logic, namely, the objection advanced by Jauch and Piron (1970, p. 176), who argue that since QL lacks an essential feature of logic \u2014 viz., a deduction scheme \u2014 it is `very questionable whether we may properly call the lattice of general quantum mechanics a logic.\u2019 Their argument is based on what they regard to be the general failure of the lattice of QL propositions to admit a material implication connective or conditional operation by means of which the modus ponens deduction scheme can be incorporated into QL. The view of Jauch and Piron is also supported by Greechie and Gudder (1971, 1973), who examine a number of results which suggest that no reasonable material conditional exists in QL."
