When the object performs an action in 3D, the points on the outer boundary of the object are projected as 2D (x, y) contour in the image plane. A sequence of such 2D contours with respect to time generates a spatiotemporal volume (STV) in (x, y, t), which can be treated as 3D object in the (x, y, t) space. We analyze STV by using the differential geometric surface properties to identify action descriptors capturing both spatial and temporal properties. A set of action descriptors is called an action sketch. The first step in our approach is to generate STV by solving the point correspondence problem between consecutive frames. The correspondences are determined using a two-step graph theoretical approach. After the STV is generated, actions descriptors are computed by analyzing the differential geometric properties of STV. Finally, using these descriptors, we perform action recognition, which is also formulated as graph theoretical problem. Several experimental results are presented to demonstrate our approach."

We regard human actions as three-dimensional shapes induced by the silhouettes in the space-time volume. We adopt a recent approach [14] for analyzing 2D shapes and generalize it to deal with volumetric space-time action shapes. Our method utilizes properties of the solution to the Poisson equation to extract space-time features such as local space-time saliency, action dynamics, shape structure, and orientation. We show that these features are useful for action recognition, detection, and clustering. The method is fast, does not require video alignment, and is applicable in (but not limited to) many scenarios where the background is known. Moreover, we demonstrate the robustness of our method to partial occlusions, nonrigid deformations, significant changes in scale and viewpoint, high irregularities in the performance of an action, and low-quality video."

Motivated by the recent success of similar ideas in object detection on static images, we generalize the notion of 2D box features to 3D spatio-temporal volumetric features. This general framework enables us to do real-time video analysis. We construct a realtime event detector for each action of interest by learning a cascade of filters based on volumetric features that efficiently scans video sequences in space and time. This event detector recognizes actions that are traditionally problematic for interest point methods - such as smooth motions where insufficient space-time interest points are available. Our experiments demonstrate that the technique accurately detects actions on real-world sequences and is robust to changes in viewpoint, scale and action speed. We also adapt our technique to the related task of human action classification and confirm that it achieves performance comparable to a current interest point based human activity recognizer on a standard database of human activities."

We introduce a novel motion descriptor based on optical flow measurements in a spatiotemporal volume for each stabilized human figure, and an associated similarity measure to be used in a nearest-neighbor framework. Making use of noisy optical flow measurements is the key challenge, which is addressed by treating optical flow not as precise pixel displacements, but rather as a spatial pattern of noisy measurements which are carefully smoothed and aggregated to form our spatiotemporal motion descriptor. To classify the action being performed by a human figure in a query sequence, we retrieve nearest neighbor(s) from a database of stored, annotated video sequences. We can also use these retrieved exemplars to transfer 2D/3D skeletons onto the figures in the query sequence, as well as two forms of data-based action synthesis \"do as I do\" and \"do as I say\". Results are demonstrated on ballet, tennis as well as football datasets."

The main advantages of the method are that it is simple, computationally efficient and intrinsically invariant. We present results for simultaneously classifying seven semantic visual categories.

This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds."

                "text": "We present a novel unsupervised learning method for human action categories. A video sequence is represented as a collection of spatial-temporal words by extracting space-time interest points. The algorithm automatically learns the probability distributions of the spatial-temporal words and the intermediate topics corresponding to human action categories. This is achieved by using latent topic models such as the probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) model and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Our approach can handle noisy feature points arisen from dynamic background and moving cameras due to the application of the probabilistic models. Given a novel video sequence, the algorithm can categorize and localize the human action(s) contained in the video. We test our algorithm on three challenging datasets: the KTH human motion dataset, the Weizmann human action dataset, and a recent dataset of figure skating actions. Our results reflect the promise of such a simple approach. In addition, our algorithm can recognize and localize multiple actions in long and complex video sequences containing multiple motions."

With our Triclops stereo vision system, experiments show that these features are robustly matched between views, 3D landmarks are tracked, robot pose is estimated and a 3D map is built."

This detector is part of a multi-sensor data acquisition and analysis system for driver performance assessment and training. Eye blinks are detected inside regions of interest that are aligned with the subject's eyes at initialization. Alignment is maintained through time by tracking SIFT feature points that are used to estimate the affine transformation between the initial face pose and the pose in subsequent frames. The GPU implementation of the SIFT feature point extraction algorithm ensures real-time processing. An eye blink detection rate of 97% is obtained on a video dataset of 33,000 frames showing 237 blinks from 22 subjects."

Fundamentally, this problem requires recognition, as we need to know which parts of the panorama join up. Previous approaches have used human input or restrictions on the image sequence for the matching step. In this work we use object recognition techniques based on invariant local features to select matching images, and a probabilistic model for verification. Because of this our method is insensitive to the ordering, orientation, scale and illumination of the images. It is also insensitive to 'noise' images which are not part of the panorama at all, that is, it recognises panoramas. This suggests a useful application for photographers: the system takes as input the images on an entire flash card or film, recognises images that form part of a panorama, and stitches them with no user input whatsoever."
