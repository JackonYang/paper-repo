We present a framework for non-rigid matching that begins with a skeleton module, affine point matching, and then integrates multiple features to improve correspondence and develops an object representation based on spatial regions to model local transformations. The algorithm for feature matching iteratively updates the transformation parameters and the correspondence solution, each in turn. The affine mapping is solved in closed form, which permits its use for data of any dimension. The correspondence is set via a method for two-way constraint satisfaction, called softassign, which has recently emerged from the neural network/statistical physics realm. The complexity of the non-rigid matching algorithm with multiple features is the same as that of the affine point matching algorithm. Results for synthetic and real world data are provided for point sets in 2D and 3D, and for 2D data with multiple types of features and parts."

The method handles the full six degrees of freedom and is based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which requires only a procedure to find the closest point on a geometric entity to a given point. The ICP algorithm always converges monotonically to the nearest local minimum of a mean-square distance metric, and the rate of convergence is rapid during the first few iterations. Therefore, given an adequate set of initial rotations and translations for a particular class of objects with a certain level of 'shape complexity', one can globally minimize the mean-square distance metric over all six degrees of freedom by testing each initial registration. One important application of this method is to register sensed data from unfixtured rigid objects with an ideal geometric model, prior to shape inspection. Experimental results show the capabilities of the registration algorithm on point sets, curves, and surfaces. >"

However, there are no general invariant functions when one considers a single 2-D image of a 3-D scene. One possible response to the lack of true invariants is to attempt to generalize the notion of an invariant by finding the most economical characterization possible of the set of all 2-D images that a group of 3-D features may produce. A true invariant exists when, for each model, we can represent all its images at a single point in some representational space. When this is not possible, it is still very useful to find the simplest and lowest-dimensional representation of each model's images."

The recognition task includes both locating the overall pattern and identifying each of its features. Location is achieved by finding a geometric registration function that does a good job of superimposing the instance and the model. Identifying the features requires matching each model feature with the corresponding instance feature.A pruned tree-search algorithm is developed which makes effective use of the Soviet ellipsoid algorithm for feasibility of linear constraints. An interesting blend of theoretical analysis and practical implementation shows that the resulting algorithm has an expected runtime that is theoretically asymptotically quadratic in the number of feature points, but practically linear in n for patterns with fewer than 100 points.Contents: Introduction; Task Abstraction; Prior Approaches; A Linear Programming Approach; Geometry of Registrations and Ellipsoids; Worst-Case Number of Feasible Matchings; Random Patterns; Expected Cost of Feasibility Testing; Expected Size of Search Tree; Monte Carlo Trials; Conclusions.Henry S.

Techniques from statistical physics, which can be interpreted as computing marginal probability distributions, are then used to analyze these models and are shown to (1) relate them to existing theories and (2) give insight into the relations between, and relative effectivenesses of, existing theories. In particular we exploit the power of statistical techniques to put global constraints on the set of allowable states of the binary matching elements. The binary elements can then be removed analytically before minimization. This is demonstrated to be preferable to existing methods of imposing such constraints by adding bias terms in the energy functions. We give applications to winner-take-all networks, correspondence for stereo and long-range motion, the traveling salesman problem, deformable template matching, learning, content addressable memories, and models of brain development. The biological plausibility of these networks is briefly discussed."

The incremental nature of the method makes it possible to process images one at a time, moving away from the storage-intensive batch methods of the past. It is based on the observation that the trajectories that points on the object form in weak-perspective image sequences are linear combinations of three of the trajectories themselves, and that the coefficients of the linear combinations represent shape in an affine-invariant basis. A nonlinear but numerically sound preprocessing state is added to improve the accuracy of the results even further. Experiments showed that attention to noise and computational techniques improved the shape results substantially with respect to previous methods.<<ETX>>"

The method is based on the idea of describing objects in terms of generalized symmetries, as defined by each object's eigenmodes. The resulting modal description is used for object recognition and categorization, where shape similarities are expressed as the amounts of modal deformation energy needed to align the two objects. In general, modes provide a global-to-local ordering of shape deformation and thus allow for selecting which types of deformations are used in object alignment and comparison. In contrast to previous techniques, which required correspondence to be computed with an initial or prototype shape, modal matching utilizes a new type of finite element formulation that allows for an object's eigenmodes to be computed directly from available image information. This improved formulation provides greater generality and accuracy, and is applicable to data of any dimensionality. Correspondence results with 2D contour and point feature data are shown, and recognition experiments with 2D images of hand tools and airplanes are described. >"

The objects are modeled as polyhedra (or polygons) having up to six degrees of positional freedom relative to the sensors. The approach operates by examining all hypotheses about pairings between sensed data and object surfaces and efficiently discarding inconsistent ones by using local constraints on: distances between faces, angles between face normals, and angles (relative to the surface normals) of vectors between sensed points. The method described here is an extension of a method for recognition and localization of nonoverlapping parts previously described in [18] and [15]."

The computational complexity of the implementation has been a drawback of MRFs. In this paper we derive deterministic approximations to MRFs models. All the theoretical results are obtained in the framework of the mean field theory from statistical mechanics. Because we use MRFs models the mean field equations lead to parallel and iterative algorithms. One of the considered models for image reconstruction is shown to give in a natural way the graduate non-convexity algorithm proposed by Blake and Zisserman."

Examples of this ubiquitous problem in computer vision arise in tasks involving hand-eye coordination (such as assembling or sorting), inspection tasks, gauging operations, and in navigation and localization of mobile robots. This book describes an extended series of experiments into the role of geometry in the critical area of object recognition. It provides precise definitions of the recognition and localization problems, describes the methods used to address them, analyzes the solutions to these problems, and addresses the implications of this analysis.The solution to problems of object recognition are of fundamental importance in many real applications and versions of the techniques described here are already being used in industrial settings. Although a number of questions remain to be solved, the authors provide a valuable framework for understanding both the strengths and limitations of using object shape to guide recognition.W. Eric L.

Two major steps of image registration, control-point selection and control-point matching, are emphasized. In control-point selection, the properties that a good control point should satisfy are defined. Several potential control-point candidates are suggested, and methods are discussed for extracting them from the input image. In control-point matching, a relaxation algorithm proposed in the literature is improved by reducing its time complexity from O(n/sup 4/) to O(n/sup 3/), where n is the number of control points. The matching algorithm also uses a two-way matching concept which utilizes the inherent symmetry property of the point-matching problem. The robustness of the proposed algorithm was demonstrated through simulation experiments by evaluating a matching index. Experimental results on Landsat images show that the proposed method produces results comparable to those obtained by an experienced photointerpreter. >"

Building upon recent techniques from statistical physics, such as deterministic annealing which helps avoid some local minima, and the softmax which enforces a one-way constraint without a penalty term, a new optimization technique is introduced--the softassign. The softassign is specifically geared to the types of problems being examined--matching problems--which often require two-way (assignment) constraints. It eliminates the need for penalty terms in these objective functions. \nThe softassign is applied to three types of problems, the first of which is the matching of structural representations--graphs, A new algorithm is introduced which can match unweighted, weighted and attributed relational graphs. This algorithm employs a sparse distance measure between the links of the two graphs. Experiments on randomly generated graphs, and on graphs generated from images are presented. \nThe second problem is the matching of spatial representations--two sets of feature points located in two dimensional space. The feature points may be specified solely by their Cartesian coordinates, or there may be a feature vector associated with them. It is assumed the two sets of feature points are related by an affine transformation. Within Computer Vision this is known as a pose estimation and correspondence problem. A new algorithm is introduced and experiments on randomly generated point sets are run. Experiments on hand-written characters are presented. \nFinally the problem of learning spatial and structural representations is addressed. A new algorithm for clustering is introduced, which uses as distance measures versions of the point matching and graph matching algorithms. Point set and graph prototypes are learned in an unsupervised fashion. Experiments on randomly generated data sets, and data sets generated from hand-written characters are run."

Recently it has been shown that their algorithm is related to neural networks of Hopfield and Tank, and that they both can be understood as the semiclassical approximation to statistical mechanics of related physical models. The main point of the elastic net algorithm is seen to be in the way one deals with the constraints when evaluating the effective cost function (free energy in the thermodynamic analogy), and not in its geometric foundation emphasized originally by Durbin and Willshaw. As a consequence, the elastic net algorithm is a special case of the more general physically based computations and can be generalized to a large class of nongeometric problems. In this paper we further elaborate on this observation, and generalize the elastic net to the quadratic assignment problem. We work out in detail its special case, the graph matching problem, because it is an important problem with many applications in computational vision and neural modeling. Simulation results on random graphs, and on structured (hand-designed) graphs of moderate size (20-100 nodes) are discussed."

This correspondence describes a system that is capable of indexing using sets of three points undergoing 3D transformations and projection by taking advantage of the probabilistic peaking effect. To be able to index using sets of three points, we must allow false negatives. These are overcome by ensuring that we examine several correct hypotheses. The use of these techniques to speed up the alignment method is described. Results are given on real and synthetic data. >"

Thus, this distance can be used to determine the degree of resemblance between two objects that are superimposed on one another. Efficient algorithms for computing the Hausdorff distance between all possible relative positions of a binary image and a model are presented. The focus is primarily on the case in which the model is only allowed to translate with respect to the image. The techniques are extended to rigid motion. The Hausdorff distance computation differs from many other shape comparison methods in that no correspondence between the model and the image is derived. The method is quite tolerant of small position errors such as those that occur with edge detectors and other feature extraction methods. It is shown that the method extends naturally to the problem of comparing a portion of a model against an image. >"

For each known digit, the control points have preferred \"home\" locations, and deformations of the digit are generated by moving the control points away from their home locations. Images of digits can be produced by placing Gaussian ink generators uniformly along the spline. Real images can be recognized by finding the digit model most likely to have generated the data. For each digit model we use an elastic matching algorithm to minimize an energy function that includes both the deformation energy of the digit model and the log probability that the model would generate the inked pixels in the image. The model with the lowest total energy wins. If a uniform noise process is included in the model of image generation, some of the inked pixels can be rejected as noise as a digit model is fitting a poorly segmented image. The digit models learn by modifying the home locations of the control points."

By combining graduated nonconvexity, two-way (assignment) constraints, and sparsity, large improvements in accuracy and speed are achieved. Its low order computational complexity [O(lm), where l and m are the number of links in the two graphs] and robustness in the presence of noise offer advantages over traditional combinatorial approaches. The algorithm, not restricted to any special class of graph, is applied to subgraph isomorphism, weighted graph matching, and attributed relational graph matching. To illustrate the performance of the algorithm, attributed relational graphs derived from objects are matched. Then, results from twenty-five thousand experiments conducted on 100 mode random graphs of varying types (graphs with only zero-one links, weighted graphs, and graphs with node attributes and multiple link types) are reported. No comparable results have been reported by any other graph matching algorithm before in the research literature. Twenty-five hundred control experiments are conducted using a relaxation labeling algorithm and large improvements in accuracy are demonstrated."

This architecture is constructed by combining the following techniques: (1) deterministic annealing, (2) self-amplification, (3) algebraic transformations, (4) clocked objectives, and (5) softassign. Deterministic annealing in conjunction with self-amplification avoids poor local minima and ensures that a vertex of the hypercube is reached. Algebraic transformations and clocked objectives help partition the relaxation into distinct phases. The problems considered have doubly stochastic matrix constraints or minor variations thereof. We introduce a new technique, softassign, which is used to satisfy this constraint. Experimental results on different problems are presented and discussed."

Although these algorithms have been shown experimentally to be successful there has been little theoretical analysis of them. In this paper we demonstrate connections between mean field theory methods and other approaches, in particular, barrier function and interior point methods. As an explicit example, we summarize our work on the linear assignment problem. In this previous work we defined a number of algorithms, including deterministic annealing, for solving the assignment problem. We proved convergence, gave bounds on the convergence times, and showed relations to other optimization algorithms."

We consider the graph partition and the travelling salesman problems. The key new ingredient is a reduction of solution space by one dimension by using graded neurons, thereby avoiding the destructive redundancy that has plagued these problems when using straightforward neural network techniques. This approach maps the problems onto Potts glass rather than spin glass theories. A systematic prescription is given for estimating the phase transition temperatures in advance, which facilitates the choice of optimal parameters. This analysis, which is performed for both serial and synchronous updating of the mean field theory equations, makes it possible to consistently avoid chaotic behavior.When exploring this new technique numerically we find the results very encouraging; the quality of the solutions are in parity with those obtained by using optimally tuned simulated annealing heuristics. Our numerical study, which for TSP extends to 200-city problems, exhibits an impressive level of parameter insensitivity. (Less)"

                "text": "We had previously shown that regularization principles lead to approximation schemes that are equivalent to networks with one layer of hidden units, called regularization networks. In particular, standard smoothness functionals lead to a subclass of regularization networks, the well known radial basis functions approximation schemes. This paper shows that regularization networks encompass a much broader range of approximation schemes, including many of the popular general additive models and some of the neural networks. In particular, we introduce new classes of smoothness functionals that lead to different classes of basis functions. Additive splines as well as some tensor product splines can be obtained from appropriate classes of smoothness functionals. Furthermore, the same generalization that extends radial basis functions (RBF) to hyper basis functions (HBF) also leads from additive models to ridge approximation models, containing as special cases Breiman's hinge functions, some forms of projection pursuit regression, and several types of neural networks. We propose to use the term generalized regularization networks for this broad class of approximation schemes that follow from an extension of regularization. In the probabilistic interpretation of regularization, the different classes of basis functions correspond to different classes of prior probabilities on the approximating function spaces, and therefore to different types of smoothness assumptions. In summary, different multilayer networks with one hidden layer, which we collectively call generalized regularization networks, correspond to different classes of priors and associated smoothness functionals in a classical regularization principle. Three broad classes are (1) radial basis functions that can be generalized to hyper basis functions, (2) some tensor product splines, and (3) additive splines that can be generalized to schemes of the type of ridge approximation, hinge functions, and several perceptron-like neural networks with one hidden layer."

Based on network simulation results they conclude that analog VLSI neural nets can be promising in solving these problems. Recently, Wilson and Pawley presented the results of their simulations which contradict the original results and cast doubts on the usefulness of neural nets. In this paper we give the results of our simulations that clarify some of the discrepancies. We also investigate the scaling of TSP solutions found by neural nets as the size of the problem increases. Further, we consider the neural net solution of the Clustering Problem, also a computationally hard problem, and discuss the types of problems that appear to be well suited for a neural net approach."

We show that once we have modified the output layer of a multilayer perceptron to provide mathematically correct probability distributions, and replaced the usual squared error criterion with a probability-based score, the result is equivalent to Maximum Mutual Information training, which has been used successfully to improve the performance of hidden Markov models for speech recognition. If the network is specially constructed to perform the recognition computations of a given kind of stochastic model based classifier then we obtain a method for discrimination-based training of the parameters of the models. Examples include an HMM-based word discriminator, which we call an 'Alphanet'."

The MFA algorithm combines characteristics of the simulated annealing algorithm and the Hopfield neural network. MFA exhibits the rapid convergence of the neural network while preserving the solution quality afforded by stochastic simulated annealing (SSA). The MFA algorithm is developed in the context of the graph partitioning problem. The rate of convergence of MFA on graph bipartitioning problems is as much as 50 times that of SSA, yet does not degrade the quality of the final solution. The temperature behavior of MFA during bipartitioning is analyzed and shown to have an impact on the tuning of neural networks for improved performance. Also presented is a new modification to MFA that supports partitioning of random or structured graphs into three or more bins-a problem that has previously shown resistance to solution by neural networks.<<ETX>>"
