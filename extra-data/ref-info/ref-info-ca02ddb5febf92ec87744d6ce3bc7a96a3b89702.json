Lines and tables are among the most frequent graphic, non-textual entities in documents and their detection is directly related to the OCR performance as well as to the document layout description. We propose a workflow for table detection that comprises three distinct steps: (i) image pre-processing; (ii) horizontal and vertical line detection and (iii) table detection. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated by using a performance evaluation scheme which considers a great variety of documents such as forms, newspapers/magazines, scientific journals, tickets/bank cheques, certificates and handwritten documents."

The approach is designed as a structured labeling problem, which learns the layout of the document and labels its various entities as table header, table trailer, table cell and non-table region. We develop features which encode the foreground block characteristics and the contextual information. These features are provided to a fixed point model which learns the inter-relationship between the blocks. The fixed point model attains a contraction mapping and provides a unique label to each block. We compare the results with Condition Random Fields(CRFs). Unlike CRFs, the fixed point model captures the context information in terms of the neighbourhood layout more efficiently. Experiments on the images picked from UW-III (University of Washington) dataset, UNLV dataset and our dataset consisting of document images with multicolumn page layout, show the applicability of our algorithm in layout analysis and table detection."

The method employs a run-length approach to identify the horizontal and vertical lines present in the input image. From each group of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines, a set of 26 low-level features are extracted and an SVM classifier is used to test if it belongs to a table or not. The performance of the method is evaluated on a heterogeneous corpus of French, English and Arabic documents that contain various types of table structures and compared with that of the Tesseract OCR system."

In this paper, we propose a novel and effective table detection method via visual separators and geometric content layout information, targeting at PDF documents. The visual separators refer to not only the graphic ruling lines but also the white spaces to handle tables with or without ruling lines. Furthermore, we detect page columns in order to assist table region delimitation in complex layout pages. Evaluations of our algorithm on an e-Book dataset and a scientific document dataset show competitive performance. It is noteworthy that the proposed method has been successfully incorporated into a commercial software package for large-scale Chinese e-Book production."

Table, a ubiquitous document component, becomes an important information source. Accurately detecting the table boundary plays a crucial role for many applications, e.g., the increasing demand on the table data search. Rather than converting PDFs to image or HTML and then processing with other techniques (e.g., OCR), extracting and analyzing texts from PDFs directly is easy and accurate. However, text extraction tools face a common problem: text sequence error. In this paper, we propose two algorithms to recover the sequence of extracted sparse lines, which improve the table content collection. The experimental results show the comparison of the performance of both algorithms, and demonstrate the effectiveness of text sequence recovering for the table boundary detection."

Tables, as a specific document component, are ubiquitous everywhere. Accurately detecting the table boundary plays a crucial role for the later table structure decomposition and table data collection. In this paper, we propose an easy but effective table boundary detection method. Our method has two unique advantages comparing with other works in this field: 1) Because most tables are text-based, we claim that the text object of PDF itself is good enough for table detection. In addition, we believe that the font information is not so reliable as other works stated. 2) Based on the nature of the table cells, we notice the sparse-line property of table rows. By filtering out the non-sparse lines initially, the table boundary detection problem can be simplified into the sparse line analysis problem easily. The experimental results not only confirm the importance of the coordinate information, but also demonstrate the effectiveness of sparse lines in the table boundary detection. Combining with other keywords, our method is even applicable to detect other document components (e.g., mathematical formula or the references)."

In this paper, we present a robust system which is capable of detecting tables from free style online ink notes and extracting their structure so that they can be further edited in multiple ways. First, the primitive structure of tables, i.e., candidates for ruling lines and table bounding boxes, are detected among drawing strokes. Second, the logical structure of tables is determined by normalizing the table skeletons, identifying the skeleton structure, and extracting the cell contents. The detection process is similar to a decision tree so that invalid candidates can be ruled out quickly. Experimental results suggest that our system is robust and accurate in dealing with tables having complex structure or drawn under complex situations"

However, often, the most important information being reported in an article is presented in tabular form in a digital document. If the data reported in tables can be extracted and stored in a database, the data can be queried and joined with other data using database management systems. In order to prepare the data source for table search, accurately detecting the table boundary plays a crucial role for the later table structure decomposition. Table boundary detection and content extraction is a challenging problem because tabular formats are not standardized across all documents. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective preprocessing method to improve the table boundary detection performance by considering the sparse-line property of table rows. Our method easily simplifies the table boundary detection problem into the sparse line analysis problem with much less noise. We design eight line label types and apply two machine learning techniques, Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), on the table boundary detection field. The experimental results not only compare the performances between the machine learning methods and the heuristics-based method, but also demonstrate the effectiveness of the sparse line analysis in the table boundary detection."

Despite the abundance of these techniques, an objective comparison of their performance is still missing. The Table Competition held in the context of ICDAR 2013 is our first attempt at objectively evaluating these techniques against each other in a standardized way, across several input formats. The competition independently addresses three problems: (i) table location, (ii) table structure recognition, and (iii) these two tasks combined. We received results from seven academic systems, which we have also compared against four commercial products. This paper presents our findings."

In order to deal with this problem in the presence of geometric and photometric distortions, we develop new junction detection and labeling methods, where junction detection means to find candidates for the corners of cells, and junction labeling is to infer their connectivity. We consider junctions as the intersections of curves, and so we first develop a multiple curve detection algorithm. After the junction detection, we encode the connectivity information (including false detection) between the junctions into 12 labels, and design a cost function reflecting pairwise relationships as well as local observations. The cost function is minimized via the belief propagation algorithm, and we can locate tables and their cells from the inferred labels. Also, in order to handle multiple tables in a single page, we propose a table area detection method. Our method is based on the well-known recursive X-Y cut, however, we modify the method so that we can also deal with curved seams caused by the geometric distortions. For the evaluation of our method, we build a data set that includes a variety of camera-captured table images and make the set publicly available. Experimental results on the set show that our method successfully locates tables and their cells in camera-captured images."

We present a novel compact visualization which represents the document's key semantic as a mixture of images and important key terms, similar to cards in a top trumps game. The key terms are extracted using an advanced text mining approach based on a fully automatic document structure extraction. The images and their captions are extracted using a graphical heuristic and the captions are used for a semi-semantic image weighting. Furthermore, we use the image color histogram for classification and show at least one representative from each non-empty image class. The approach is demonstrated for the IEEE InfoVis publications of a complete year. The method can easily be applied to other publication collections and sets of documents which contain images."

The computation of the probability measurements takes into consideration tables, table text separators and table neighboring text blocks. Then, an iterative updating method is used to optimize the page segmentation probability to obtain the final result. This new algorithm shows a great improvement over our previous algorithm. The training and testing data set for the algorithm include 1, 125 document pages having 518 table entities and a total of 10, 934 cell entities. Compared with our previous work, it raised the accuracy rate to 95.67% from 90.32% and to 97.05% from 92.04%."

In order to explore, retrieve, and reuse that data, tables should be identified and the data extracted. Table recognition is an old field of research. However, due to the diversity of table styles, the results are still far from satisfactory, and not a single algorithm performs well on all different types of tables. In this paper, we randomly take samples from the CiteSeerX to investigate diverse table styles for automatic table extraction. We find that table headers are one of the main characteristics of complex table styles. We identify a set of features that can be used to segregate headers from tabular data and build a classifier to detect table headers. Our empirical evaluation on PDF documents shows that using a Random Forest classifier achieves an accuracy of 92%.\n \n"

In order to allow efficient access of this information, the content of the documents must be stored in database and information retrieval systems. State-of-the-art indexing techniques mostly rely on the information explicitly available in the text portions of documents. Documents usually contain a significant amount of implicit information such as their logical structure which is not directly accessible (unless the documents are available as well-structured XML-files) and is therefore not used in the search process. In this paper, a new approach for analyzing the logical structure of text documents is presented. The problem of state-of-the-art methods is that they have been developed for a particular type of documents and can only handle documents of that type. In most cases, adaptation and re-training for a different document type is not possible. Our proposed method allows an efficient and effective adaptation of the structure analysis process by combining state-of-the-art machine learning with novel interactive visualization techniques, allowing a quick adaptation of the structure analysis process to unknown document classes and new tasks without requiring a predefined training set."

                "text": "Tables are ubiquitous in digital libraries. In scientific documents, tables are widely used to present experimental results or statistical data in a condensed fashion. However, current search engines do not support table search. The difficulty of automatic extracting tables from un-tagged documents, the lack of a universal table metadata specification, and the limitation of the existing ranking schemes make table search problem challenging. In this paper, we describe TableSeer, a search engine for tables. TableSeer crawls digital libraries, detects tables from documents, extracts tables metadata, indexes and ranks tables, and provides a user-friendly search interface. We propose an extensive set of medium-independent metadata for tables that scientists and other users can adopt for representing table information. In addition, we devise a novel page box-cutting method to improve the performance of the table detection. Given a query, TableSeer ranks the matched tables using an innovative ranking algorithm - TableRank. TableRank rates each \u20edquery, table\u2102 pair with a tailored vector space model and a specific term weighting scheme. Overall, TableSeer eliminates the burden of manually extract table data from digital libraries and enables users to automatically examine tables. We demonstrate the value of TableSeer with empirical studies on scientific documents."

This paper shows how dataflow properties can be analyzed at compile-time to make buffering more efficient. Since the target code corresponding to each node of an SDF graph is normally obtained from a hand-optimized library of predefined blocks, the efficiency of data transfer between blocks is often the limiting factor in how closely an SDF compiler can approximate meticulous manual coding. Furthermore, in the presence of large sample-rate changes, straightforward buffering techniques can quickly exhaust limited on-chip data memory, necessitating the use of slower external memory. The techniques presented in this paper address both of these problems in a unified manner."
