For computational reasons the set is also (e) orthogonal and lends itself to (f) rapid computation. The systems are derived from concepts in matrix algebra, but are closely connected to decompositions based on quadrature mirror filters. Our computations take place hierarchically, leading to a pyramid representation in which all of the basis functions have the same basic shape, and appear at many scales. By placing the high-pass and low-pass kernels on staggered grids, we can derived odd-tap QMF kernels that are quite compact. We have developed pyramids using separable, quincunx, and hexagonal kernels. Image data compression with the pyramids gives excellent results, both in terms of MSE and visual appearance. A non-orthogonal variant allows good performance with 3-tap basis kernels and the appropriate inverse sampling kernels."

The representation differs from established techniques in that the code elements are localized in spatial frequency as well as in space. Pixel-to-pixel correlations are first removed by subtracting a lowpass filtered copy of the image from the image itself. The result is a net data compression since the difference, or error, image has low variance and entropy, and the low-pass filtered image may represented at reduced sample density. Further data compression is achieved by quantizing the difference image. These steps are then repeated to compress the low-pass image. Iteration of the process at appropriately expanded scales generates a pyramid data structure. The encoding process is equivalent to sampling the image with Laplacian operators of many scales. Thus, the code tends to enhance salient image features. A further advantage of the present code is that it is well suited for many image analysis tasks as well as for image compression. Fast algorithms are described for coding and decoding."

This paper presents a simple yet efficient extension of this concept to the source coding of images. We specify the constraints for a set of two-dimensional quadrature mirror filters (QMF's) for a particular frequency-domain partition, and show that these constraints are satisfied by a separable combination of one-dimensional QMF's. Bits are then optimally allocated among the subbands to minimize the mean-squared error for DPCM coding of the subbands. Also, an adaptive technique is developed to allocate the bits within each subband by means of a local variance mask. Optimum quantization is employed with quantizers matched to the Laplacian distribution. Subband coded images are presented along with their signal-to-noise ratios (SNR's). The SNR performance of the subband coder is compared to that of the adaptive discrete cosine transform (DCT), vector quantization, and differential vector quantization for bit rates of 0.67, 1.0, and 2.0 bits per pixel for 256 \u00d7 256 monochrome images. The adaptive subband coder has the best SNR performance."

To solve these problems, we must be able to relate natural surfaces to their images; this requires a good model of natural surface shapes. Fractal functions are a good choice for modeling 3-D natural surfaces because 1) many physical processes produce a fractal surface shape, 2) fractals are widely used as a graphics tool for generating natural-looking shapes, and 3) a survey of natural imagery has shown that the 3-D fractal surface model, transformed by the image formation process, furnishes an accurate description of both textured and shaded image regions. The 3-D fractal model provides a characterization of 3-D surfaces and their images for which the appropriateness of the model is verifiable. Furthermore, this characterization is stable over transformations of scale and linear transforms of intensity. The 3-D fractal model has been successfully applied to the problems of 1) texture segmentation and classification, 2) estimation of 3-D shape information, and 3) distinguishing between perceptually ``smooth'' and perceptually ``textured'' surfaces in the scene."

We may test whether a given code is sufficient, in the sense of retaining all the information that the human perceives, and necessary, in the sense of retaining only that information. The latter is a test of efficiency. Here, we explore a code modeled on the simple cells of the primate striate cortex. The Cortex transform maps a digital image into a set of subimages (layers) that are bandpass in spatial frequency and orientation. The layers are sampled so as to minimize the number of samples and still avoid aliasing. Samples are quantized in a manner that exploits the bandpass contrast-masking properties of human vision. The entropy of the samples is computed to provide a lower bound on the code size. Finally, the image is reconstructed from the code. We devise psychophysical methods for comparing the original and reconstructed images to evaluate the sufficiency of the code. When each resolution is coded at the threshold for detection artifacts, the image-code size is about 1 bit/pixel."

This result can be generalized to apply to level crossings of any linear differential operator: it applies in particular to ridges and ravines in the image intensity. In the case of the second derivative along the gradient, there is no filter that avoids creation of zero crossings, unless the filtering is performed after the derivative is applied."

In 1977 Marr and Poggio proposed one such computational model, which was characterized as matching certain feature points in difference-of-Gaussian filtered images and using the information obtained by matching coarser resolution representations to restrict the search space for matching finer resolution representations. An implementation of the algorithm and its testing on a range of images was reported in 1980. Since then a number of psychophysical experiments have suggested possible refinements to the model and modifications to the algorithm. As well, recent computational experiments applying the algorithm to a variety of natural images, especially aerial photographs, have led to a number of modifications. In this paper, we present a version of the Marr-Poggio-Grimson algorithm that embodies these modifications, and we illustrate its performance on a series of natural images."

                "text": "If a scene containing fine spatial detail is viewed at constant high photopic luminance, there are two main factors which limit the perception of the fine detail-the quality of the optics of the eye forming the image on the retina and the ability of the retina (coupled to the brain) to resolve the details of that image. In the past there have been many theoretical studies of the potential resolving power of the optics based on consideration of diffraction and the chromatic and spherical aberrations of the eye. It is only recently that objective measurements of the quality of the optics of man in vivo have been obtained (Flamant, 1955; Westheimer & Campbell, 1962; Krauskopf 1962; R6hler, 1962). As will be demonstrated, it is not possible to use these findings to determine the relative weighting that should be given to the optics and the retina in determining a given threshold. This paper reports the results of experiments using an improved version of the well-known interference fringe technique (Le Grand, 1937; Byram 1944; Westheimer, 1960; Arnulf & Dupuy, 1960) which theoretically allows a sinusoidal pattern of very high contrast to be formed directly on the retina. The practical difficulty in using this technique is to obtain a light source of high intrinsic brightness and coherence with which to form high-luminance interference fringes on the retina; this has been solved by using a neon-helium gas laser. By decreasing the contrast (Fig. 1) of the interference fringes with another source of light it was possible to determine the contrasts on the retina at which the fringes are just detected. Thus a measure of the resolving power of the retina-brain is obtained without prior modification by the optics of the eye. Measurements have also been made of the visual resolution of external gratings whose intensity varied sinusoidally with distance across the gratings and which were imaged on to the retina by the optical components of the eye. By comparing the threshold contrasts of these external sinusoidal gratings with thresholds for sinusoidal fringes of the same spatial frequency formed through interference, the quality of the"

The distortion is defined as the expected value of some function of the error between the input and the output of the quantizer. Equations are derived for the parameters of a quantizer with minimum distortion. The equations are not soluble without recourse to numerical methods, so an algorithm is developed to simplify their numerical solution. The case of an input signal with normally distributed amplitude and an expected squared error distortion measure is explicitly computed and values of the optimum quantizer parameters are tabulated. The optimization of a quantizer subject to the restriction that both input and output levels be equally spaced is also treated, and appropriate parameters are tabulated for the same case as above."

These properties concern the relationship between the organizational principle of a two-dimensional anisotropic spatial filter or neural receptive field (such as elongation, or concatenation of subunits, or differential operators mediated by lateral inhibition in neural laminae) and the resulting general consequences for spatial frequency and orientation selectivity. These properties are demonstrated without assuming particular two-dimensional filter functional forms; rather, they are shown as general principles associated with certain broad categories of two-dimensional filters. Such an analysis enhance theoretical understanding of the two-dimensional receptive field organization of neurons in the visual cortex and permits the rejection of some candidate organizational principles on two-dimensional spectral grounds."

In such systems, it is imperative that the individual channel signals be decimated in such a way that the number of samples coded and transmitted do not exceed the number of samples in the original speech signal. Under this constraint, the systems presented in the past have sought to remove the aliasing distortion while minimizing the overall analysis/reconstruction distortion. In this paper, it is shown that it is possible to design tree-structured analysis/reconstruction systems which meet the sampling rate condition and which result in exact reconstruction of the input signal. The conditions for exact reconstruction are developed and presented. Furthermore, it is shown that these conditions are not overly restrictive and high-quality frequency division may be performed in the analysis section. A filter design procedure is presented which allows high-quality filters to be easily designed."

Use of QMF's enables to avoid the aliasing effects due to samples decimation when signal is split into sub-bands. Each sub-band is then coded independently with use of Block Companded PCM (BCPCM) quantizers. Then a variable number of bits is allocated to each sub-band quantizer in order to take advantage of the relative perceptual effect of the quantizing error. The paper is organized as follows: - First, splitting in two sub-bands with QMF's is analysed. -Then, a general description of a splitband voice coding scheme using QMF's is made. -Finally, two coding schemes are considered, operating respectively at 16 KBps and 32 KBps. Averaged values of S/N performances are given when encoding both male and female voices. Comparisons are made with conventional BCPCM and CCITT A-Law. Taped results will be played at the conference."

For a vertical test grating, the elevation in contrast threshold produced by adapting to a high-contrast grating of the same spatial frequency but variable orientation was equated with the contrast levels of a vertical adapting grating that produced equivalent effects (equivalent-contrast transformation). This enabled comparisons to be made between the orientation tuning of the aftereffect at different retinal loci. For the spatial frequency employed (3 cycles deg\u22121), no systematic change in orientation selectivity was found as a function of either retinal eccentricity or the hemifield (and hence the cerebral hemisphere) stimulated."

A method is suggested for designing filters with these characteristics, and their performance and processing requirements are compared with a typical nonrecursive finite impluse response (FIR) realization. A particular filter is described in more detail, and it is shown how it could be incorporated in a multiband processing scheme. It is concluded that recursive quadrature mirror filters could offer considerable savings in terms of signal processing compared with nonrecursive filters with similar performances. Additionally, it is suggested that, because they can be designed to have relatively short absolute delays, the performance of the IIR filters may prove superior for certain applications."

                "text": "OF THE DISCLOSURE A gas Spring for a drawing table which has a cylinder, a piston in the cylinder, and a piston rod projecting from the piston through one end wall of the cylinder, the other end wall being imperforate. Gas under pressure fills the cylinder and may be released from the chamber adjacent the piston rod if the latter is almost fully expelled from the cylinder against a compression spring through a chan nel having orifices in the piston and in the piston rod. Additional gas is admitted to the cylinder of a modified Spring when the piston rod is almost fully retracted into the cylinder and the piston strikes a normally closed valve Separating the cylinder cavity from a storage chamber. SLSSSMSSSLSSSSTSSSTSS The present invention relates to a weight-compensating and equilibrium-maintaining device, and it is the principal object of this invention to provide a very simple and inexpensive device in the form of a so-called gas spring for compensating the weight or maintaining the equi librium of any device or apparatus which is adjustable to different levels or inclinations and for permitting such adjustments to be carried out with the least possible physi cal effort. Among the numerous types of devices and appa ratus to which the present invention may be applied may be mentioned especially: drawing tables, X-ray apparatus, hair driers, tilting doors and windows, covers for large freezer chests, and so forth. In connection with such devices or apparatus it is con ventionai to balance their weight or to maintain their equi librium by the provision of counterweights or coil springs. The employment of counterweights has the disadvantage that they require considerable space and also considerably increase the weight of the entire apparatus. The use of coil springs, on the other hand, has the disadvantage that the operations of compressing or expanding such springs require a considerable force and either require or result in considerable changes inforce which have to be compen sated by special mechanical means such as levers, cams, or other force-transmitting means which considerably in crease the cost of the respective apparatus. Another device which has previously been employed for the above-mentioned purposes is a so-called gas spring which consists of a pneumatic cylinder and piston unit in which the cylinder is filled with a pressure gas, for exam ple, compressed air. Although very successful when spe cially designed for a specific apparatus, these gas springs have the disadvantage that each of them has a very par ticular spring characteristic and that therefore a large number of different gas springs have to be produced and be held available for compensating the different forces of different devices or apparatus and even for compen sating differences in force which might be due to inac curacies of manufacture of an individual apparatus of a series thereof. When such gas springs are to be installed, for example, on a drawing table, it is evident that dif ferent gas springs would be required either for merely balancing the weight of the drawing board itself or for 0."
