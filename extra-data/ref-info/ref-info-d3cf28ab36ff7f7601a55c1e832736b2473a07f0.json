Most of these memory models are process oriented; they explicate the processes that operate on memory representations without explicating the origin of the representations themselves; the different attributes of words are typically represented by random vectors that have no formal relationship to the words in our language. In Part I of this research, we develop Word Association Spaces (WAS) that capture aspects of the meaning of words. This vector representation is based on a statistical analysis of a large database of free association norms. In Part II, this representation along with a representation for the physical aspects of words such as orthography is combined with REM, a process model for memory. Three experiments are presented in which distractor similarity, the length of studied categories and the directionality of association between study and test words were varied. With only a few parameters, the REM model can account qualitatively for the results. Developing a representation incorporating features of actual words makes it possible to derive predictions for individual test words. We show that the moderate correlations between observed and predicted hit and false alarm rates for individual words are larger than can be explained by models that represent words by arbitrary features. In Part III, an experiment is presented that tests a prediction of REM: words with uncommon features should be better recognized than words with common features, even if the words are equated for word frequency."

The problem takes many forms; learning vocabulary from text is an especially dramatic and convenient case for research. A new general theory of acquired similarity and knowledge representation, latent semantic analysis (LSA), is presented and used to successfully simulate such learning and several other psycholinguistic phenomena. By inducing global knowledge indirectly from local co-occurrence data in a large body of representative text, LSA acquired knowledge about the full vocabulary of English at a comparable rate to schoolchildren. LSA uses no prior linguistic or perceptual similarity knowledge; it is based solely on a general mathematical learning method that achieves powerful inductive effects by extracting the right number of dimensions (e.g., 300) to represent objects and contexts. Relations to other theories, phenomena, and problems are sketched."

The curse of man.\" Maxwell (1976, p. 19) \"... how a word 'stands for' a thing or 'means' what the speaker intends to say or 'communicates' some condition of a thing to a listener has never been satisfactorily established\" B. F. Skinner (1957, pp. 114-115) \"... semantic structure of natural languages evidently offers many mysteries\" Noam Chomsky (1965, p. 163) Meaning provides the fundamental bridge between the various language, cognitive, and perceptual components of the language comprehension system. As such, it is important to attempt to model how meaning can be acquired from experience and the specific nature of its representational form. In this chapter, we attempt to deal with the particularly difficult problem of how meaning can be specified. In particular, we are interested in how meaning can be represented in a computational model of meaning and the process by which these representations are formed. Although a review of previous models of word meaning would be outside the scope of this chapter (but see Komatsu, 1992), there are three psychological models that deserve mention because they have inspired current computational approaches in many ways. developed a hierarchical network model of semantic memory. It is a node and link model where knowledge is represented by both concepts (the nodes) and the relations among concepts (the links). Superordinate and subordinate relationships (hence, the hierarchical nature of the model) are represented via the links. The later version of the model, the spreading activation model (Collins & Loftus, 1975), de-emphasized the hierarchical nature of the mental representations in favor of a more general notion of semantic relatedness. The information retrieval process occurs as a function of spreading activation in the structured network. There has been considerable support for the model; the spreading activation approach to meaning retrieval and representation has been extensively used (see Neely, 1991, for a review). The notions of semantic connectedness, spreading activation, perceptual thresholds for conceptual retrieval are present in many more contemporary localist in their feature comparison model, hypothesized that there were two types of semantic features: defining features that were essential to the meaning of the concept and characteristic features that were usually true of the concept. Processing in this model hinged on whether an overall feature comparison or only a comparison using defining features was required for a semantic decision. The processing characteristics of both the spreading activation model and the feature comparison model have \u2026"

Analysis of data from cross-linguistic studies designed to eliminate Inonconceptual differences between words in a language that might account for the Larlier acquisition of nouns--such as the position of a word in the sentence, morphological transparency (the ease with which the root can be heard in various uses of the word), and patterns of language teaching strategies--leaves some version of the Natural Partitions hypothesis as the most reasonable view of early vocabulary acquisition. A cross-linguistic examination of a single sentence suggests that if objecthood is created by spatial relations among perceptual elements, then good concrete objects are particularly cohesive collections of percepts. These highly cohesive collections of perceptual information tend to be lexicalized as nouns by almost every language. Object concepts are given to language users by the world and can be learned one at a time, while predicate concepts form a system in each language., that, from a child's point of view, must be discovered.

The model is discussed in terms of the characteristics of word acquisition and of the relation between 1st words and 1st sentences. While concept formation theory, semantic feature theory, and Piagetian theory are each alone inadequate to account for this process, each makes a necessary contribution to an adequate solution. The resulting model rests on the assumption that the young child translates the dynamic functional relations of objects into conceptual \u201ccore\u201d meanings to which identificational features of concept instances are attached. It differentiates between the meaning of a concept and its referents and relates these to concept generation and concept identification, respectively. Some wider implications of the model for acquiring concepts and general semantic categories and for constructing sentences are briefly considered.

This retrieval is facilitated if one can infer the gist of a sentence, conversation, or document and use that gist to predict related concepts and disambiguate words. This article analyzes the abstract computational problem underlying the extraction and use of gist, formulating this problem as a rational statistical inference. This leads to a novel approach to semantic representation in which word meanings are represented in terms of a set of probabilistic topics. The topic model performs well in predicting word association and the effects of semantic association and ambiguity on a variety of language-processing and memory tasks. It also provides a foundation for developing more richly structured statistical models of language, as the generative process assumed in the topic model can easily be extended to incorporate other kinds of semantic and syntactic structure."

In addressing these issues, I will discuss what I think are some of the central problems facing the lexical semantics community, and suggest ways of best approaching these issues. Then, I will provide a method for the decomposition of lexical categories and outline a theory of lexical semantics embodying a notion of cocompositionality and type coercion, as well as several levels of semantic description, where the semantic load is spread more evenly throughout the lexicon. I argue that lexical decomposition is possible if it is performed generatively. Rather than assuming a fixed set of primitives. I will assume a fixed number of generative devices that can be seen as constructing semantic expressions. I develop a theory of Qualia Structure, a representation language for lexical items, which renders much lexical ambiguity in the lexicon unnecessary, while still explaining the systematic polysemy that words carry. Finally, I discuss how individual lexical structures can be integrated into the larger lexical knowledge base through a theory of lexical inheritance. This provides us with the necessary principles of global organization for the lexicon, enabling us to fully integrate our natural language lexicon into a conceptual whole."

Items, represented as sets of features, are associated by the operation of convolution. The associations are stored by being superimposed in a composite memory trace. Retrieval occurs when a cue item is correlated with the composite trace. The retrieved items are intrinsically noisy, may be ambiguous, and may under certain conditions be systematically distorted from their encoded form. A discrete response is selected by matching the retrieved item to all of the items in semantic memory. The model yields several new predictions about errors in single-trial cued recall that depend on similarity relations among the to-be-remembered items, and also about the efficacy of extralist cues. Experiments are presented that test these predictions against human recall. The model is then applied to several well-known results: prototype abstraction, the A-B A-D paradigm\u2014including the independence of the B and D responses\u2014 and the Osgood transfer surface."

In the present research, we tested an account based on feedback activation by investigating a new semantic variable: number of features (NOF). Words with high NOF (e.g., LION) should activate richer semantic representations than do words with low NOF (e.g., LIME). As a result, the feedback activation from semantics to orthographic and phonological representations should be greater for high-NOF words, which should produce superior lexical decision task (LDT) and naming task performance. The predicted facilitory NOF effects were observed in both LDT and naming."

The research focused on the role of correlations among features, and differences between speeded and untimed tasks with respect to the use of featural information. The results indicate that featural representations are used in the initial computation of word meaning (as in an attractor network), patterns of feature correlations differ between artifacts and living things, and the degree to which features are intercorrelated plays an important role in the organization of semantic memory. The studies also suggest that it may be possible to predict semantic priming effects from independently motivated featural theories of semantic relatedness. Implications for related behavioral phenomena such as the semantic impairments associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are discussed."

That is, typical members of a category should be more similar to one another\u2014they should cluster together more densely and closer to the center of the category. Hierarchical semantic structure is a natural characteristic of the vector representations learned by BEAGLE. Animals cluster distinctly from places or vehicles. Within animals, however, fish, birds, and snakes tend to cluster distinctly from one another as well. Category labels tend to be proximal to the exemplars of the categories they represent. Furthermore, the names for features of a category (e.g., wings, beak) also tend to be more proximal to exemplars of the categories they are features of. Figures 8A and 8B show two-dimensional scaling plots for sports and vehicles, respectively. The smaller gray plots show expansions of the dense regions toward the center of each category. As the figures show, the more typical exemplars are positioned nearer to the algebraic center of the category (the gray regions). In Rosch\u2019s (1975) subjective rating norms, football was ranked number 1 (of 60) by subjects as a good example of a sport, and basketball was ranked number 3. Curling, on the other hand, was ranked 22.5 as a good example of a sport. The labels for each category (sports and vehicle) are also closer to the more typical exemplars. By contrast, the less typical exemplars of each category are sparsely distributed and further from (a) each other, (b) the typical exemplars, and (c) the category label. It is not difficult to see how such a representation could naturally produce a typicality effect: More typical members are more like one another, closer to the category center, and closer to the category label than are less typical ones. As a concrete example of typicality, consider a classic experiment by Rosch (1975, Experiment 2). Rosch primed subjects with a category label and then simultaneously presented two exemplars; the response was simply a same\u2013different category judgment. Typicality of the exemplars, defined by subjective ratings, was varied. The basic findings were that same responses are faster if primed by the category name and that both same and different responses are faster to typical category members than to atypical ones (e.g., robin\u2013sparrow is faster than chicken\u2013peacock, and robin\u2013car is faster than chicken\u2013tractor). More recent neurocognitive research has cross-validated the similarity of neural states implied by Rosch\u2019s typicality response time (RT) data (Kounios & Holcomb, 1992). Figure 9 illustrates Rosch\u2019s (1975) RT data (11 categories) for same responses plotted against BEAGLE\u2019s predictions based on euclidean distance to both the category prototype and the category label using the same stimulus pairs."

They examine the many strands of knowledge and skill -- including perceptual sensitivities, conceptual and semantic constraints, and communicative intent -- that children must weave together in the process of word learning, and show the different mix of these factors used at different developmental points. In considering the many different factors at work, the contributors avoid both the \"either-or\" approach, which singles out one strand to explain word learning throughout childhood, and the \"all-inclusive\" approach, which considers the melange of factors together. Their goal is to discover precisely which strands of ability or understanding make which contributions to acquisition at which points in infancy and childhood.The nineteen chapters are arranged in two broadly thematic sections. The chapters in \"Initial Acquisitions,\" focus on issues involved in word learning during infancy, including how learners represent the sound patterns of words, infants' use of action knowledge to understand the meaning of words, and the links between early word learning and conceptual organization. In \"Later Acquisitions,\" the chapters treat topics concerning the stages of toddler and preschooler language acquisition, including part-of- speech information in word learning, the proper-count distinction, and a comparison of verb acquisition in English and Spanish. Because the contributors present their work in the broader context of the interconnection of different processes in lexical acquisition, the chapters in Weaving a Lexicon should suggest new directions for research in the field."

It works by applying dimension reduction to local co-occurrence data from a large collection of documents after performing singular value decomposition on it. When the reduction is applied, the system forms condensed representations for the words that incorporate higher order associations. The higher order associations are primarily responsible for any semantic similarity between words in LSA. In this article, a memory model is described that creates semantic representations for words that are similar in form to those created by LSA. However, instead of applying dimension reduction, the model builds the representations by using a retrieval mechanism from a well-known account of episodic memory."

But LSA pays no attention to word order, much less sentence structure. Researchers in Natural Language Processing have made significant progress in quickly and accurately deriv- ing the syntactic structure of texts. But there is little agree- ment on how best to represent meaning, and the representa- tions are brittle and difficult to build. This paper evaluates a model of language understanding that combines information from rule-based syntactic processing with a vector-based se- mantic representation which is learned from a corpus. The model is evaluated as a cognitive model, and as a potential technique for natural language understanding. Motivations Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) was originally developed for the task of information retrieval, selecting a text which matches a query from a large database (Deerwester, Du- mais, Furnas, Landauer, & Harshman, 1990) 1 . More re- cently, LSA has been evaluated by psychologists as a model for human lexical acquisition (Landauer & Dumais, 1997). It has been applied to other textual tasks and found to gen- erally perform at levels matching human performance. All this despite the fact that LSA pays no attention to word or- der, let alone syntax. This led Landauer to claim that syntax apparently has no contribution to the meaning of a sentence, and may only serve as a working memory crutch for sen- tence processing, or in a stylistic role (Landauer, Laham, Rehder, & Schreiner, 1997). The tasks that LSA has been shown to perform well on can be separated into two groups: those that deal with sin- gle words and those that deal with longer texts. For exam- ple, on the synonym selection part of the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language), LSA was as accurate at choosing the correct synonym (out of 4 choices) as were successful foreign applicants to US universities (Landauer et al., 1997). For longer texts, Rehder et al (1998) showed that for evaluating author knowledge, LSA does steadily worse for texts shorter than 200 words. More specifically, 1 We do not describe the functioning of the LSA mechanism here. For a complete description, see (Deerwester et al., 1990; Landauer & Dumais, 1997) for 200-word essay segments, LSA accounted for 60% of the variance in human scores. For 60-word essay segments, LSA scores accounted for only 10% of the variance. In work on judging the quality of single-sentence student answers in an intelligent tutoring context, we have shown in previous work that although LSA nears the performance of intermediate-knowledge human raters, it lags far behind expert performance (Wiemer-Hastings, Wiemer-Hastings, & Graesser, 1999b). Furthermore, when we compared LSA to a keyword-based approach, LSA performed only marginally better (Wiemer-Hastings, Wiemer-Hastings, & Graesser, 1999a). This accords with unpublished results on short answer sentences from Walter Kintsch, personal com- munication, January 1999. In the field of Natural Language Processing, the eras of excessive optimism and ensuing disappointment have been followed by study increases in the systems\u2019 ability to pro- cess the syntactic structure of texts with rule-based mecha- nisms. The biggest recent developments have been due to the augmentation of the rules with corpus-derived proba- bilities for when they should be applied (Charniak, 1997; Collins, 1996, 1998, for example). Unfortunately, progress in the area of computing the se- mantic content of texts has not been so successful. Two ba- sic variants of semantic theories have been developed. One is based on some form of logic. The other is represented by connections within semantic networks. In fact, the latter can be simply converted into a logic-based representation. Such theories are brittle in two ways. First, they require every concept and every connection between concepts to be defined by a human knowledge engineer. Multi-purpose representations are not feasible because of the many techni- cal senses of words in every different domain. Second, such representations can not naturally make the graded judge- ments that humans do. Humans can compare any two things (even apples and oranges!), but aside from count- ing feature overlap, logic-based representations have diffi- culty with relationships other than subsumption and \u201chas- as-part\u201d. Due to these various motivations, we are pursuing a two- pronged research project. First, we want to evaluate the combination of a syntactic processing mechanism with an LSA-based semantic representation as a cognitive model of human sentence similarity judgements. Second, we are"

                "text": "This paper presents a spreading-acti vation theory of human semantic processing, which can be applied to a wide range of recent experimental results. The theory is based on Quillian's theory of semantic memory search and semantic preparation, or priming. In conjunction with this, several of the miscondeptions concerning Qullian's theory are discussed. A number of additional assumptions are proposed for his theory in order to apply it to recent experiments. The present paper shows how the extended theory can account for results of several production experiments by Loftus, Juola and Atkinson's multiple-category experiment, Conrad's sentence-verification experiments, and several categorization experiments on the effect of semantic relatedness and typicality by Holyoak and Glass, Rips, Shoben, and Smith, and Rosch. The paper also provides a critique of the Smith, Shoben, and Rips model for categorization judgments. Some years ago, Quillian1 (1962, 1967) proposed a spreading-acti vation theory of human semantic processing that he tried to implement in computer simulations of memory search (Quillian, 1966) and comprehension (Quillian, 1969). The theory viewed memory search as activation spreading from two or more concept nodes in a semantic network until an intersection was found. The effects of preparation (or priming) in semantic memory were also explained in terms of spreading activation from the node of the primed concept. Rather than a theory to explain data, it was a theory designed to show how to build human semantic structure and processing into a computer."

Pexman, Lupker, and Hino (2002) reported faster lexical decision and naming responses for high number of features (NOF) words than for low-NOF words. In the present research, we investigated the impact of NOF on semantic processing. We observed NOF effects in a self-paced reading task when prior context was not congruent with the target word (Experiment 1) and in a semantic categorization task (concrete vs. abstract; Experiment 2A). When we narrowed our stimuli to include high- and low-NOF words from a single category (birds), we found substantial NOF effects that were modulated by the specificity of the categorization task (Experiments 3A, 3B, and 3C). We argue that these results provide support for distributed representation of word meaning."

It is still unclear, however, to what extent syntactic information actually matters for the representation of meaning. LSA (La- tent Semantic Analysis) allows you to derive informa- tion about the meaning without paying attention even to the order of words within a sentence. This is consis- tent with the view that syntax plays a subordinate role for semantic processing of text. But LSA does not per- form as well as humans do in discriminating meanings. Can syntax be the missing link that will help LSA? This paper seeks to address that question. Introduction In the beginning, there was syntax. And it was good. But it did not give us what we really want to know about a text \u2014 what it means. Then there was latent seman- tic analysis (Deerwester, Dumais, Furnas, Landauer, & Harshman, 1990, LSA), which provided a means of com- paring the \u201csemantic\u201d similarity between a source and target text, and thereby giving some idea of meaning of the source. That was good too, almost as good as hu- mans in a simple task, but not quite. Because LSA pays no attention to syntax at all \u2014 not even word order \u2014 one promising approach to improving LSA is by giving it some of the information that is provided by syntax. Knowledge about the syntactic structure of a sentence provides information about the relationships between the words: which words modify which other words, and the relationships between verbs and their arguments or the- matic roles. The research presented here is an attempt to evaluate the bene\ufb01ts of providing LSA with thematic role information which comes from syntactic knowledge. Previous work The primary goal of the AutoTutor project (Graesser, Franklin, Wiemer-Hastings, & the Tutoring Research Group, 1998; Wiemer-Hastings, Wiemer-Hastings, & Graesser, 1999) is to model human tutorial dialogue. It is based on studies of the discourse patterns of hu- man tutors during tutoring sessions (Person, Graesser, Magliano, & Kreuz, 1994). These analyses have shown that human tutors do not have complete understanding of their students\u2019 answers to questions, but the do get an approximation. For AutoTutor, LSA provides such approximate understanding of student inputs by com- paring them to expected answers, and using the LSA cosines as a metric of the extent to which the student entered what was expected. We evaluated this approach by randomly selecting a set of 8 student answers to each of 24 questions in our do- main of computer literacy (Wiemer-Hastings, Graesser, Harter, & the Tutoring Research Group, 1998). We asked human raters to evaluate these answers by pro- viding an aggregate measure of the percentage of stu- dent answer propositions that \u201cmatch\u201d some expected answer proposition. Proposition was de\ufb01ned loosely as an atomic sentence. Match was left to the human raters to de\ufb01ne. Then we performed the same analysis with LSA, modeling the match function by adjusting the co- sine threshold. The best performance was realized with a 200-dimensional space with a cosine threshold of 0.5. This provided a correlation of r = 0.49 with the average rating of the human judges. Because the distribution of ratings was skewed, we also calculated Cronbach\u2019s al- pha. The average alpha score between human raters was \u03b1 = 0.76. The alpha score between LSA and the aver- age human rating was \u03b1 = 0.60. These results were very encouraging. LSA provided much of the discrimination shown by human raters, enough to use in the AutoTutor system. It could however, be improved. The obvious information source that LSA ignores is syntax. It is a \u201cbag-of-words\u201d approach, simply adding together term vectors to make a vector for a text. This paper is an attempt to identify whether the addition of syntactic knowledge can strengthen LSA judgments. Related work Partially as a result of the Behaviorist movement in psy- chology, linguistics and natural language processing fo- cused for a long time primarily on the syntactic structure of sentences (Chomsky, 1981, for example). In the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s, Schank sought to change this by claiming that semantics alone was su\ufb03cient (Schank & Riesbeck, 1981, for example). More recently, researchers from psychol- ogy have championed LSA as both a technique for de- termining the meaning of texts and as a model of human language. Much of the recent interest (and controversy) regard- ing LSA can be traced to Landauer, Kintsch, and col- leagues. They imported LSA from the realm of infor- mation retrieval and hailed it as part or parcel of a psy-"

In this task, subjects listened to sentences that were biased toward either the primary interpretation (a meaning occurring 75% or more of the time) or a secondary interpretation (a meaning occurring less than 25% of the time) of a lexical ambiguity that occurred in each sentence. Simultaneously, subjects made lexical decisions about visually presented words. Decisions to words related to both the primary and secondary meanings of the ambiguity were facilitated when presented immediately following occurrence of the ambiguity in the sentence. This effect held under each of the two biasing context conditions. However, when they were presented 1.5 sec following occurrence of the ambiguity, only visual words related to the contextually relevant meaning of the ambiguity were facilitated. These results support the exhaustive access hypothesis. It is argued that lexical access is an autonomous subsystem of the sentence comprehension routine in which all meanings of a word are momentarily accessed, regardless of the factors of contextual bias or bias associated with frequency of use."

Principal component analysis of the hidden unit activation patterns reveals that the network solves the task by developing complex distributed representations which encode the relevant grammatical relations and hierarchical constituent structure. Differences between the SRN state representations and the more traditional pushdown store are discussed in the final section."

Since children must overcome similar ambiguities, the model provides a possible explanation for learning patterns in children."

Recent work on the computing of semantic distances among nodes (synsets) in WordNet has made it possible to build a large database of semantic distances for use in selecting word pairs for psychological research. The database now contains nearly 50,000 pairs of words that have values for semantic distance, associative strength, and similarity based on co-occurrence. Semantic distance was found to correlate weakly with these other measures but to correlate more strongly with another measure of semantic relatedness, featural similarity. Hierarchical clustering analysis suggested that the knowledge structure underlying semantic distance is similar in gross form to that underlying featural similarity. In experiments in which semantic similarity ratings were used, human participants were able to discriminate semantic distance. Thus, semantic distance as derived from WordNet appears distinct from other measures of word pair relatedness and is psychologically functional. This database may be downloaded fromwww.psychonomic.org/archive/."

Lexical decisions to nonwords were longer than controls only when the nonword was related to the contextually biased sense of the ambiguous word, leading Glucksberg et al. to conclude that context does constrain lexical access and that the multiple access pattern observed in previous studies was probably an artifact of backward priming. We did not find nonword interference when the nonword targets used by Glucksberg et al. were preceded by semantically related ambiguous or unambiguous word primes. However, we did replicate their sentence context results when the ambiguous words were removed from the sentences. We conclude that the interference obtained by Glucksberg et al. is due to postlexical judgements of the congruence of the sentence context and the target, not to context constraining lexical access."

One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction."

Note that a high cosine indicates greater similarity, which, in turn, predicts faster RTs in that condition relative to a condition with lower cosines. A negative priming difference in BEAGLE, thus, predicts positive facilitation in human data (i.e., the unrelated prime\u2013target pairs are less similar than are the related pairs). Chiarello et al. found significant facilitation for semantic-only and semantic plus associated prime\u2013 target pairs. In BEAGLE, the related prime\u2013target pairs had significantly higher cosines than the unrelated pairs in the semantic-only condition, F(1, 47) $ 33.95, p , .001; the associated-only condition, F(1, 47) $ 19.15, p , .001; and the semantic plus associated condition, F(1, 47) $ 114.49, p , .001. The magnitude of the facilitation predicted by BEAGLE differed across the three priming conditions, F(2, 141) $ 10.65, p , .001. Student NewmanKeuls post hoc tests revealed that the differences between all three conditions were significant (i.e., all three groups are homogeneous subsets).

When the target task was pronunciation of highly legible words, context effects were only obtained for normative associates that were also rated as close collocates. No effects were obtained for semantically similar pairs of low association strength. However, when target presentation was degraded, these latter pairs did support an effect. Further experiments found that semantically related but not associated pairs also produced context effects when the target task was lexical decision and the primes were masked. It is argued that, contrary to previous suggestions in the literature, automatic priming effects do have a pure semantic component, but it is meaning retrieval that is primed, not the lexical-level representation of the word.

Recency has been alternatively explained by mechanisms of decay, displacement, and retroactive interference. Another account of recency is based on the idea of variable context (Estes, 1955; Mensink & Raaijmakers, 1989). Such notions are typically cast in terms of a randomly fluctuating population of elements reflective of subtle changes in the environment or in the subjects' mental state. This random context view has recently been incorporated into distributed and neural network memory models (Murdock, 1997; Murdock, Smith, & Bai, 2001). Here we propose an alternative model. Rather than being driven by random fluctuations, this formulation, the temporal context model (TCM), uses retrieval of prior contextual states to drive contextual drift. In TCM, retrieved context is an inherently asymmetric retrieval cue. This allows the model to provide a principled explanation of the widespread advantage for forward recalls in free and serial recall. Modeling data from single-trial free recall, we demonstrate that TCM can simultaneously explain recency and contiguity effects across time scales."

In the present review, I critically examine the individual studies claiming evidence of featural and associative relations in semantic memory. The most important conclusion is that automatic priming appears to be due to both association strength and feature overlap. Mediated associates provide the strongest evidence of automatic associative priming, whereas functional associates, synonyms, and antonyms instead support priming based on feature overlap. In contrast, automatic priming does not occur for category coordinates or perceptually similar items, at least when presented in the visual modality. The status of other relations, such as collocates, episodic relatives, and script relations, is unclear and requires further experimentation. Implications for current models of semantic representation and priming are discussed."

Prime-target pairs were constructed such that there was a relation between the prime (e.g., lion) and the target (e.g., stripes) only through a mediating concept (e.g., tiger). The lexical decision results yielded facilitation of directly related priming conditions (e.g., lion-tiger and tiger-stripes); however, the mediated condition (e.g., lion-stripes) did not facilitate performance compared to either a neutral prime or an unrelated prime condition. In contrast, the pronunciation results yielded facilitation of both directly related and mediated priming conditions. The results were viewed as supporting the notion that activation spreads beyond directly related concepts in semantic memory. It is suggested that characteristics of the lexical decision task masked the appearance of a mediated priming effect. Implications of an automatic spread of activation beyond directly related concepts are discussed."

The method uses circular convolution to associate items, which are represented by vectors. Arbitrary variable bindings, short sequences of various lengths, simple frame-like structures, and reduced representations can be represented in a fixed width vector. These representations are items in their own right and can be used in constructing compositional structures. The noisy reconstructions extracted from convolution memories can be cleaned up by using a separate associative memory that has good reconstructive properties."

Poggio (1973, Kybernetik, 122, 113-122), and TODAM2 is a revised version which includes context, auto-associations for binding, a dual basis for item information, and mediators for associative information. It can explain some complex interactions (differential forgetting and differential attention) between item and associative information. In this paper we derive the basic expressions for the memory-probe dot product for the 2x2 cases (item and pair study crossed with item and pair probe), and then we apply these expressions to judgments of frequency (JOF) and judgments of recency (JOR). We report an experiment which tests both JOF and JOR for single items with post-cuing to control for encoding strategies and suggest an attenuation factor for repetition to improve the fits. With attenuation, TODAM2 can fit the JOR data, but the JOF fits, while not too bad, consistently predict too much dependence between item and associative information. Copyright 2001 Academic Press."

It is argued that an adequate characterization of \u2018what we know\u2019 requires that we posit abstract mental structures to which we do not have conscious access and which are essentially conceptual and propositional, rather than sensory or pictorial, in nature. Such representations are more accurately referred to as symbolic descriptions than as images in the usual sense. Implications of using an imagery vocabulary are examined, and it is argued that the picture metaphor underlying recent theoretical discussions is seriously misleading \u2014 especially as it suggests that the image is an entity to be perceived. The relative merits of several alternative modes of representation (propositions, data structures, and procedures) are discussed. The final section is a more speculative discussion of the nature of the representation which may be involved when people \u2018use\u2019 visual images."

The nature of the control word--namely, whether it matched the frequency of the ambiguous word's overall word form or its contextually instantiated word meaning (a higher or lower frequency word, respectively)--was examined. In addition, contexts that were singularly supportive of the ambiguous word's subordinate meaning were used. Eye movements were recorded as participants read contextually biasing passages that contained an ambiguous word target or a word-form or word-meaning control. A comparison of fixation times on the 2 control words revealed a significant effect of word frequency. Fixation times on the ambiguous word generally fell between those on the 2 controls and were significantly different than both. Results are discussed in relation to the reordered access model, in which both meaning frequency and prior context affect access procedures."

Words had been learned as part of a basal reader program or as part of outside reading. Word recognition speed and reading accuracy were examined for abstract and concrete words using lexical decision and word naming tasks. The size of the concreteness effect was similar for both processing tasks. In neither task did concreteness influence reaction times, but abstract words were read with less accuracy than concrete words in both tasks. Further, these concreteness effects in reading accuracy were larger for words that were part of a basal reading program than for words acquired during free reading. We conclude that word meaning influences the entry of words at a time when children are developing a sizeable reading vocabulary."

An example of a high-constraint stem is \u201cAfter the accident he was covered in . . . ,\u201d and an example of a low-constraint stem is \u201cOn the corner of the table there was a bit of . . . ,\u201d with glass and blood being legal completion words for either stem. Whittlesea normed these stimuli by having subjects rate whether the completion was predictable from the stem; the norming data are of interest here. Subjects rated the completion words as more predictable from the high-constraint stems (.81) than from the low-constraint stems (.27).

Specifically, he used 10 high- and 10 low-expectation stems (see his Appendix A) with different terminal words. The subject\u2019s task was to read the stem and press a button to reveal the completion word, reading it aloud as quickly as possible. Pronunciation latencies were faster to completion words preceded by a high-constraint stem (661 ms; e.g., Stem 2) than by a low-constraint stem (735 ms; e.g., Stem 1). In BEAGLE, the context and order information for the same stems was computed for the terminal position, and the two types of information were summed into a composite probe vector. The cosine was computed between the probe vector and the lexical vector for the terminal word for each stimulus. The model predicts Whittlesea\u2019s (1993) finding of greater congruency between stem and completion if the context is semantically more predictive. Specifically, high-expectation stem and completions had significantly higher cosines (M $ .3517) than did low-expectation stem and completions (M $ .2666), F(1, 18) $ 6.30, p , .05. In a related study, Whittlesea (2002) used a larger stimulus set (see his appendix) that varied stem constraint while using the same completion words."

                "text": "Differences in characteristics of language development that have been identified in a number of recent studies are reviewed. In these studies, some children have been found to emphasize single words, simple productive rules for combining words, nouns and noun phrases, and referential functions; others use whole phrases and formulas, pronouns, compressed sentences, and expressive or social functions. The evidence for two styles of acquisition and their continuity over time is examined. Explanations in terms of hemispheric functions, cognitive maturation, cognitive style, and environmental context are considered, and an explanation in terms of the interaction of individual and environment in different functional contexts is suggested. Implications for development and the mastery of complex systems are discussed. A new consensus is emerging about the appropriate framework within which to view the important problems of language acquisition. In contrast to the prevailing view a decade ago that language development could only be understood within a linguistic, genetic, rule-testing, individual framework, students of child language today have increasingly accepted the premise of a developing social, cognitive, and communicative system within which language is gradually mastered. The implications o f this shift for our view of both language and development are important, as the burgeoning literature in the journals and in such recent edited collections a s Collins (1979), K . E . Nelson (1978, 1980), and Lock (1978) indicate. A sense o f the richness and interest o f the newer approaches can be gleaned from these sources. Here I would like to consider how the study of individual differences in development fits into this new framework and adds to it. Research reported in this article was supported in part by a grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York. I would like to thank Ellen Tanouye for her valuable contribution to data collection and transcription and"

The probe item evokes the search set on the basis of probe-memory item relatedness, just as a ringing tuning fork evokes sympathetic vibrations in other tuning forks. Evidence is accumulated in parallel from each probe-memory item comparison, and each comparison is modeled by a continuous random walk process. In item recognition, the decision process is self-terminating on matching comparisons and exhaustive on nonmatching comparisons. The mathematical model produces predictions about accuracy, mean reaction time, error latency, and reaction time distributions that are in good accord with experimental data. The theory is applied to four item recognition paradigms (Sternberg, prememorized list, study-test, and continuous) and to speed-accuracy paradigms; results are found to provide a basis for comparison of these paradigms. It is noted that neural network models can be interfaced to the retrieval theory with little difficulty and that semantic memory models may benefit from such a retrieval scheme."

We show that they have a small-world structure, characterized by sparse connectivity, short average path lengths between words, and strong local clustering. In addition, the distributions of the number of connections follow power laws that indicate a scale-free pattern of connectivity, with most nodes having relatively few connections joined together through a small number of hubs with many connections. These regularities have also been found in certain other complex natural networks, such as the World Wide Web, but they are not consistent with many conventional models of semantic organization, based on inheritance hierarchies, arbitrarily structured networks, or high-dimensional vector spaces. We propose that these structures reflect the mechanisms by which semantic networks grow. We describe a simple model for semantic growth, in which each new word or concept is connected to an existing network by differentiating the connectivity pattern of an existing node. This model generates appropriate small-world statistics and power-law connectivity distributions, and it also suggests one possible mechanistic basis for the effects of learning history variables (age of acquisition, usage frequency) on behavioral performance in semantic processing tasks."

An accidental inversion of words or letters or sounds can produce grotesque alterations of a sentence, and to scramble the elements at random is to turn a sensible message into gibberish. No attack upon the problems of verbal behavior will be satisfactory if it does not take quantitative account of the patterns of verbal elements. We can dependably produce and distinguish only a small number of different letters or speech sounds. We must use these few elements to talk about millions of different things and situations. To stretch these few elements to cover these many needs, we are forced to combine the elements into patterns and to assign a different significance to each pattern. Since the number of possible patterns increases exponentially as the length of the pattern increases, this proves to be an efficient method of solving the problem."

                "text": "1 But if the knowledge which we acquired before birth was lost by us at birth, and afterwards by the use of the senses we recovered that which we previously knew, will not that which we call learning be a process of recovering our knowledge, and may not this be rightly termed recollection?-Plato, Phaedo (c.a. 412BCE) One way to think about infants before they acquire their native tongue is as second-language (or reincarnated) learners whose task is only to find out how priorly known concepts, at the level of both words and sentences, are mapped onto linguistic forms. Life for these Platonic infants would be much easier than that faced by Quine's linguist, trapped in an exotic land where not only pronunciations but, simultaneously, the modes of thought, may be different from one's own. We ask here which of these models is closer to the real case, concentrating attention on the task of acquiring a first lexicon. The test bed for this question as raised in this chapter concerns the changing character of child vocabularies in the first three years of life. Specifically, the first vocabulary (the first 100 words or so), in various languages and under marvelously varying child-rearing conditions, massively over-represents the noun lexical class, compared to its frequency in the input corpus, and massively under-represents the verbs. A second widely observed property is that those verbs that do appear at the earliest stages of child speech and comprehension are largely limited to action terms such as go, run, and throw even though verbs like think and look are frequent in maternal speech. What accounts for such input-output disparities? Speaking very broadly, we can distinguish two general kinds of explanations for these systematic asynchronies in aspects of vocabulary development. The first of these emphasizes children's cognitive development. The alternative, which we will try to defend in this chapter, emphasizes linguistic development. The burden in maintaining this latter stance is to understand why, all the same, the abstract words are manifestly harder to acquire than the concrete ones. Plausibly enough, the changing character of vocabularies over developmental time is usually taken to reflect the changing character of the child's conceptual life. This kind of hypothesis comes in two main flavors, depending on whether the causal machinery for cognitive change is taken to be maturational or experiential. But in either case, the changes in the function over time are assigned \u2026"

In spite of its ability to predict wide ranging aspects of intellectual activity, a detailed account of how people carry out memory tasks eludes current theory. In the free-recall version of the task, subjects are asked to study a list of items and then to report as many as possible in any order. Performance in the task is usually reported by tallying accuracy as a function of the position in which each item appeared in the study list, the so-called serial-position curve. We present representation, encoding, and retrieval equations that specify a stochastic model of the processing that people carry out when performing the task. One archival source lists data for undergraduate subjects with 80 trials per subject. We obtained excellent fits when we applied the encoding and retrieval equations to the archival serial-position data. In addition, we compared the model\u2019s behaviour against the archival data on three additional measures: the order in which items are reported, the number of items reported correctly per trial, and the frequency of unstudied items reported in error. The model correctly anticipated the new measures without a change in its parameters, i.e., the new measures were obtained for free."

According to spreading activation theories, the amount of activation that spreads between a prime and a target should be a function of the number of mediating links between the prime and target in a semantic network and the strengths of those links. The amount of activation should determine the amount of facilitation given by a prime to a target in lexical decision. To predict the amount of facilitation, it is necessary to measure the associative links between prime and target in memory. Free-association production probability has been the variable chosen in previous research for this measurement. However, in 3 experiments, the authors show priming effects that free-association production probabilities cannot easily predict. Instead, they argue that amount of priming depends on the familiarity of the prime and target as a compound, where the compound is formed by the simultaneous presence of the prime and target in short-term memory as a test item."

Priming did not vary substantially with differences in variables that affect automatic versus strategic processing, such as time spent processing the prime and target, relationship proportion, and task (except that average effects were smaller in the naming task). Although category coordinates were investigated in the majority of studies, synonyms, antonyms, and script relations also demonstrated priming; functional relations showed greater priming, and essential and perceptual relations showed less. The average effect size for semantic priming was smaller than that for associative priming, suggesting that there is an \u201cassociative boost\u201d from adding an associative relationship to a semantic one. The implications of these findings for the modularity thesis and for models of semantic priming are discussed."

In Experiment 1, decreasing the proportion of congruent test words had no effect on either the facilitation for highly likely words or the inhibition for incongruent words; increasing the proportion of predictable words produced no increase in facilitation for these words, but did increase the inhibition for incongruous words. In Experiment 2, contexts with very high or very low degrees of constraint produced equivalent results when predictability was uniformly low: no facilitation for unlikely but congruent words, and inhibition for incongruent words. In general, the patterns of change in facilitation and inhibition caused by changes in the contextual environment were more consistent with the modified two-process model (Stanovich & West, 1983) than with the verification model (Becker, 1982). But the limited range of influence suggests that, under conditions approximating normal reading, little use is made of such \u201cmetacontextual\u201d information."

Accuracy on a set of 80 retired items was originally used by Landauer and Dumais (1997) as the criterion for dimensionality selection in LSA, and the TOEFL has since become a benchmark for measuring performance of semantic models.

Nonetheless, comparing performance and target\u2013alternative cosines between the models is a good start to establish correspondence. We used the same 80 TOEFL items originally used by Landauer and Dumais (1997).(13) Both LSA and BEAGLE were trained on the same TASA corpus. All comparisons with LSA were in term space with 300 dimensions\u2014this dimensionality is roughly optimal for performance on the TOEFL items. For BEAGLE, we used the standard 2,048-dimensional vectors. For each item, the alternative with the highest cosine to the target was selected as the response. If either the target or correct alternative was unknown, a score of .25 was assigned for the item (essentially a guess). LSA correctly answered 55.31% of the items. Trained on only context information, BEAGLE was in close correspondence, correctly answering 55.60% of the items. Trained on both context and order information, BEAGLE did slightly better, correctly answering 57.81% of the items. We computed Pearson correlation coefficients between all 320 target\u2013alternative cosines for LSA, context-only BEAGLE, and composite BEAGLE. Considering their differences in both learning mechanisms and context (paragraph for LSA and sentence for BEAGLE), LSA and context-only BEAGLE were quite similar in their pairwise word similarities, r(297) .662, p .001. The pairwise word similarities between LSA and the composite BEAGLE were also positively correlated, although less so, r(297) .527, p .001 (note: df N 2 pairwise missing items). We tested the difference between these correlations with E. J. Williams\u2019s (1959) ratio for nonindependent correlations (see also Steiger, 1980)."

Given a corpus of strings (such as text, transcribed speech, chromosome or protein sequence data, sheet music, etc.), our unsupervised algorithm recursively distills from it hierarchically structured patterns. The adios (automatic distillation of structure) algorithm relies on a statistical method for pattern extraction and on structured generalization, two processes that have been implicated in language acquisition. It has been evaluated on artificial context-free grammars with thousands of rules, on natural languages as diverse as English and Chinese, and on protein data correlating sequence with function. This unsupervised algorithm is capable of learning complex syntax, generating grammatical novel sentences, and proving useful in other fields that call for structure discovery from raw data, such as bioinformatics."

                "text": "We explore a network architecture introduced by Elman (1990) for predicting successive elements of a sequence. The network uses the pattern of activation over a set of hidden units from time-step t-1, together with element t, to predict element t + 1. When the network is trained with strings from a particular finite-state grammar, it can learn to be a perfect finite-state recognizer for the grammar. When the net has a minimal number of hidden units, patterns on the hidden units come to correspond to the nodes of the grammar; however, this correspondence is not necessary for the network to act as a perfect finite-state recognizer. Next, we provide a detailed analysis of how the network acquires its internal representations. We show that the network progressively encodes more and more temporal context by means of a probability analysis. Finally, we explore the conditions under which the network can carry information about distant sequential contingencies across intervening elements to distant elements. Such information is maintained with relative ease if it is relevant at each intermediate step; it tends to be lost when intervening elements do not depend on it. At first glance this may suggest that such networks are not relevant to natural language, in which dependencies may span indefinite distances. However, embeddings in natural language are not completely independent of earlier information. The final simulation shows that long distance sequential contingencies can be encoded by the network even if only subtle statistical properties of embedded strings depend on the early information. The network encodes long-distance dependencies by shading internal representations that are responsible for processing common embeddings in otherwise different sequences. This ability to represent simultaneously similarities and differences between several sequences relies on the graded nature of representations used by the network, which contrast with the finite states of traditional automata. For this reason, the network and other similar architectures may be called Graded State Machines."

These same mechanisms allow the model to retrieve word transition information stored in its lexicon. The major difference between the representations learned by BEAGLE and those learned by LSA is that BEAGLE includes a consideration of order information in addition to context information. The hyperspace analogue to language (HAL; Burgess & Lund, 2000; Lund & Burgess, 1996) does measure distance (in word steps) in a moving window as it learns but does not explicitly encode order information, nor does it have a mechanism to retrieve sequential dependencies. For the priming data presented in this article, for example, neither LSA nor HAL predicts the pattern of priming found in the human data; whereas HAL underestimates the magnitude of associative priming, LSA overestimates associative priming and underestimates semantic priming. In addition, HAL is unable to predict mediated similarity (Livesay & Burgess, 1998). This incongruence is also found in a variety of other priming data (see Jones et al., 2006). Priming is an example of behavior that depends on both semantic and associative information, and only a representation that considers both types of information can correctly simulate the aggregate human data. BEAGLE represents both context and order information in a composite representation, giving it a higher fidelity representation of word meaning. As a by-product of using convolution as an order-encoding mechanism, the model can invert the routine and retrieve word transitions from the same representations. Thus, it is a model of both word meaning and sequential dependency information without requiring additional storage or assumptions. Note, however, that convolution\u2013correlation is a primitive model of sequential dependency: Its virtue is that it demonstrates that learned positional information may be retrieved from semantic memory, and for that reason, BEAGLE takes a small step toward an empiricist theory of language. Although BEAGLE cannot currently replace generative models of language, it suggests a reduced role for rule-based processing. More recent co-occurrence models use Bayesian methods to consider how often words appear together in contexts and apart (e.g., Griffiths & Steyvers, 2002; Griffiths, Steyvers, & Tenenbaum, 2005; Hoffman, 2001; A. E. Smith & Humphreys, 2006; Steyvers & Griffiths, in press). Specifically, topic models (e.g., Griffiths, Steyvers, & Tenenbaum, 2005) use probabilistic methods to infer the generative topics from which documents were created. The idea is that a document is a mixture of generative topics, where a topic is a probability distribution over words. Griffiths, Steyvers, Blei, and Tenenbaum (2005) have integrated the generative processes from a probabilistic topic model and a hidden Markov model to fuse a model of meaning with one of sequential dependencies."

The theory applies to both recognition and recall and covers both accuracy and latency. Noise in the decision stage necessitates a two-criterion decision system, and over time the criteria converge until a decision is reached. Performance is predicted from the moments (expectation and variance) of the similarity distributions, and these can be derived from the theory.

The goal of the present research was to localize mediated priming by assessing two-step priming effects on N400 and reaction times (RT). We propose that the N400 priming effect mainly reflects integration processes but, in contrast with RT, does not reflect spreading activation. The results show that RT and N400 effects can dissociate. In a standard lexical decision task, we found mediated priming for N400 but not for RT. When a lexical decision to both the prime and the target was required, mediated priming was observed for both measures, but the RT effect was not influenced by list composition, whereas the N400 effect was. We conclude that two qualitatively different processes underlie the two types of mediated priming. A process of \u201cglobal integration\u201d yields an N400 effect, whereas an RT effect is evoked by spreading activation. \u00a9 2000 Academic Press"

In Experiment 2, order memory was better for concrete than for abstract items. And in Experiment 3, order memory was better when the same six items were presented on every trial than when a unique set of six items was presented. In all conditions in all experiments, the to-be-remembered items were given to the subject at test.

These same mechanisms allow the model to retrieve word transition information stored in its lexicon. The major difference between the representations learned by BEAGLE and those learned by LSA is that BEAGLE includes a consideration of order information in addition to context information. The hyperspace analogue to language (HAL; Burgess & Lund, 2000; Lund & Burgess, 1996) does measure distance (in word steps) in a moving window as it learns but does not explicitly encode order information, nor does it have a mechanism to retrieve sequential dependencies. For the priming data presented in this article, for example, neither LSA nor HAL predicts the pattern of priming found in the human data; whereas HAL underestimates the magnitude of associative priming, LSA overestimates associative priming and underestimates semantic priming. In addition, HAL is unable to predict mediated similarity (Livesay & Burgess, 1998). This incongruence is also found in a variety of other priming data (see Jones et al., 2006). Priming is an example of behavior that depends on both semantic and associative information, and only a representation that considers both types of information can correctly simulate the aggregate human data. BEAGLE represents both context and order information in a composite representation, giving it a higher fidelity representation of word meaning. As a by-product of using convolution as an order-encoding mechanism, the model can invert the routine and retrieve word transitions from the same representations. Thus, it is a model of both word meaning and sequential dependency information without requiring additional storage or assumptions. Note, however, that convolution\u2013correlation is a primitive model of sequential dependency: Its virtue is that it demonstrates that learned positional information may be retrieved from semantic memory, and for that reason, BEAGLE takes a small step toward an empiricist theory of language. Although BEAGLE cannot currently replace generative models of language, it suggests a reduced role for rule-based processing. More recent co-occurrence models use Bayesian methods to consider how often words appear together in contexts and apart (e.g., Griffiths & Steyvers, 2002; Griffiths, Steyvers, & Tenenbaum, 2005; Hoffman, 2001; A. E. Smith & Humphreys, 2006; Steyvers & Griffiths, in press). Specifically, topic models (e.g., Griffiths, Steyvers, & Tenenbaum, 2005) use probabilistic methods to infer the generative topics from which documents were created. The idea is that a document is a mixture of generative topics, where a topic is a probability distribution over words. Griffiths, Steyvers, Blei, and Tenenbaum (2005) have integrated the generative processes from a probabilistic topic model and a hidden Markov model to fuse a model of meaning with one of sequential dependencies."

In general, we found that the event name itself combined most readily with superordinate noun categories; thus, one gets dressed with clothes and needs various kitchen utensils to make breakfast. When such activities were analyzed into their script elements, the basic level appeared as the level of abstraction of objects necessary to script the events; e.g., in getting dressed, one puts on pants, sweater, and shoes, and in making breakfast, one cooks eggs in a frying pan. With respect to prototypes, it appears to be those category members judged the more prototypical that have attributes that enable them to fit into the typical and agreed upon script elements. We are presently collecting normative data on the intersection of common events, the objects associated with those events and the other sets of events associated with those objects.2 In addition, object names for eliciting events are varied in level of abstraction and in known prototypicality in given categories. Initial results show a similar pattern to that obtained in the earlier research in which it was found that the more typical members of superordinate categories could replace the superordinate in sentence frames generated by subjects told to \"make up a sentence\" that used the superordinate (Rosch, 1977). That is, the task of using a given concrete noun in a sentence appears to be an indirect method of eliciting a statement about the events in which objects play a part; that indirect method showed clearly that prototypical category members are those that can play the role in events expected of members of that category. The use of deviant forms of object names in narratives accounts for several recently explored effects in the psychological literature. Substituting object names at other than the basic level within scripts results in obviously deviant descriptions. Substitution of superordinates produces just those types of narrative that Bransford and Johnson (1973) have claimed are not comprehended; for example, \" The procedure is actually quite simple. First you arrange things into different groups. Of course, one pile may be sufficient [p. 400].\" It should be noted in the present context that what Bransford and Johnson call context cues are actually names of basic-level events (e.g., washing clothes) and that one function of hearing the event name is to enable the reader to translate the superordinate terms into basic-level objects and actions. Such a translation appears to be a necessary aspect of our ability to match linguistic descriptions to world knowledge in a way that produces the \"click of comprehension.\" On the other hand, substitution of subordinate terms for basic-level object names in scripts gives the effect of satire or snobbery. For example, a review ( Garis, 1975) of a pretentious novel accused of actually being about nothing more than brand-name snobbery concludes, \"And so, after putting away my 10"

These tools include ways to test competing models and ways to track very large language databases. The former aid the field's ability to demonstrate theoretical progress, and the latter can perform computations beyond what a human expert could do in a lifetime. There is a difference between tools and theory, however, and in this article, I point out some of the ways in which large dimensional space methods such as Latent Semantic Analysis and Hyperspace Analog to Language fall short of being plausible theories about psychological reality. I examine in\u2010principle failures and wrong\u2010kind failures that arise in the systems and point out the limitations of systems based exclusively on co\u2010occurrence."

In both studies, the letters were presented in a fixed position, that is, on, or slightly above, the fixation point, and the exposure duration was set to limit performance to 50010 correct. Unfortunately, however, at present the value of both matrices is questionable. Mewhort and Dow (1979) studied Gilmore et a1. 's results and procedure thoroughly and came up with three rather problematic points. First, they convincingly argue that the exposure times used to limit performance to 50010 correct are remarkably long (the range was 10 to 70 msec, and the mean over subjects was 33 msec), Second, they show that, for the main diagonal entries, there is a remarkably high correlation (.873) between the number of dots in a letter and accuracy of identification. Third, they mention an extremely low correlation (.212) between the main diagonal entries of the matrices reported by Gilmore et al. and Townsend. These three facts are sufficient to give rise to serious doubts about the validity of Gilmore et a1. 's matrix. Furthermore, the type font Gilmore et al. used (see their Figure 1) was rather different from the type font we planned to use (see our Figure 1). In a reply, Gilmore and Hersh (1979) state that to achieve the 50% accuracy level, they used a lo~ intensity level, which resulted in long exposure durations. They explain the high correlation between identification accuracy and number of dots in a let-"

In this paper I attempt to clarify the disagreements by focusing on the alleged spatial nature of images and on recent findings concerned with \u201crotation\u201d and \u201cscanning\u201d of mental images. It is argued that the main point of disagreement concerns whether certain aspects of the way in which images are transformed should be attributed to intrinsic knowledge-independent properties of the medium in which images are instantiated or the mechanisms by which they are processed, or whether images are typically transformed in certain ways because subjects take their task to be the simulation of the act of witnessing certain real events taking place and therefore use their tacit knowledge of the imaged situation to cause the transformation to proceed as they believe it would have proceeded in reality. The fundamental difference between these t o modes of processing is examined, and certain general difficulties inherent in the analogue account are discussed. It is argued that the tacit knowledge a count is more plausible, at least in the cases examined, because it is a more general account and also because certain empirical results demonstrate that both \u201cmental scanning\u201d and \u201cmental rotation\u201d transformations can be critically influenced by varying the instructions given to subjects and the precise form of the task used and that the form of the influence is explainable in terms of the semantic content of subjects' beliefs and goals\u2014that is, that these operations are cognitively penetrable by subjects' beliefs and goals. Functions that are cognitively penetrable in this sense, it is argued, must be explained, at least in part, by reference to computational cognitive processes whose behavior is governed by goals, beliefs, and tacit knowledge rather than by properties of analogue mechanism."

In contrast to the latter method which stems from linear algebra and performs a Singular Value Decomposition of co-occurrence tables, the proposed technique uses a generative latent class model to perform a probabilistic mixture decomposition. This results in a more principled approach with a solid foundation in statistical inference. More precisely, we propose to make use of a temperature controlled version of the Expectation Maximization algorithm for model fitting, which has shown excellent performance in practice. Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis has many applications, most prominently in information retrieval, natural language processing, machine learning from text, and in related areas. The paper presents perplexity results for different types of text and linguistic data collections and discusses an application in automated document indexing. The experiments indicate substantial and consistent improvements of the probabilistic method over standard Latent Semantic Analysis."

One occurs when the context has been seen previously; the other occurs when the context is new in the test. Both appear to result from the construction of expectations and evaluation of outcomes, but the former appears to depend on the formation of definite expectations, whereas the latter appears to depend on indefinite expectations. These 2 routes to remembering are affected by different factors and cause dissociated patterns of remembering.

Although prior experience of a stimulus can produce a feeling of familiarity, that feeling can also be aroused in the absence of prior experience if perceptual processing of the stimulus is fluent (e.g., Whittlesea, Jacoby, & Girard, 1990). This suggests that feelings of familiarity arise through an unconscious inference about the source of processing fluency. The present experiments extend that conclusion. First, they show that a wide variety of feelings about the past are controlled by a fluency heuristic, including feelings about the meaning, pleasantness, duration, and recency of past events. Second, they demonstrate that the attribution process does not rely only on perceptual fluency, but can be influenced even more by the fluency of conceptual processing. Third, they show that although the fluency heuristic itself is simple, people's use of it is highly sophisticated and makes them robustly sensitive to the actual historical status of current events"

Several necessary conditions that must be satisfied by these probability assignment techniques if they are to be consistant are presented. The problem of recognizing languages is also considered.

The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents (\u201csemantic structure\u201d) in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising."

The algorithm, called PMI-IR, uses Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) and Information Retrieval (IR) to measure the similarity of pairs of words. PMI-IR is empirically evaluated using 80 synonym test questions from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and 50 synonym test questions from a collection of tests for students of English as a Second Language (ESL). On both tests, the algorithm obtains a score of 74%. PMI-IR is contrasted with Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), which achieves a score of 64% on the same 80 TOEFL questions. The paper discusses potential applications of the new unsupervised learning algorithm and some implications of the results for LSA and LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing)."

An attempt is made in the present study to identify those automatic procedures which appear most effective as a replacement for the missing language analysis.\nA series of computer experiments is described, designed to simulate a conventional document retrieval environment. It is found that a simple duplication, by automatic means, of the standard, manual document indexing and retrieval operations will not produce acceptable output results. New mechanized approaches to document handling are proposed, including document ranking methods, automatic dictionary and word list generation, and user feedback searches. It is shown that the fully automatic methodology is superior in effectiveness to the conventional procedures in normal use."

                "text": "The Cognitive Science Programme at Carleton University Andrew Brook, Carleton University Carleton University in Ottawa offers free-standing, fully-integrated Cognitive Science programmes at both the undergraduate and the doctoral level. The undergraduate programme was recently reviewed by two senior Canadian cognitive researchers. Some of their findings and recommendations might be of interest to other cognitive science educators. In this presentation, I will describe some of the strengths and weaknesses of both our programmes, summarize some of the key findings and recommendations about the undergraduate programme, and discuss the implications of the latter. The Three Cultures of Cognitive Science Nils Dahlback, Link\u00f6ping University When designing an educational program for cognitive science, it is important to base this on some coherent view of the field. If not, there is a risk that the students are presented with a haphazard selection of courses that is more a reflection of the interests of the current available faculty than anything else. Lacking an integrative framework, it will be difficult for the students to relate the different topics and perspectives presented to each other, and it will be difficult for prospective employers in both industry and academia to know which competence the students bring with them. In this talk, an alternative view of cognitive science as neither one unified cognitive science nor just a multidisciplinary field of a number of sciences (psychology, AI, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, etc.) is presented. It is argued that cognitive science is best described as a matrix of two dimensions, a content or domain dimension (e.g., language, problem solving etc., and subsets of these) and a methods dimension, comprising three basic approaches to research: empirical, formal, and model building. The latter are seen not only as methods per se, but rather as scientific \u2018cultures,\u2019 carriers of differing explicit and implicit views of what constitutes \u2018good research.\u2019 Since cultural knowledge to a large extent can be acquired only by \u2018living\u2019 in the culture, the Link\u00f6ping Cognitive Science Master's program is built on the assumption that the students should early in their studies learn all three scientific traditions, both the theoretical and methodological aspects, on an equal footing, before specializing in a particular sub-field. The talk presents the \u2018three cultures\u2019 view of cognitive science, how this has influenced the general design of the program, and describes theoretical and applied courses which illustrate our approach to supporting the students acquiring their own perspective of a multicultural but still unified field of cognitive science. Using Project Work in Teaching Cognitive Science Randy Jones, Colby College In recent years I have developed and taught introductory undergraduate courses in cognitive science and artificial intelligence, as well as one graduate-level course on cognitive science. In developing my courses, I have strongly subscribed to a proposition that I assume most of us (as teachers and cognitive scientists) believe: an effective form of education requires students to participate actively in constructive projects that exercise the material they are learning in class. This presentation describes a set of class projects I have developed, in the hopes that others will find them useful in teaching courses on cognitive science. Some of the projects are directly applicable to a cognitive science course. Others I have developed for a course on artificial intelligence, but would also be appropriate for cognitive science, depending on the emphasis of the course. Among other topics, the projects include study of knowledge representation, learning, production systems, cognitive modeling, and interactive systems. Project descriptions and executable code are available on-line at http://www.cs.colby.edu/~rjones/courses/cs397/projects/ and http://www.cs.colby.edu/~rjones/courses/cs353/projects/. Teaching Multiple Disciplinary Perspectives: A First Year Course in Cognitive Science Keith Stenning, University of Edinburgh First year Edinburgh undergraduate students arrive knowing little of AI, computer science, linguistics, logic, philosophy, psychology \u2013 the component disciplines of cognitive science. They don't even know whether these component disciplines are of interest to them. For the last four years we have been teaching a half-year course on Human Communication which is designed to give students from all departments in the university a grasp of what cognitive science is, and how the component disciplines contribute to it. This talk will describe some of our experiences. Are we best teaching single disciplines first, and integrating only after? Or is it better to start by treating disciplines as merely perspectives on a common subject matter? Cognitive Science Education at Penn and the Undergraduate Summer Workshop John C. Trueswell In this talk, I will try to convey the flavor of cognitive science education from the perspective of the group at the University of Pennsylvania. Over the years, Penn has maintained a loose federation approach to cognitive science, in the sense that the departments that make up the participating subdisciplines of cognitive science have used the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science (IRCS) as a gathering place and intellectual-exchange center, but also as a catalyst for interdisciplinary course offerings at the undergraduate and graduate level. I'll discuss the pros and cons of such an educational system, and emphasize how it leaves open the definition of cognitive science, recognizing the current dynamics of the field. As an illustration of this, I will focus on a r ecent educ ational initiative stemming from IRCS: The Undergraduate Summer Workshop in Cognitive Science and Cognitive Neuroscience. Each year, IRCS brings together a select group of undergraduate students from around the world who are interested in pursuing graduate work within some area of cognitive science or cognitive neuroscience. The workshop provides students with an intense two-week introduction to Penn's perspective on these emerging disciplines. Penn faculty offer day-long seminars and labs in their area of specialization, permitting in depth discussion of a particular research topic. Each week ends with a panel discussion by the faculty, relating the topics of that week, and providing spontaneous discussion of where the field of cognitive science might be headed in the coming years. By acknowledging and educating students that cognitive science is still an ill-defined rapidly changing field, we stimulate students to learn more about cognitive science, and entice them to contribute to its development and definition.

Similarly, Simon (1996) reminded cognitive theorists not to build complexity into a model\u2019s algorithms when the behavior can be understood in terms of a simple organism responding to redundancies in a complex environment. Discussing the path taken by an ant on a beach, Simon noted that the ant\u2019s path is \u201cirregular, complex, hard to describe. But the complexity is really a complexity in the surface of the beach, not a complexity in the ant\u201d (Simon, 1996, p. 51). The work presented here reiterates Simon\u2019s (1996) advice in the domain of knowledge representation, reminding theorists not to build unnecessary complexity into either the representation or processing mechanisms when it can be more easily explained from the structure learned by a simple mechanism applied to statistical redundancies in a complex language environment."

Gibson (1966) warned perceptual theorists not to postulate computational mechanisms for the perceptual system when the necessary information for perception could be obtained from the environment via the sensory system."

For example, an experimenter may wish to assess whether two predictors correlate equally with a criterion variable. In another situation, the experimenter may wish to test the hypothesis that an entire matrix of correlations has remained stable over time. The present article reviews the literature on such tests, points out some statistics that should be avoided, and presents a variety of techniques that can be used safely with medium to large samples. Several illustrative numerical examples are provided."

The correlation between LSA and context-only BEAGLE was significantly larger than the correlation between LSA and composite BEAGLE, t(296) 5.44, p .001. The context information in BEAGLE reasonably resembles the information in the LSA vectors (in terms of TOEFL cosines). The addition of order information makes the BEAGLE representation less similar to the LSA representation than does context information alone. However, the composite representation performed slightly better on the TOEFL, whereas its similarity to LSA decreased, relative to the context-only representation. In addition to providing a model of sequential dependency, adding order information to BEAGLE may improve the fidelity of semantic representation. Because of the limited number of comparisons in the TOEFL test, we conducted a much larger comparison between models using a database constructed by Maki, McKinley, and Thompson (2004). Maki et al."

Generally, concrete words (e.g., dog) are easier to process and recall than are abstract words (e.g., justice). In addition, concrete words normally have an earlier age of acquisition than do abstract words (McFalls, Schwanenflugel, & Stahl, 1996). Paivio\u2019s (1971, 1986) dual-coding theory proposes that words representing concrete objects can be encoded using both verbal and visual codes (e.g., the word dog and an image of a dog), whereas abstract words have no visual code (see Pylyshyn, 1973, 1981, for criticisms of Paivio\u2019s theory). In BEAGLE, concrete and abstract words can become similar to other members of their class from indirect information. Figure 12 shows the time course of group cohesion development in the lexicon for abstract and concrete words (80 words per group; sentences were sampled in random order). The abstract and concrete words used in this simulation were taken from Paivio, Yuille, and Madigan (1968); they were balanced for frequency, length, and age of acquisition, but the concrete words had a higher mean imageability rating and concreteness rating than did the abstract words (see Neath, 1998, Appendix Table I)."
