The results obtained in the previous experiment were replicated despite a change from fixed to varied targets, and from spatial to temporal separation of the targets, thus extending their generality. The modified conjunction-matching model proposes that the subject progressively narrows his focus of attention, first to deal with a single display stimulus at a time and finally, if necessary, to a single target. The model was tested quantitatively by simulating the separate stages hypothesized to underlie conjunction-matching in some simpler, single-attribute-matching conditions, and using the differences between latencies in these conditions to predict differences between latencies in the appropriate conjunction-matching conditions. The results were consistent with the general hypothesis that one important role of focused attention and serial processing is to integrate separable attributes or features into the correct conjunctions, which correspond to the objects actually presented or stored."

For visual displays of letters of the alphabet the time required to ignore a symbol as irrelevant is shown to depend upon the vocabulary of items for which search is conducted. Incidental learning of irrelevant symbols is shown to be related to the same variable. It is shown that performance in situations of this type is analogous to that in which subjects respond to groups of stimuli rather than to particular items, and stimulus and response entropy are independently varied."

For all three performance measures used, frequency of correct detections and correct and error latencies, strong interactions were obtained between all of the other variables and signal-noise confusability. The functions obtained, together with other data bearing on the role of confusions and on spatial relations among characters within the display, suggest a model whose initial phase is a parallel feature extraction process involving inhibitory relations among input channels."

The principal findings were: (1) identification reaction times (RTs) were faster than categorization RTs: (2) RTs for targets shown without a context were faster than RTs for targets shown in the context of other stimuli; (3) identification RTs for targets shown in the context of stimuli from a different conceptual-taxonomic category were faster than RTs for targets shown in the context of stimuli from the same category only when target-context stimulus discriminability differencet were optimized.

The objective features of the target must have been the same here, whether search was within or between categories; but, as Gleitman and Jonides (1976) point out, subjects could have adopted different strategies in the two conditions. The present analysis suggests that subjects may have used a single feature for the between-category condition (e.g., symmetry for oh in digits), and a conjunction of features (e.g., closed and curved) for the within-category conditions. White (1977) has shown that the category effect disappears when digits and letters are typed in a number of different type-faces, so that their physical features are less consistent and offer less reliable cues to discriminate the categories."

The latencies of letter matching for the novel and familiar letters did not differ when Ss were expecting the particular letters which were presented. However, latencies to the two types of letters differed significantly when Ss were not expecting the particular letters which were presented. Additional exposures significantly reduced this difference, thereby generating a perceptual learning curve in terms of response latency. The main findings were interpreted in terms of a model of perceptual processing which involves mechanisms for hierarchical coding, selective attention, and automatic processing."

According to the model, the first stage of linguistic processing is carried out in short-term memory (M1) and involves a superficial analysis of semantic and syntactic features of words. The second stage is carried out in long-term memory (M2) and involves application of transformational rules to the analyses of M1 so as to determine the deep or underlying relations among words and phrases. According to the theory, attention is an M2 process: preliminary analyses by M1 are carried out even for unattended inputs, but final analyses by M2 are only carried out for attended inputs. The theory was shown to be consistent with established facts concerning memory, attention and comprehension, and additional support for the theory was obtained in a series of dichotic listening experiments."

When the target is the last item in a list, it is readily identified at all presentation rates, but when it is the first word or is embedded in a list, recognition accuracy is inversely related to presentation rate. In the second study, the differentiation between target and filler items is in terms of the presence or absence of category membership. All Ss at all presentation rates do significantly better on lists with an animal word as a target and a set of unrelated words as filler items than on the converse arrangement."

This was accomplished with two experimental conditions, one with blank poststimulus field and one with noisy poststimulus field, for six Ss run 650 trials each. Three mathematical models of recognition, two based on the concept of a finite number of sensory states and one being the choice model, were compared in their ability to predict the confusion matrix after their parameters were estimated from functions of the data. In order to ascertain the facility with which estimates of similarity among the letters could lead to a psychological space containing the letters, \u03b7ij, the similarity parameter of the choice model was input to an ordinally based multidimensional scaling program. Finally, correlation coefficients were computed among parameters of the models, the scaled space, and a crude measure of physical similarity. Briefly, the results were: (1) the finite-state model that assumed stimulus similarity (the overlap activation model) and the choice model predicted the confusion-matrix entries about equally well in terms of a sum-of-squared deviations criterion and better than the all-or-none activation model, which assumed only a perfect perception or random-guessing state following a stimulus presentation; (2) the parts of the confusion matrix that fit best varied with the particular model, and this finding was related to the models; (3) the best scaling result in terms of a goodness-of-fit measure was obtained with the blank poststimulus field condition, with a technique allowing different distances for tied similarity values, and with the Euclidean as opposed to the city-block metric; and (4) there was agreement among the models in terms of the way in which the models reflected sensory and response bias structure in the data, and in the way in which a single model measured these attributes across experimental conditions, as well as agreement among similarity ami distance measures with physical Similarity."

Moray (1969) proposes that there is no processing of the unattended message, whereas Norman (1969) has suggested that it is analyzed to the level of meaning. In order to test these alternative hypotheses an experiment was performed in which galvanic skin responses (GSR) were conditioned to a word (CS) by pairing it with shock. The word was then included in passages of prose presented to subjects as the attended and unattended messages in a dichotic listening task. GSR's were obtained to the occurrence of CS in the unattended message and also to words acoustically similar to CS and to synonyms of CS. The probability of obtaining a GSR to the occurrence of an accoustically similar word was increased by placing that word in a context appropriate to CS. These results suggest that the unattended message can be processed to a level at which semantic information is extracted without the subject's reported awareness."

It was an attempt to replicate and clarify an earlier finding by Lewis (1970).

However, this occurred only with synonyms in an early list position and appeared to affect only a small proportion of trials. The implications of this and other recent findings for theories of selective listening are discussed."

The present paper examines six of them. All can be exemplified using the syllable /da/ as in dot, and all occur during dichotic listening. In each type of fusion, the robustness of the fused percept is observed against variation in three parameters: the relative onset time of the two opposite-ear stimuli, their relative intensity, and their relative fundamental frequency. Patterns of results are used to confirm the arrangement of the six fusions in a hierarchy, and supporting data are summoned in an analysis of the mechanisms that underlie each with reference to speech. The six fusions are sound localization, psychoacoustic fusion, spectral fusion, spectral/temporal fusion, phonetic feature fusion, and phonological fusion. They occur at three, perhaps four, different levels of perceptual analysis. The first two levels are characterized by perceptual integration, the other (s) by perceptual disruption and recombination."
