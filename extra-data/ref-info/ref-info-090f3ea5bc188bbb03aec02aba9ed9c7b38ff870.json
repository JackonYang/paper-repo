This is done in the framework of a standard statistical pattern recognition model. Both the vector quantizer and the hidden Markov models need to be trained for the vocabulary being recognized. Such training results in a distinct hidden Markov model for each word of the vocabulary. Classification consists of computing the probability of generating the test word with each word model and choosing the word model that gives the highest probability. There are several factors, in both the vector quantizer and the hidden Markov modeling, that affect the performance of the overall word recognition system, including the size of the vector quantizer, the structure of the hidden Markov model, the ways of handling insufficient training data, etc. The effects, on recognition accuracy, of many of these factors are discussed in this paper. The entire recognizer (training and testing) has been evaluated on a 10-word digits vocabulary. For training, a set of 100 talkers spoke each of the digits one time. For testing, an independent set of 100 tokens of each of the digits was obtained. The overall recognition accuracy was found to be 96.5 percent for the 100-talker test set. These results are comparable to those obtained in earlier work, using a dynamic time-warping recognition algorithm with multiple templates per digit. It is also shown that the computation and storage requirements of the new recognizer were an order of magnitude less than that required for a conventional pattern recognition system using linear prediction with dynamic time warping."

In this paper we approach the problem from an information-theoretic point of view. We describe the overall structure of a linguistic statistical decoder (LSD) for the recognition of continuous speech. The input to the decoder is a string of phonetic symbols estimated by an acoustic processor (AP). For each phonetic string, the decoder finds the most likely input sentence. The decoder consists of four major subparts: 1) a statistical model of the language being recognized; 2) a phonemic dictionary and statistical phonological rules characterizing the speaker; 3) a phonetic matching algorithm that computes the similarity between phonetic strings, using the performance characteristics of the AP; 4) a word level search control. The details of each of the subparts and their interaction during the decoding process are discussed."

It is the purpose of this paper to outline two aspects of speech-recognition research. First, we discuss word recognition as a classical pattern-recognition problem and show how some fundamental concepts of signal processing, information theory, and computer science can be combined to give us the capability of robust recognition of isolated words and simple connected word sequences. We then describe methods whereby these principles, augmented by modern theories of formal language and semantic analysis, can be used to study some of the more general problems in speech recognition. It is anticipated that these methods will ultimately lead to accurate mechanical recognition of fluent speech under certain controlled conditions."

We have recently (July and August 1978) achieved error-free or nearly error-free decoding results with several different acoustic processors on sentences from the New Raleigh Language (vocabulary 250 words, perplexity 7.27 words). One of these processors, which achieved a 0% error rate on New Raleigh sentences, has been used to decode sentences from the New Raleigh Language without the benefit of syntactic guidance during the decoding process. On this much more difficult task, it has achieved an error rate of 8.8% at the word level, corresponding to a sentence error rate of 53%. All of these processors are non-segmenting processors which produce output once every 10ms."

This distinction is made primarily on the basis of the difficulty of solving these two types of nonlinear problems. The first type is the less difficult of the two, and in this, Part I of the paper, it is shown how it is solved by the gradient projection method. It should be noted that since a linear objective function is a special case of a nonlinear objective function, the gradient projection method will also solve a linear programming problem. In Part II of the paper [16], the extension of the gradient projection method to the more difficult problem of nonlinear constraints and equations will be described. The basic paper on linear programming is the paper by Dantzig [5] in which the simplex method for solving the linear programming problem is presented. The nonlinear programming problem is formulated and a necessary and sufficient condition for a constrained maximum is given in terms of an equivalent saddle value problem in the paper by Kuhn and Tucker [10]. Further developments motivated by this paper, including a computational procedure, have been published recently [1]. The gradient projection method was originally presented to the American Mathematical Society"
