A log-linear regression model uses these constraints to predict whether conjoined adjectives are of same or different orientations, achieving 82% accuracy in this task when each conjunction is considered independently. Combining the constraints across many adjectives, a clustering algorithm separates the adjectives into groups of different orientations, and finally, adjectives are labeled positive or negative. Evaluations on real data and simulation experiments indicate high levels of performance: classification precision is more than 90% for adjectives that occur in a modest number of conjunctions in the corpus."

Judgments of the type \"A is larger than B\" or \"This can contains less milk than that\" are made long before it is possible to say, e.g., \"A is twice as large as B\" or \"A has a volume of 25 cubic feet, B a volume of 20 cubic feet, therefore A is larger than B by 5 cubic feet,\" or \"This can contains a quart of milk, that one 3 quarts of milk, therefore the former has less milk in it.\" In other words, judgments of quantity in terms of units of measure or in terms of number always presuppose, explicitly or implicitly, preliminary judgments of grading. The term four means something only when it is known to refer to a number which is \"less than\" certain others, say five, six, seven, arranged in an ordered series of relative mores and lesses, and \"more than\" certain others, say one, two, three, arranged in an ordered series of relative mores and lesses. Similarly, a foot as a unit of linear measure has no meaning whatever unless it is known to be more than some other stretch, say an inch, and less than a third stretch, say a yard. Judgments of \"more than\" and \"less than\" may be said to be based on perceptions of \"envelopment.\" If A can be \"enveloped by\" B, contained by it, so placed in contact with B, either actually or by the imagination, as to seem to be held within its compass instead of extending beyond it, it is judged to be \"less than\" B, while B is judged to be \"more than\" A. With only two existents of the same class, A and B, the judgments \"A is less than B\" and \"B is more than A\" can be translated into the form \"A is small\" and \"B is large.\" In the case of the two cans of milk, we may say \"There is little milk in this can\" and \"There is much milk in that can.\" Again, if there are three men in one room and seven in another, we may either say \"The first room has fewer men in it than the second\" and \"The second room has more men in it than the first\" or, if we prefer, \"The first room has few men in it\" and \"The second room has many men in it.\"1 Such contrasts as small and large, little and much, few and many, give us a deceptive feeling of absolute values within the field of quantity comparable to such qualitative differences as red and green within the field of color perception. This feeling is an illusion, however, which is largely due to the linguistic fact that the grading which is implicit in these terms is not formally indicated, whereas it is made explicit in such judgments as \"There were fewer people there than here\" or \"He has more milk than I.\" In other words, many, to take but one example, embodies no class of judgments clustering about a given quantity norm which is applicable to every type of experience, in the sense in which red or green is applicable to every experience in which color can have a place, but is, properly speaking, a purely relative term which loses all significance when deprived of its conno-"

The reason is that knowledge resources (lexicons, grammar rules, world models) must be painstakingly handcrafted from scratch. One of the hypotheses being tested in the PAN-GLOSS machine translation project is whether or not these resources can be semi-automatically acquired on a very large scale. \n \nThis paper focuses on the construction of a large ontology (or knowledge base, or world model) for supporting KBMT. It contains representations for some 70,000 commonly encountered objects, processes, qualities, and relations. The ontology was constructed by merging various online dictionaries, semantic networks, and bilingual resources, through semi-automatic methods. Some of these methods (e.g., conceptual matching of semantic taxonomies) are broadly applicable to problems of importing/exporting knowledge from one KB to another. Other methods (e.g., bilingual matching) allow a knowledge engineer to build up an index to a KB in a second language, such as Spanish or Japanese."

This paper outlines recent attempt at USC/ISI to create a single large Ontology for general free use over the Web, as performed under the aegis of the ANSI Ad Hoc Committee on Ontology Standardization. Eventually, this socalled Reference Ontology may combine the existing largescale ontologies WordNet, MIKROKOSMOS, EDR, CYC, and SENSUS into a single framework.

It is treated as neither a \\natural\" entity waiting to be discovered nor a purely theoretical construct. This paper describes how a semantico-pragmatic analyzer, Mikrokosmos, uses knowledge from a situated ontology as well as from language-speciic knowledge sources (lexicons and microtheory rules). Also presented are some guidelines for acquiring ontological concepts and an overview of the technology developed in the Mikrokosmos project for large-scale acquisition and maintenance of ontological databases. Tools for acquiring, maintaining, and browsing ontologies can be shared more readily than ontologies themselves. Ontological knowledge bases can be shared as computational resources if such tools provide translators between diierent representation formats. 1 A Situated Ontology World models (ontologies) in computational applications are artiicially constructed entities. They are created, not discovered. This is why so many diierent world models were suggested. Many ontologies are developed for purely theoretical purposes or without the context of a practical situation (e. Many practical knowledge-based systems, on the other hand, employ world or domain models without recognizing them as a separate knowledge source (e.g., Farwell, et al. 1993). In the eld of natural language processing (NLP) there is now a consensus that all NLP systems that seek to represent and manipulate meanings of texts need an ontology (e. In our continued eeorts to build a multilingual knowledge-based machine translation (KBMT) system using an interlingual meaning representation (e.g., Onyshkevych and Nirenburg, 1994), we have developed an ontology to facilitate natural language interpretation and generation. The central goal of the Mikrokosmos project is to develop a system that produces a comprehensive Text Meaning Representation (TMR) for an input text in any of a set of source languages. 1 Knowledge that supports this process is stored both in language-speciic knowledge sources and in an independently motivated, language-neutral ontology (e. An ontology for NLP purposes is a body of knowledge about the world (or a domain) that a) is a repository of primitive symbols used in meaning representation; b) organizes these symbols in a tangled subsumption hierarchy; and c) further interconnects these symbols using a rich system of semantic and discourse-pragmatic relations deened among the concepts. In order for such an ontology to become a computational resource for solving problems such as ambiguity and reference resolution, it must be actually constructed, not merely deened formally, as is the \u2026"
