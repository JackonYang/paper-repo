Loose and textured clothing, occlusion and scene clutter make it a difficult problem because bottom-up segmentation and grouping do not always work. We address the problem of detecting humans from their motion pattern in monocular image sequences; extraneous motions and occlusion may be present. We assume that we may not rely on segmentation or grouping and that the vision front-end is limited to observing the motion of key points and textured patches in between pairs of frames. We do not assume that we are able to track features for more than two frames. Our method is based on learning an approximate probabilistic model of the joint position and velocity of different body features. Detection is performed by hypothesis testing on the maximum a posteriori estimate of the pose and motion of the body. Our experiments on a dozen of walking sequences indicate that our algorithm is accurate and efficient."

Within a Bayesian framework, we define a generative model of image appearance, a robust likelihood function based on image graylevel differences, and a prior probability distribution over pose and joint angles that models how humans move. The posterior probability distribution over model parameters is represented using a discrete set of samples and is propagated over time using particle filtering. The approach extends previous work on parameterized optical flow estimation to exploit a complex 3D articulated motion model. It also extends previous work on human motion tracking by including a perspective camera model, by modeling limb self occlusion, and by recovering 3D motion from a monocular sequence. The explicit posterior probability distribution represents ambiguities due to image matching, model singularities, and perspective projection. The method relies only on a frame-to-frame assumption of brightness constancy and hence is able to track people under changing viewpoints, in grayscale image sequences, and with complex unknown backgrounds."

We introduce the use of a novel mathematical technique, the product of exponential maps and twist motions, and its integration into a differential motion estimation. This results in solving simple linear systems, and enables us to recover robustly the kinematic degrees-of-freedom in noise and complex self occluded configurations. We demonstrate this on several image sequences of people doing articulated full body movements, and visualize the results in re-animating an artificial 3D human model. We are also able to recover and re-animate the famous movements of Eadweard Muybridge's motion studies from the last century. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computer vision based system that is able to process such challenging footage and recover complex motions with such high accuracy."

Within a Bayesian framework, we define a generative model of image appearance, a robust likelihood function based on image graylevel differences, and a prior probability distribution over pose and joint angles that models how humans move. The posterior probability distribution over model parameters is represented using a discrete set of samples and is propagated over time using particle filtering. The approach extends previous work on parameterized optical flow estimation to exploit a complex 3D articulated motion model. It also extends previous work on human motion tracking by including a perspective camera model, by modeling limb self occlusion, and by recovering 3D motion from a monocular sequence. The explicit posterior probability distribution represents ambiguities due to image matching, model singularities, and perspective projection. The method relies only on a frame-to-frame assumption of brightness constancy and hence is able to track people under changing viewpoints, in grayscale image sequences, and with complex unknown backgrounds."

Probabilistic mechanisms are attractive because they handle fusion of information, especially temporal fusion, in a principled manner. Exemplars are selected representatives of raw training data, used here to represent probabilistic mixture distributions of object configurations. Their use avoids tedious hand-construction of object models, and problems with changes of topology.Using exemplars in place of a parameterized model poses several challenges, addressed here with what we call the \u201cMetric Mixture\u201d (M2) approach, which has a number of attractions. Principally, it provides alternatives to standard learning algorithms by allowing the use of metrics that are not embedded in a vector space. Secondly, it uses a noise model that is learned from training data. Lastly, it eliminates any need for an assumption of probabilistic pixelwise independence.Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the M2 model in two domains: tracking walking people using \u201cchamfer\u201d distances on binary edge images, and tracking mouth movements by means of a shuffle distance."

The basic approach is to store a number of exemplar 2D views of the human body in a variety of different configurations and viewpoints with respect to the camera. On each of these stored views, the locations of the body joints (left elbow, right knee, etc.) are manually marked and labelled for future use. The test shape is then matched to each stored view, using the technique of shape context matching in conjunction with a kinematic chain-based deformation model. Assuming that there is a stored view sufficiently similar in configuration and pose, the correspondence process will succeed. The locations of the body joints are then transferred from the exemplar view to the test shape. Given the joint locations, the 3D body configuration and pose are then estimated. We can apply this technique to video by treating each frame independently - tracking just becomes repeated recognition! We present results on a variety of datasets."

Search algorithms, either deterministic or stochastic, that search such a space without constraint, fall foul of exponential computational complexity. One approach is to introduce constraints: either labelling using markers or colour coding, prior assumptions about motion trajectories or view restrictions. Another is to relax constraints arising from articulation, and track limbs as if their motions were independent. In contrast, we aim for general tracking without special preparation of objects or restrictive assumptions. The principal contribution of the paper is the development of a modified particle filter for search in high dimensional configuration spaces. It uses a continuation principle based on annealing to introduce the influence of narrow peaks in the fitness function, gradually. The new algorithm, termed annealed particle filtering, is shown to be capable of recovering full articulated body motion efficiently."

                "text": "A novel deformable template is presented which detects and localizes shapes in grayscale images. The template is formulated as a Bayesian graphical model of a two-dimensional shape contour, and it is matched to the image using a variant of the belief propagation (BP) algorithm used for inference on graphical models. The algorithm can localize a target shape contour in a cluttered image and can accommodate arbitrary global translation and rotation of the target as well as significant shape deformations, without requiring the template to be initialized in any special way (e.g. near the target).The use of BP removes a serious restriction imposed in related earlier work, in which the matching is performed by dynamic programming and thus requires the graphical model to be tree-shaped (i.e. without loops). Although BP is not guaranteed to converge when applied to inference on non-tree-shaped graphs, we find empirically that it does converge even for deformable template models with one or more loops. To speed up the BP algorithm, we augment it by a pruning procedure and a novel technique, inspired by the 20 Questions (divide-and-conquer) search strategy, called \"focused message updating.\" These modifications boost the speed of convergence by over an order of magnitude, resulting in an algorithm that detects and localizes shapes in grayscale images in as little as several seconds on an 850 MHz AMD processor."

We call the model a probabilistic montage. The model is based upon the idea that an image can be represented as a montage using many, small transformed and cropped patches from a collection of latent images. The approach is similar to that which might be employed by a police artist who might represent an image of a criminal suspect's face using a montage of face parts cut out of a \"library\" of face parts. In contrast, for our model, we learn the library of small latent images from a set of examples of objects that are changing in shape. In our approach, first the image is divided into a grid of sub-images. Each sub-image in the grid acts as window that crops a piece out of one of a collection of slightly larger images possible for that location in the image. We illustrate various probability models that can be used to encode the appropriate relationships for latent images and cropping transformations among the different patches. In this paper we present the complete algorithm for a tree-structured model. We show how the approach and model are able to find representations of the appearance of full body images of people in motion. We show how our approach can be used to learn representations of objects in an \"unsupervised\" manner and present results using our model for recognition and tracking purposes in a \"supervised\" manner."

The basic computational module of the technique is an old pattern recognition procedure: the mean shift. For discrete data, we prove the convergence of a recursive mean shift procedure to the nearest stationary point of the underlying density function and, thus, its utility in detecting the modes of the density. The relation of the mean shift procedure to the Nadaraya-Watson estimator from kernel regression and the robust M-estimators; of location is also established. Algorithms for two low-level vision tasks discontinuity-preserving smoothing and image segmentation - are described as applications. In these algorithms, the only user-set parameter is the resolution of the analysis, and either gray-level or color images are accepted as input. Extensive experimental results illustrate their excellent performance."

Each part is represented using a simple appearance model and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. While pictorial structures were introduced a number of years ago, they have not been broadly applied to matching and recognition problems. This has been due in part to the computational difficulty of matching pictorial structures to images. In this paper we present an efficient algorithm for finding the best global match of a pictorial stucture to an image. With this improved algorithm, pictorial structures provide a practical and powerful framework for quantitative descriptions of objects and scenes, and are suitable for many generic image recognition problems. We illustrate the approach using simple models of a person and a car."

The max-product b\u0308elief propagation\u0308 algorithm is a localmessage passing algorithm on this graph that is known to converge to a unique fixed point when the graph is a tree. Furthermore, when the graph is a tree, the assignment based on the fixed-point is guaranteed to yields the most probable a posteriori (MAP) values of the unobserved variables given the observed ones. Here we prove a result on the fixed points of max-product on a graph with arbitrary toplogy and with arbitrary probability distributions (discrete or continuous valued nodes). We show that the assignment based on the fixed-point is a n\u0308eighborhood maximum\u0308 of the posterior probability: the posterior probability of the max-product assignment is guaranteed to be greater than all other assignments in a particular large region around that assignment. The region includes all assignments that differ from the max-product assignment in any subset of nodes that form no more than a single loop in the graph. In some graphs this neighborhood is exponentially large. We illustrate the analysis with examples. This work may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part for any commercial purpose.

It includes belief propagation (BP), which can be reformulated as a very local form of reparameterization. More generally, we consider algorithms that perform exact computations over spanning trees of the full graph. On the practical side, we find that such tree reparameterization (TRP) algorithms have convergence properties superior to BP. The reparameterization perspective also provides a number of theoretical insights into approximate inference, including a new characterization of fixed points; and an invariance intrinsic to TRP/BP. These two properties enable us to analyze and bound the error between the TRP/BP approximations and the actual marginals. While our results arise naturally from the TRP perspective, most of them apply in an algorithm-independent manner to any local minimum of the Bethe free energy. Our results also have natural extensions to more structured approximations [e.g., 1, 2]."
