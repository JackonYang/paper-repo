In general, however, trade-offs between image intensity and surface shape emerge which cannot be resolved in a single view. Existing methods for determining shape from a single view embody assumptions about surface curvature. The image Hessian matrix is introduced as a convenient viewer-centered representation of surface curvature. Properties of surface curvature are expressed as properties of the Hessian matrix. For several classes of surfaces, image analysis simplifies. This result has already been established for planar surfaces. Similar simplification is demonstrated for singly curved surfaces and for the subclass of doubly curved surfaces known as generalized cones. These studies help to delineate shape information that can be determined from object boundaries and shape information that can be determined from shading."

The idea of photometric stereo is to vary the direction of incident illumination between successive images, while holding the viewing direction constant. It is shown that this provides sufficient information to determine surface orientation at each image point. Since the imaging geometry is not changed, the correspondence between image points is known a priori. The technique is photometric because it uses the radiance values recorded at a single image location, in successive views, rather than the relative positions of displaced features. Photometric stereo is used in computer-based image understanding. It can be applied in two ways. First, it is a general technique for deter-mining surface orientation at each image point. Second, it is a technique for determining object points that have a particular surface orientation. These applications are illustrated using synthesized examples."

Therefore, implicit in the perceptual analysis of occluding contour must lie various assumptions about the viewed surfaces. The assumptions that seem most natural are (a) that the distinction between convex and concave segments reflects real properties of the viewed surface; and (b) that contiguous portions of contour arise from contiguous parts of the viewed surface \u2013 i. e. there are no invisible obscuring edges. It is proved that, for smooth surfaces, these assumptions are essentially equivalent to assuming that the viewed surface is a generalized cone. Methods are defined for finding the axis of such a cone, and for segmenting a surface constructed of several cones into its components, whose axes can then be found separately. These methods provide one link between an uninterpreted figure extracted from an image, and the 3-D representation theory of Marr & Nishihara (1977)."

                "text": "A general and rigorous treatment is given of the photometric method for deriving surface elevation information from a single picture of the surface. In the course of the derivation a brief indication is given of possible photometric function symmetries yielding exact solutions to the problem. It is shown that the photometric properties of the lunar maria are sufficient to produce an exact solution but with an inherent practical difficulty. The resulting equations are then specialized to the case of lunar photography and applied to the Ranger pictures as part of a digital processing procedure. Examples of the resulting elevation maps are given. INTRODUCTION QUANTITATIVE ELEVATION INFORMATION about a surface can be derived from pictures both by stereoscopic and by photometric methods. The second method, which is of interest here, was first suggested by van Diggelen (Ref. 1) in 1951. Extending his original formulation of the problem, it is desired to reconstruct quantitatively the shape of a surface being photographed using the imaging geometry, the facsi mile system transfer characteristics, and the surface photometric properties. A rigorous solution to this problem is presented and the results are applied to the lunar pictures taken by the three Ranger impacting spacecraft. CALCULATION OF ELEVATIONS IN TEl{]vIS OF A LENS-CENTERED COORDINATE SYSTEM The pertinent photometry of extended surfaces can be summarized as follows. For simplicity, it will be assumed that the surface possesses homogenous photometric properties at least over the local area under consideration. The photometric geometry can be com pletely defined in terms of three angles; the incidence angle i (angle between the direction of incident light and the surface normal), the emission angle e (angle between the direction of emitted light and the surface normal), and the phase angle g (angle between the directions of incident and emitted light). This geometry is shown in Figure 1. For uniform collimated illumination of the surface, such as with sunlight, the luminence b can be written b(i, e, g) = poEo\u00a2(i, e, g) (1) where Po is the normal albedo of the surface, Eo is the uniform illumination intensity, and \u00a2 (i, e, g) is the surface photometric function. The normalization of \u00a2 is such that \u00a2(O, 0, 0) = 1. * This paper presents the results of one phase of research conducted at J.P.L., California Institute of Technology, under Contract No. NAS 7-100, sponsored by NASA.

Automatic navigation using visible light or radar images requires exact alignment of such images with digital terrain models. In addition, automatic classification of terrain, using satellite imagery, requires such alignment to deal correctly with the effects of varying sun angle and surface slope. Even inspection techniques for certain industrial parts may be improved by this means.\nWe achieve the required alignment by matching the real image with a synthetic image obtained from a surface model and known positions of the light sources. The synthetic image intensity is calculated using the reflectance map, a convenient way of describing surface reflection as a function of surface gradient. We illustrate the technique using LANDSAT images and digital terrain models."

The reflectance map, showing scene radiance as a function of surface gradient, has proved to be helpful in this endeavor. The reflectance map depends both on the nature of the surface layers of the objects being imaged and the distribution of light sources. Recently, a unified approach to the specification of surface reflectance in terms of both incident and reflected beam geometry has been proposed. The reflecting properties of a surface are specified in terms of the bidirectional reflectance-distribution function (BRDF). Here we derive the reflectance map in terms of the BRDF and the distribution of source radiance. A number of special cases of practical importance are developed in detail. The significance of this approach to the understanding of image formation is briefly indicated."

A fixed illumination, surface material and imaging geometry is incorporated into a single model, called a reflectance map, that allows observed brightness to be written as a function of surface orientation. The reflectance map is used to generate synthetic images from digital terrain models. Synthetic images are used to predict properties of real images. This technique is illustrated using Landsat imagery. Accurate shadow regions are determined from a digital terrain model by calculating which surface elements are visible from the light source. Once shadows are determined, the effect of sky illumination and atmospheric haze is estimated."
