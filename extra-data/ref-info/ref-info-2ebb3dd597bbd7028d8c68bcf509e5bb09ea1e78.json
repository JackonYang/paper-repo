To illustrate the technique, a series of tests is described of its application to a small data base in an experimental environment.

These techniques are presented as a natural extension of weighting methods using information about the distribution of index terms in documents in general. A series of relevance weighting functions is derived and is justified by theoretical considerations. In particular, it is shown that specific weighted search methods are implied by a general probabilistic theory of retrieval. Different applications of relevance weighting are illustrated by experimental results for test collections."

This study presents a realistic method for estimating the term relevance weights from information derived in an interactive search environment where relevance assessments for previously retrieved items are used later to construct improved query statements. Procedures are introduced for constructing the initial query weights by using estimated term relevance factors. These initial weights are then modified during the relevance feedback process by utilizing the occurrence frequencies of the terms in the retrieved documents obtained from an earlier search. The procedures used to construct the term relevance weights are covered in detail, and experimental output is included to illustrate the effectiveness of the methods."

In this paper we consider the situation where no relevance information is available, that is, at the start of the search. Based on a probabilistic model, strategies are proposed for the initial search and an intermediate search. Retrieval experiments with the Cranfield collection of 1,400 documents show that this initial search strategy is better than conventional search strategies both in terms of retrieval effectiveness and in terms of the number of queries that retrieve relevant documents. The intermediate search is shown to be a useful substitute for a relevance feedback search. Experiments with queries that do not retrieve relevant documents at high rank positions indicate that a cluster search would be an effective alternative strategy."

Boolean logic is commonly employed as the query language, but an alternate scheme based on the vector space model has been investigated. Automatic indexing methods allow questions and documents to be represented by weighted vectors, and searching yields a ranked list of documents in decreasing order of query-document similarity. Both the Boolean logic and vector space approaches are special cases of the very general p-norm model developed by Wu. \nIn this thesis, analytical results help explain the ranking behavior of p-norm queries. Four experimental test collections are employed to prove that interpreting Boolean queries with p-norm techniques leads to substantial improvements in retrieval effectiveness. Several procedures are described to automatically construct Boolean queries from short lists of words. An algorithm based on probability theory which utilizes relevance feedback information to produce even more effective Boolean or p-norm queries is also specified and validated by experimental tests; one of the essential innovations is to control query construction by allowing the searcher to specify the desired number of retrieved documents. \nThe vector space model is extended to allow separate handling of other types of concepts beyond those derived from textual words or assigned descriptors. Citation, cocitation, and bibliographic coupling data as well as factual information normally handled by database management systems are easily incorporated. Clustered search and feedback processes are improved by utilizing combinations of these concept types, as shown by preliminary experimental studies with collections in computer and information science. \nP-norm queries and multiple concept types are both handled by an updated SMART system implemented using relational database and statistical processing packages. This integrated system should facilitate further research as well as be adaptable to retrieval applications for office and bibliographic information."

The successes of these models are unlikely to be accidental; it is of interest therefore to examine the similarities between the two models. The disadvantage of the BLE model is the exponential number of terms appearings in the full expression, while a truncated BLE system may produce negative probability values. The disadvantage of the tree dependence model is the restriction to dependencies between certain term pairs only and the exclusion of higher-order dependencies. A generalized term dependence model is introduced in this study which does not carry the disadvantages of either the tree dependence or the BLE models. Sample evaluation results are included to demonstrate the usefulness of the generalized system."

The authors have been able to run many trials of experiments in instances where previously, running just one would have been considered an achievement and no further experimentation would have been done. This has enabled exploring a great many more hypotheses and to work on much larger problems that had been possible on previous-generation artificial intelligence workstations. The ease of programming is in part the result of a decision to use existing serial machines (the Symbolics 3600 or Digital Equipment Corporation VAX), thus leaving unchanged the operating systems, editors, file systems, debuggers, network communications systems, and so on, so as to provide familiar programming environments.
