A semantic network purports to represent concepts expressed by natural-language words and phrases as nodes connected to other such concepts by a particular set of arcs called semantic relations. Primitive concepts in this system of semantic networks are word-sense meanings. Primitive semantic relations are those that the verb of a sentence has with its subject, object, and prepositional phrase arguments in addition to those that underlie common lexical, classificational and modificational relations. A complete statement of semantic relations would include all those relations that would be required in the total classification of a natural language vocabulary. We consider the theory and model of semantic nets to be a computational theory of superficial verbal understanding in humans. W e conceive semantic nodes as representing human verbal concept structures and semantic relations connecting two such structures as representing the linguistic processes of thought that are used to combine them into natural-language descriptions of events. Some psycholin-guistic evidence supports this theory"

It is argued that an adequate characterization of \u2018what we know\u2019 requires that we posit abstract mental structures to which we do not have conscious access and which are essentially conceptual and propositional, rather than sensory or pictorial, in nature. Such representations are more accurately referred to as symbolic descriptions than as images in the usual sense. Implications of using an imagery vocabulary are examined, and it is argued that the picture metaphor underlying recent theoretical discussions is seriously misleading \u2014 especially as it suggests that the image is an entity to be perceived. The relative merits of several alternative modes of representation (propositions, data structures, and procedures) are discussed. The final section is a more speculative discussion of the nature of the representation which may be involved when people \u2018use\u2019 visual images."

A scene, as seen for instance from a TV camera or a picture, can be transformed into a symbolic description of points and lines or surfaces. This thesis describes several programs, written in the language CONVERT , for the analysis of such descriptions in order to recognize, differentiate and identify desired objects or classes or objects in the scene. Examples are given in each case. Although the recognition might be in terms of projections of 2-dim and 3-dim objects, we do not deal with stereoscopic information. One of our programs (Polybrick) identifies parallelepipeds in a scene which may contain hidden bodies and non-parallelepipedic objects. The program TD works mainly with 2-dimensional figures, although under certain conditions successfully identifies 3-dim objects. Overlapping objects are identified when they are transparent. A third program, DT, works with 3-dim and 2-dim objects, and does not identify objects which are not completely seen. Important restrictions and suppositions are: (a) the input is assumed perfect (noiseless), and in a symbolic format; (b) no perspective deformation is considered. A portion of this thesis is devoted to the study of models (symbolic representation) of the objects we want to identify; different schemes, some of them already in use, are discussed. Focusing our attention on the more general problem of identification of general objects when they substantially overlap, we propose some schemes for their recognition, and also analyze some problems that are met."

In this respect a child's work in an art class is often close to that of a grown\u2010up artist. The paper presents the results of some mathematical research guided by the goal of producing mathematical concepts and topics to close this gap. The prime example used here is \u2018Turtle Geometry\u2019, which is concerned with programming a moving point to generate geometric forms. By embodying the moving point as a \u2018cybernetic turtle\u2019 controlled by an actual computer, the constructive aspects of the theory come out sufficiently to capture the minds and imaginations of almost all the elementary school children with whom we have worked\u2014including some at the lowest levels of previous mathematical perfo..."

The objects are three-dimensional line drawing description of the object by edge following techniques. The object is rotated in space so that all surfaces of the object are observed and the interconnections of all surfaces are determined. The line drawing descriptions of the object are used by the computer to form a complete description of the object which is position invariant. No previous knowledge about the object being observed is supplied to the computer program except that the surfaces of the object are planar. After a library of different objects has been obtained by the computer, any one of these objects may be placed before the television camera in any position. The computer will recognize and name the object being observed by matching its description to a description stored in the library. (Author)"

In style and treatment it is not well adapted to beginners, yet in its descriptive matter it is quite elementary. Probably it will prove of greatest service to mature students of other subjects who wish to gain some acquaintance with the principles of chemistry without intending to study the science practically. The author tells us in his preface that his object has been \u201cto present some of the fundamental facts, generalisations principles and theories of chemistry, lucidly, methodically, and suggestively.\u201d In this he has had a certain measure of success, but the general impression left by the book is that in its construction substance has been sacrificed to form. When, for example, the author tells us (p. 89) that weighed quantities of the basic oxides BaO, CaO, K2O, Na2O, have been combined with weighed quantities of the acidic oxides I2O5, N2O5, P2O5, P2O5 respectively, and that analysis showed the resulting products to be BaI2O6, CaN2O6, K3PO4, and Na3PO4, we are inclined to doubt the statement, and also to doubt the wisdom of adducing imaginary experiments in confirmation of a formal rule. On p. 252 we find the equation \u201cNa2O + N2O5 (heated) = 2NaNO3.\u201dThe Elements of Chemistry.By M. M. Pattison Muir. Pp. xiv + 554. (London: J. and A. Churchill, 1904.) Price 10s. 6d. net."
