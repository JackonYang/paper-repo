Analogous spectral representations exist for stationary processes with a multidimensional parameter t = (tl, t2, *--, tn), that is, for homogeneous random fields t(t) in an n-dimensional space Rn, and for a more general class of homogeneous fields on an arbitrary locally compact commutative group G [see formulas (2.21) to (2.23) below]. Moreover, in the case of a homogeneous field t(t) with t E Rn any additional assumptions about its symmetry impose special restrictions on the covariance function B(T) and on the spectral measures F(A) and Z(A). From the point of view of applications the most interesting is the case of a homogeneous and isotropic random field, that is, the homogeneous field t(t) which possesses spherical symmetry.

The reader may wonder why the general theory is not stated in part 2 and then applied to the special problem. The answer is that the general theory appeared as a necessary generalization of theorems stated in part 2, after the two first parts had been written, and the author thought that he would not have enough time before this Symposium to reorganize the paper. Moreover, part 2 will be a good introduction to the general theory. In the introduction the author will begin with the general theory, and the reader who wishes to do so may begin with part 3. The problem considered in this theory is to find an explicit representation of Gaussian r.f.(1) of a real variable t that may be considered as the canonical form of this function. By subtraction of a known function, it may be reduced to a Gaussian r.f. phi(t) with identically zero expectation. Such a r.f. is generally defined by its covariance gamma(t(1),t(s)), or by a stochastic differential equation with a Cauchy condition. None of these methods gives an explicit representation of phi(t)."

An optimal recipe for classifying such patterns is described. It combines the use of an orthonormal expansion for the logarithm of probability functions, with the generation of a joint probability distribution from lower-order marginals. The unwieldy nature of the optimal recipe leads to the consideration of dependence represented by a Markov chain and a two-dimensional analog called a Markov mesh. The Markov chain has a \"reflecting\" property in that the r th order nonstationary chain implies that a point depends on its r nearest neighbors on each side. By scanning along a grid-filling curve so that the 2r neighbors of a point are geometrically close to it, certain spatial dependencies are obtained. The grid-filling curves are sequences of functions which have Hilbert \"space-filling\" curves as their limit. This simple approach does not provide for many of the spatial dependencies that should be considered. A novel extension of Markov chain methods into two dimensions leads to the Markov mesh which economically takes care of a much larger class of spatial dependencies. Likelihood ratio classification based on Markov chain and Markov mesh assumptions requires the estimation of a much smaller number of parameters than the general case. The development presented in this paper is new and need not be restricted to binary variables."

In this case there is a spectral representation for this field, similar to that for stationary random processes, which consists of a superposition of traveling waves. The frequency-wavenumber power spectral density provides the mean-square value for the amplitudes of these waves and is of considerable importance in the analysis of propagating waves by means of an array of sensors. The conventional method of frequency-wavenumber power spectral density estimation uses a fixed-wavenumber window and its resolution is determined essentially by the beam pattern of the array of sensors. A high-resolution method of estimation is introduced which employs a wavenumber window whose shape changes and is a function of the wavenumber at which an estimate is obtained. It is shown that the wavenumber resolution of this method is considerably better than that of the conventional method. Application of these results is given to seismic data obtained from the large aperture seismic array located in eastern Montana. In addition, the application of the high-resolution method to other areas, such as radar, sonar, and radio astronomy, is indicated."
