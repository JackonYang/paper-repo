The need for two scale parameters is emphasized: a local scale, for describing the amount of smoothing used for suppressing noise and irrelevant details when computing primitive texture descriptors from image data; and an integration scale, for describing the size of the region in space over which the statistics of the local descriptors is accummulated. The proposed computational model is expressed completely in terms of different invariants defined from Gaussian derivatives at multiple scales in scale-space. The resulting texture description can be combined with various assumptions about surface texture to estimate local surface orientation. Two specific assumptions, weak isotropy and constant area, are explored in more detail. Results from experiments on real and synthetic reference data with known geometry that demonstrate the viability of the approach are presented.<<ETX>>"

It is shown that starting from Gaussian derivatives of order up to two at a range of scales in scale-space, local estimates of (i) surface orientation from monocular perspective texture foreshortening, (ii) surface orientation or curvature from monocular texture gradients, and (iii) surface orientation from the binocular disparity gradient can be computed without iteration or search, and by using essentially the same basic mechanism. The methodology is based on a multi-scale descriptor of image structure called the windowed second moment matrix, which is computed with adaptive selection of both scale levels and spatial positions. Notably, this descriptor comprises two scale parameters, a local scale describing the amount of smoothing used in derivative computations, and an integration scale determining over how large a region in space the statistics of local descriptors is accumulated. Experimental results for both synthetic and natural images are presented, and the relation with models of biological vision is brie y discussed.

The geometric information content of the gradient of binocular disparity is analyzed for the general case of a fixating system with symmetric or asymmetric vergence, and with either known or unknown viewing geometry. A computationally inexpensive technique which exploits this analysis is proposed. This technique allows a local estimate of surface orientation to be computed directly from the local statistics of the left and right image brightness gradients, without iterations or search. The viability of the approach is demonstrated with experimental results for both synthetic and natural gray-level images."

It relies on the foreshortening that occurs in the image of an oriented surface, and the analogous foreshortening produced in the texture autocorrelation function. This method assumes textural isotropy, but does not require the texture to be composed of texels or assume texture regularities such as equal-area texels or equal spacing between texels. This technique is applied to natural images of planar textured surfaces and found to give good results in many instances. The simplicity of the method and its use of information from all parts of the image are emphasized.<<ETX>>"

The so-called structure-from-motion problem is to infer the structure of these spatial configurations from the sequence of projections. For rigid transformations, a unique metrical reconstruction is known to be possible from three orthographic views of four points. However, human observers seem able to obtain much shape information from a mere pair of views, as is evident in the case of binocular stereo. Moreover, human observers seem to find little use for the information provided by additional views, even though some improvement certainly occurs. The rigidity requirement in its strict form is also relaxed. We indicate how solutions of the structure-from-motion problem can be stratified in such a way that one explicitly knows at which stages various a priori assumptions enter and specific geometrical expertise is required. An affine stage is identified at which only smooth deformation is assumed (thus no rigidity constraint is involved) and no metrical concepts are required. This stage allows one to find the spatial configuration (modulo an affinity) from two views. The addition of metrical methods allows one to find shape from two views, modulo a relief transformation (depth scaling and shear). The addition of a third view then merely serves to settle the calibration. Results of a numerical experiment are discussed."

It is well known that under a weak perspective the image motion of points on a plane can be characterized by an affine transformation. It is shown that the relative image motion of a nearby non-coplanar point and its projection on the plane is equivalent to motion parallax, and because it is independent of view rotations it is a reliable geometric cue to 3-D shape and viewer/object motion. The authors summarize why structure from motion algorithms are often very sensitive to errors in the measured image velocities and then show how to efficiently and reliably extract an incomplete qualitative solution. They also show how to augment this into a complete solution if additional constraints or views are available. A real-time example is presented in which the 3-D visual interpretation of hand gestures or a hand-held object is used as part of a man-machine interface. This is an alternative to the Polhemus coil instrumented Dataglove commonly used in sensing manual gestures.<<ETX>>"

Indeed, human stereopsis may possess a mechanism that specifically makes use of these orientation and spatial frequency disparities, in addition to the usual cue of horizontal disparity. In machine vision algorithms, orientation and spatial frequency disparities are a source of error in finding stereo correspondence because one seeks to find features or areas which are similar in the two views when, in fact, they are systematically different. In other words, it is common to treat as noise what is useful signal."

As the region boundaries in the approach remain sharp, a high-quality edge detector which successfully exploits global information is obtained. Experimental results are shown on a number of images.

We discuss these requirements and classify them into three categories: \u201carchitectural requirements\u201d like locality, recursivity and causality in the scale space, \u201cstability requirements\u201d like the comparison principle and \u201cmorphological requirements\u201d, which correspond to shape-preserving properties (rotation invariance, scale invariance, etc.). A complete classification is given of all image multiscale transforms satisfying these requirements. This classification yields a characterization of all classical models and includes new ones, which all are partial differential equations. The new models we introduce have more invariance properties than all the previously known models and in particular have a projection invariance essential for shape recognition. Numerical experiments are presented and compared. The same method is applied to the multiscale analysis of movies. By introducing a property of Galilean invariance, we find a single multiscale morphological model for movie analysis."

This result can be generalized to apply to level crossings of any linear differential operator: it applies in particular to ridges and ravines in the image intensity.

A genuinely discrete scale-space theory is developed and its connection to the continuous scale-space theory is explained. Special attention is given to discretization effects, which occur when results from the continuous scale-space theory are to be implemented computationally. The 1D problem is solved completely in an axiomatic manner. For the 2D problem, the author discusses how the 2D discrete scale space should be constructed. The main results are as follows: the proper way to apply the scale-space theory to discrete signals and discrete images is by discretization of the diffusion equation, not the convolution integral; the discrete scale space obtained in this way can be described by convolution with the kernel, which is the discrete analog of the Gaussian kernel, a scale-space implementation based on the sampled Gaussian kernel might lead to undesirable effects and computational problems, especially at fine levels of scale; the 1D discrete smoothing transformations can be characterized exactly and a complete catalogue is given; all finite support 1D discrete smoothing transformations arise from repeated averaging over two adjacent elements (the limit case of such an averaging process is described); and the symmetric 1D discrete smoothing kernels are nonnegative and unimodal, in both the spatial and the frequency domain. >"
