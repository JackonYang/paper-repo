Recently, a number of authors have demonstrated good performance on this task using methods that are based on eigenvectors of the affinity matrix. These approaches are extremely attractive in that they are based on simple eigendecomposition algorithms whose stability is well understood. Nevertheless, the use of eigendecompositions in the context of segmentation is far from well understood. In this paper we give a unified treatment of these algorithms, and show the close connections between them while highlighting their distinguishing features. We then prove results on eigenvectors of block matrices that allow us to analyze the performance of these algorithms in simple grouping settings. Finally, we use our analysis to motivate a variation on the existing methods that combines aspects from different eigenvector segmentation algorithms. We illustrate our analysis with results on real and synthetic images."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

The clusters emerge as quasi-stable structures during this relaxation, and then are extracted using the information bottleneck method.

This formulation differs in two ways from the most frequently considered clustering problems in the literature, namely, here we have k fixed and m, n variable, and we use the sum of squared distances as our measure; we will argue that our problem is natural in many contexts. We consider a relaxation of the discrete problem: find the k-dimensional subspace V so that the sum of distances squared to V (of the m points) is minimized. We show: (i) The relaxation can be solved by the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of Linear Algebra. (ii) The solution of the relaxation can be used to get a 2-approximation algorithm for the original problem. More importantly, (iii) we argue that in fact the relaxation provides a generalized clustering which is useful in its own right. Finally, (iv) we show that the SVD of a randomly chosen submatrix (according to a suitable probability distribution) of the matrix provides an approximation to the SVD of the whole matrix, thus yielding a very fast randomized algorithm. This cam be applied to problems of very large size which typically arise in modern applications."

The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents (\u201csemantic structure\u201d) in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising."
