                "text": "An enormous amount of knowledge is needed to infer the meaning of unrestricted natural language. The problem can be reduced to a manageable size by restricting attention to a specific {\\em domain}, which is a corpus of texts together with a predefined set of {\\em concepts} that are of interest to that domain. Two widely different domains are used to illustrate this domain-specific approach. One domain is a collection of Wall Street Journal articles in which the target concept is management succession events: identifying persons moving into corporate management positions or moving out. A second domain is a collection of hospital discharge summaries in which the target concepts are various classes of diagnosis or symptom. The goal of an information extraction system is to identify references to the concept of interest for a particular domain. A key knowledge source for this purpose is a set of text analysis rules based on the vocabulary, semantic classes, and writing style peculiar to the domain. This thesis presents CRYSTAL, an implemented system that automatically induces domain-specific text analysis rules from training examples. CRYSTAL learns rules that approach the performance of hand-coded rules, are robust in the face of noise and inadequate features, and require only a modest amount of training data. CRYSTAL belongs to a class of machine learning algorithms called covering algorithms, and presents a novel control strategy with time and space complexities that are independent of the number of features. CRYSTAL navigates efficiently through an extremely large space of possible rules. CRYSTAL also demonstrates that expressive rule representation is essential for high performance, robust text analysis rules. While simple rules are adequate to capture the most salient regularities in the training data, high performance can only be achieved when rules are expressive enough to reflect the subtlety and variability of unrestricted natural language."

                "text": "The WorldWideWeb is less agent-friendly than we might hope. Most information on the Web is presented in loosely structured natural language text with no agent-readable semantics. HTML annotations structure the display of Web pages, but provide virtually no insight into their content. Thus, the designers of intelligent Web agents need to address the following questions: (1) To what extent can an agent understand information published at Web sites? (2) Is the agent's understanding sufficient to provide genuinely useful assistance to users? (3) Is site-specific hand-coding necessary, or can the agent automatically extract information from unfamiliar Web sites? (4) What aspects of the Web facilitate this competence? In this paper we investigate these issues with a case study using ShopBot, a fully-implemented, domainindependent comparison-shopping agent. Given the home pages of several online stores, ShopBot autonomously learns how to shop at those vendors. After learning, it is able to speedily visit over a dozen software and CD vendors, extract product information, and summarize the results for the user. Preliminary studies show that ShopBot enables users to both find superior prices and substantially reduce Web shopping time. Remarkably, ShopBot achieves this performance without sophisticated natural language processing, and requires only minimal knowledge about different product domains. Instead, ShopBot relies on a combination of heuristic search, pattern matching, and inductive learning techniques.

For the Named Entity task, SRA adapted a subset of NameTag's capabilities to the MUC-6 specification. For the Template Element task, SRA fed the full results of NameTag into HASTEN, which performed additional processing to extract and generate the organization and person templates. For the Scenario Template task, SRA fed NameTag's results into HASTEN, which used its full extraction capabilities to extract and generate the management succession templates. Figure 1 illustrates the contribution of each system to the MUC-6 tasks. Due to the relative complexity of the scenario template task, this paper will focus on HASTEN and the experimental results for scenario extraction, and will provide brief descriptions of NameTag and the other tasks."
