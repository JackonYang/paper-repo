                "text": "A comprehensive and stimulating study which presents the views of 71 leading theorists on the underlying mechanisms and functions of the primary visual cortex. Current methodological strategies for model building and assessment, suitable for dealing with relatively simple physical systems appear inadequate to cope with the more complex, self- organising, goal-directed systems studied in the behavioural and brain sciences. This book does not attempt to elucidate a definite 'correct' model of the visual cortex but rather reflects differences in people's ideas and preconceptions about the overall function of the visual system and deeper issues about scientific goals and methods. The chapters are placed in approximate (but by no means monotonic) order of level of description, starting with overall function and running through to detailed microanatomy, and are only mathematically rigorous to the level of calculus. The final chapters suggesting directions for future research place in context a fascinating area of study which will continue to interest psychologists, physiologists, anatomists, neuroscientists, cyberneticians and researchers in artificial intelligence for many years to come."

The chapters are original essays and research reports that span a wide range of disciplinary approaches - from experimental psychophysics and psychobiology to mathematical analysis, to a spectrum of problems in visual processing. Further subjects covered include how the earliest stages of processing visual signals takes place, what the role of visual attention focusing is, and the high level problem of how we recognize familiar objects. Theoretical and empirical explorations of such general issues as the complexity of visual processing and the representation of visual knowledge are undertaken."

This article explores three possible accounts based on (a) perceptual segregation, (b) conjunction detectors, and (c) inhibition controlled separately by two or more distractor features. Search rates for conjunctions of color, size, orientation, and direction of motion correlated closely with an independent measure of perceptual segregation. However, they appeared unrelated to the physiology of single-unit responses. Each dimension contributed additively to conjunction search rates, suggesting that each was checked independently of the others. Unknown targets appear to be found only by serial search for each in turn. Searching through 4 sets of distractors was slower than searching through 2. The results suggest a modification of feature integration theory, in which attention is controlled not only by a unitary \"window\" but also by a form of feature-based inhibition. Language: en"

A variety of ana\u00ad tomical and physiological approaches have been employed to analyze the organization of thc visual pathway between the retina and striate cortex (VI ) and the transformations of visual information that occur at each stage (see Hubel & Wiesel 1977, Stone 1 983, Shapley & Lennie 1985). The growth in understanding of the retinostriate pathway has been accompanied by increasing interest in visual processing in the expanse of extrastriate cortex beyond V I . Studies of extrastriate cortex in many spec\u00ad ies showed that it comprises a mosaic of visual areas that can be dis\u00ad tinguished by several anatomical and physiological criteria (reviewed by Kaas 1 978, Zeki 1 978, Cowey 1979, Van Essen 1 979, 1985, Wagor et al 1980, Tusa et al 1 98 1) . The literature in this field is large, and we do not attempt to review all relevant studies. Rather, we concern ourselves with three recent devel\u00ad opments that have yielded insight into information processing and flow within extrastriate cortex. The first of these is the convergence of ana tom-"

For a single dimension the target \u2018pops out\u2019 and the search time is independent of the number of irrelevant items in the set. For conjunctions, the search time increases as the set becomes larger. Thus, it seems that the visual system is incapable of conducting a parallel search over two stimulus dimensions simultaneously. Here we extend this conclusion for the conjunction of motion and colour, showing that it requires a serial search. We also report two exceptions: if one of the dimensions in a conjunctive search is stereoscopic disparity, a second dimension of either colour or motion can be searched in parallel."

A series of search experiments tested detection of targets distinguished from the distractors by differences on a single dimension. Our aim was to use the pattern of search latencies to infer which features are coded automatically in early vision. For each of 12 different dimensions, one or more pairs of contrasting stimuli were tested. Each member of a pair played the role of target in one condition and the role of distractor in the other condition. Many pairs gave rise to a marked asymmetry in search latencies, such that one stimulus in the pair was detected either through parallel processing or with small increases in latency as display size increased, whereas the other gave search functions that increased much more steeply. Targets denned by larger values on the quantitative dimensions of length, number, and contrast, by line curvature, by misaligned orientation, and by values that deviated from a standard or prototypical color or shape were detected easily, whereas targets defined by smaller values on the quantitative dimensions, by straightness, by frame-aligned orientation, and by prototypical colors or shapes required slow and apparently serial search. These values appear to be coded by default, as the absence of the contrasting values. We found no feature of line arrangements that allowed automatic, preattentive detection; nor did connectedness or containment\u2014the two examples of topological features that we tested. We interpret the results as evidence that focused attention to single items or to groups is required to reduce background activity when the Weber fraction distinguishing the pooled feature activity with displays containing a target and with displays containing only distractors is too small to allow reliable discrimination."

Here we report that this is not true for targets defined by a conjunction of the features movement and form. Detection of a moving X among randomly distributed moving Os and static Xs is parallel. Search is uninfluenced by the stationary stimuli despite their spatial intermingling with the moving items. Thus, attention can be restricted to a spatially dispersed perceptual group, defined by common movement. This contradicts previous conclusions from visual search experiments4,5 that attention can only be assigned to contiguous regions of visual space. The search process first segregates the array into moving and stationary items, and then examines the moving group for the target form. Cells in the middle temporal region (cortical area MT) have the properties required to perform these operations6,7."

Having more visual areas probably increases visual abilities, perhaps in part by allowing more stimulus parameters to be considered. Proposals that each visual area computes and thereby detects a specific stimulus attribute have so far dealt with attributes that most mammals can detect and thus do not relate to the issue of species differences in numbers of areas. The problem of forming and maintaining complex patterns of interconnections between many different sets of distinct processing models within an area may limit multiplying functions within a field. In addition, the adding of new visual areas is a way of avoiding constraints on modifying existing visual areas that are imposed by the ongoing functional requirements. Thus, increasing the number of visual or other cortical areas is an effective and apparently common mechanism for evolving new capacities."

It deals with the visual mechanisms of diverse vertebrate species from salamanders and toads to primates and humans and presents a stimulating interaction of the disciplines of anatomy, physiology, and behavioral science. Throughout, visual mechanisms are investigated from the point of view of the brain functioning at the organismic level, as opposed to the now more prevalent focus on the molecular and cellular levels. This approach allows researchers to deal with the patterns of visually guided behavior of animals in real-life situations.The twenty-six contributions in the book are divided among three sections: \"Indentification and Localization Processes in Nonmammalian Vertebrates,\" introduced by David J. Ingle; \"Visual Guidance of Motor Patterns: The Role of Visual Cortex and the Superior Colliculus,\" introduced by Melvyn A. Goodale; and \"Recognition and Transfer Processes,\" introduced by Richard J. W. Mansfield.The editors are all university researchers in psychology: David J. Ingle at Brandeis, Melvyn A. Goodale at the University of Western Ontario, and Richard J. W. Mansfield at Harvard."

                "text": "We perceive the visual world as a unitary whole, yet one of the guiding principles of nearly a half century of neurophysiological research since the early recordings by Hartline (1938) has been that the visual system consists of neurons that are driven by stimulation within small discrete portions of the total visual field. These classical receptive fields (CRFs) have been mapped with the excitatory responses evoked by a flashed or moving stimulus, usually a spot or bar of light. Most of the visual neurons, in turn, are organized in a series of maps of the visual field, at least 10 of which exist in the visual cortex in primates as well as additional topographic representations in the lateral geniculate body, pulvinar and optic tectum (Allman 1977, Newsome & Allman 1980, Allman & Kaas 1984). It has been widely assumed that perceptual functions that require the integration of inputs over large portions of the visual field must be either collective properties of arrays of neurons representing the visual field, or features of those neurons at the highest processing levels in the visual system, such as the cells in inferotemporal or posterior parietal cortex that typically possess very large receptive fields and do not appear to be organized in visuotopic maps. These assumptions have been based on the results of the many studies in which receptive fields were mapped with conventional stimuli, presented one at a time, against a featureless background. However, unlike the neurophysiologist's tangent screen, the natural visual scene is rich in features, and there is a growing body of evidence that in many visual neurons stimuli presented outside the CRF strongly and selectively influence neural responses to stimuli presented within the CRF. These results suggest obvious mechanisms for local-global comparisons within visuotopically organized structures. Such broad and specific surround mechanisms could participate in many functions that require the integration of inputs over wide regions of the visual space such as the perceptual constancies, the segregation of figure from ground, and depth perception through motion parallax. In the first section of this paper, we trace the historical development of the evidence of response selectivity for visual stimuli presented beyond the CRF; in the second, examine the anatomical pathways that sub serve these far-reaching surround mechanisms; and in the third, explore the possible relationships between these mechanisms and perception."

Treisman and Gelade proposed a feature-integration theory of attention, which claims that in the absence of prior knowledge, the separable features of objects are correctly combined only when focused attention is directed to each item in turn. If items are preattentively grouped, however, attention may be directed to groups rather than to single items whenever no recombination of features within a group could generate an illusory target. This prediction is confirmed: In search for conjunctions, subjects appear to scan serially between groups rather than items. The scanning rate shows little effect of the spatial density of distractors, suggesting that it reflects serial fixations of attention rather than eye movements. Search for features, on the other hand, appears to independent of perceptual grouping, suggesting that features are detected preattentively. A conjunction target can be camouflaged at the preattentive level by placing it at the boundary between two adjacent groups, each of which shares one of its features. This suggests that preattentive grouping creates separate feature maps within each separable dimension rather than one global configuration."

Results support neither a distinction between serial and parallel search nor between search for features and conjunctions. For all search materials, instead, difficulty increases with increased similarity of targets to nontargets and decreasedsimilarity between nontargets, producing a continuum of search efficiency. A parallel stage of perceptual grouping and description is followed by competitive interaction between inputs, guiding selective access to awareness and action. An input gains weight to the extent that it matches an internal description of that information needed in current behavior (hence the effect of targetnontarget similarity). Perceptual grouping encourages input weights to change together (allowing \"spreading suppression\" of similar nontargets). The theory accounts for harmful effects of nontargets resembling any possible target, the importance of local nontarget grouping, and many other findings."

Two studies are reported which suggest that, while certain aspects of attention require that locations be scanned serially, at least one operation may be carried out in parallel across several independent loci in the visual field. That is the operation of indexing features and tracking their identity. The studies show that: (a) subjects are able to track a subset of up to 5 objects in a field of 10 identical randomly-moving objects in order to distinguish a change in a target from a change in a distractor; and (b) when the speed and distance parameters of the display are designed so that, on the basis of some very conservative assumptions about the speed of attention movement and encoding times, the predicted performance of a serial scanning and updating algorithm would not exceed about 40% accuracy, subjects still manage to do the task with 87% accuracy. These findings are discussed in relation to an earlier, and independently motivated model of feature-binding--called the FINST model--which posits a primitive identity maintenance mechanism that indexes and tracks a limited number of visual objects in parallel. These indexes are hypothesized to serve the function of binding visual features prior to subsequent pattern recognition."

Support for this comes from studies in which subjects searched for a target that shared a single feature with each of two different kinds of distractor items (e.g., a red O in a field of black Os and red Ns). Reaction time increased linearly with display size. We argue that this design may obscure evidence of selectivity in search. In an experiment in which the numbers of the two distractors were unconfounded, we find evidence that subjects can search through specified subsets of stimuli. For example, subjects told to search through just the Os to find the red O target do so without searching through Ns. Implications of selective search are discussed."

Set size was varied and reaction times (RT) were measured. For many unpracticed subjects, the slopes of the resulting RT X Set Size functions are too shallow to be consistent with Treisman's feature integration model, which proposes serial, self-terminating search for conjunctions. Searches for triple conjunctions (Color X Size X Form) are easier than searches for standard conjunctions and can be independent of set size. A guided search model similar to Hoffman's (1979) two-stage model can account for these data. In the model, parallel processes use information about simple features to guide attention in the search for conjunctions. Triple conjunctions are found more efficiently than standard conjunctions because three parallel processes can guide attention more effectively than two."

                "text": "Of the many possible functions of the macaque monkey primary visual cortex (striate cortex, area 17) two are now fairly well understood. First, the incoming information from the lateral geniculate bodies is rearranged so that most cells in the striate cortex respond to specifically oriented line segments, and, second, information originating from the two eyes converges upon single cells. The rearrangement and convergence do not take place immediately, however: in layer IVc, where the bulk of the afferents terminate, virtually all cells have fields with circular symmetry and are strictly monocular, driven from the left eye or from the right, but not both; at subsequent stages, in layers above and below IVc, most cells show orientation specificity, and about half are binocular. In a binocular cell the receptive fields in the two eyes are on corresponding regions in the two retinas and are identical in structure, but one eye is usually more effective than the other in influencing the cell; all shades of ocular dominance are seen. These two functions are strongly reflected in the architecture of the cortex, in that cells with common physiological properties are grouped together in vertically organized systems of columns. In an ocular dominance column all cells respond preferentially to the same eye. By four independent anatomical methods it has been shown that these columns have the form of vertically disposed alternating left-eye and right-eye slabs, which in horizontal section form alternating stripes about 400 \u03bcm thick, with occasional bifurcations and blind endings. Cells of like orientation specificity are known from physiological recordings to be similarly grouped in much narrower vertical sheeet-like aggregations, stacked in orderly sequences so that on traversing the cortex tangentially one normally encounters a succession of small shifts in orientation, clockwise or counterclockwise; a 1 mm traverse is usually accompanied by one or several full rotations through 180\u00b0, broken at times by reversals in direction of rotation and occasionally by large abrupt shifts. A full complement of columns, of either type, left-plus-right eye or a complete 180\u00b0 sequence, is termed a hypercolumn. Columns (and hence hypercolumns) have roughly the same width throughout the binocular part of the cortex. The two independent systems of hypercolumns are engrafted upon the well known topographic representation of the visual field. The receptive fields mapped in a vertical penetration through cortex show a scatter in position roughly equal to the average size of the fields themselves, and the area thus covered, the aggregate receptive field, increases with distance from the fovea. A parallel increase is seen in reciprocal magnification (the number of degrees of visual field corresponding to 1 mm of cortex). Over most or all of the striate cortex a movement of 1-2 mm, traversing several hypercolumns, is accompanied by a movement through the visual field about equal in size to the local aggregate receptive field. Thus any 1-2 mm block of cortex contains roughly the machinery needed to subserve an aggregate receptive field. In the cortex the fall-off in detail with which the visual field is analysed, as one moves out from the foveal area, is accompanied not by a reduction in thickness of layers, as is found in the retina, but by a reduction in the area of cortex (and hence the number of columnar units) devoted to a given amount of visual field: unlike the retina, the striate cortex is virtually uniform morphologically but varies in magnification. In most respects the above description fits the newborn monkey just as well as the adult, suggesting that area 17 is largely genetically programmed. The ocular dominance columns, however, are not fully developed at birth, since the geniculate terminals belonging to one eye occupy layer IVc throughout its length, segregating out into separate columns only after about the first 6 weeks, whether or not the animal has visual experience. If one eye is sutured closed during this early period the columns belonging to that eye become shrunken and their companions correspondingly expanded. This would seem to be at least in part the result of interference with normal maturation, though sprouting and retraction of axon terminals are not excluded."

Talbot & Marshall (1941) used physiological methods to map the central part of the visual field on to the posterolateral surface ofthe cortex in the monkey. They devised an index of cortical representation expressed as the increment of the angle, measured radially from the centre of gaze, which is represented on each millimetre of cortex. We have confirmed their observations and have extended the mapping to the buried visual cortex in the horizontal and vertical calcarine fissures. We have preferred to use the reciprocal of their index and to call it the cortical magnification, M. When this is measured along radii and at right angles to them, it provides the empirical quantitative relation which Polyak wanted. It also defines the shape and size of the visual receptive field. We have made such a surface, folded it and compared it with the calcarine cortex of the monkey. A preliminary account of this work has been published (Daniel & Whitteridge, 1959)."

One of the deepest mysteries of the function of cortex is that neural processing times are only about one hundred times as fast as the fastest response times for complex behavior. At the very least, this would seem to indicate that the cortex does massive amounts of parallel computation. This paper explores the hypothesis that an important part of the cortex can be modeled as a connectionist computer that is especially suited for parallel problem solving. The connectionist computer uses a special representation, termed value unit encoding, that represents small subsets of parameters in a way that allows parallel access to many different parameter values. This computer can be thought of as computing hierarchies of sensorimotor invariants. The neural substrate can be interpreted as a commitment to data structures and algorithms that compute invariants fast enough to explain the behavioral response times. A detailed consideration of this model has several implications for the underlying anatomy and physiology."

For example, the time required to find a circle distinguished by an intersecting line is independent of the number of regular circles in the display, whereas the time to find a regular circle among circles with lines increases linearly with the number of distractors. The pattern of performance suggests parallel processing when the target has a unique distinguishing feature and serial self-terminating search when the target is distinguished only by the absence of a feature that is present in all the distractors. The results are consistent with feature-integration theory (Treisman & Gelade, 1980), which predicts that a single feature should be detected by the mere presence of activity in the relevant feature map, whereas tasks that require subjects to locate multiple instances of a feature demand focused attention. Search asymmetries may therefore offer a new diagnostic to identify the primitive features of early vision. Several candidate features are examined in this article: Colors, line ends or terminators, and closure (in the sense of a partly or wholly enclosed area) appear to be functional features; connectedness, intactness (absence of an intersecting line), and acute angles do not."

When both locations were within the receptive field of a cell in prestriate area V4 or the inferior temporal cortex, the response to the unattended stimulus was dramatically reduced.

This assumption was tested by measuring the effects of visual imagery on concurrent visual perception. The experimental task consisted of a two-interval forced-choice detection task (no stimulus identification required) during which the subject imaged a particular stimulus. In Experiment 1, a matching image led to better detection than a nonmatching image. Interactions between imagery and perception imply a common locus of activity, and the content-specific interactions obtained here imply that the common locus consists of representational structures. In Experiment 2, a matching image facilitated perception only when the image and the stimulus were in the same position. This was taken to imply that the shared representational structures occur at an analog level of perceptual representation."

                "text": "A series of experiments are reported in which the comparative constraints on single-feature and conjunction searches were examined. The first three tested the idea that the critical differences between these searches reflect the number of stimulus attributes that subjects must extract to make a response, that is, one in the feature condition, two in the conjunction condition. Targets were defined by possible pairwise combinations of a color, a size, and a shape. In another condition, subjects searched for two simultaneously present feature targets. Search for these targets did not differ qualitatively from that for a single-feature target (i.e., search remained parallel), but there was a constant increment to feature search functions. The final experiment examined the possibility that the number of relevant shared features between targets and distractors may also be critical. The results showed that the number of relevant shared features affected the rate of search but not its nature. Thus, differences between feature and conjunction searches do not reflect the number of relevant stimulus attributes that must be detected, or the number of relevant features shared between targets and distractors. Nevertheless, evidence for attentional involvement was found when subjects searched for two simultaneously present features. This goes against the claim that differences between the two types of search occur because feature searches can be carried out preattentively, while only conjunction searches involve the serial application of focused attention. An account of visual search performance that emphasizes the fidelity of coding of target information seems a more adequate proposal."

                "text": "1. Recordings were made from single neurones, or small clusters of cells, in five prestriate visual areas of rhesus monkey cortex. The cells were studied for their binocularity, as well as for their orientational, motion and colour preferences. In all, 1500 cells were studied, 250 cells for each of the areas V2, V3, V3A and the motion area of the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus, and 500 cells for V4. All the cells referred to in this study can be placed in one prestriate area or another unambiguously. 2. The great majority of cells in all areas were binocularly driven, without monocular preferences. Within each area, there were cells that either preferred binocular stimulation markedly, or were responsive to binocular stimulation only. The ocular interaction histograms for all areas are remarkably similar when tested at a fixed disparity. 3. Over 70% of the cells in areas V2, V3 and V3A were selective for orientation. The receptive fields of cells were larger in V3 and V3A than in V2. By contrast, less than 50% of the cells in V4 and the motion area of the superior temporal sulcus were orientation selective. 4. Directionally selective cells were found in all areas. But they were present in small numbers (less than 15%) in areas V2, V3, V3A and V4. By contrast, 90% of the cells in the motion area of the superior temporal sulcus were directionally selective. 5. 8% of the cells in V2 had opponent colour properties. Cells with such properties were not found in V3, V3A or in the motion area of the superior temporal sulcus. By contrast, 54% of the cells in the V4 complex had opponent colour properties. 6. It is argued that despite its uniformity in cytoarchitectural appearance and in ocular interaction patterns, there is a functional division of labour within the prestriate cortex. Evidence for this is seen not only in the different concentrations of functional cell types in distinct areas of the prestriate cortex, but also in the differential anatomical and callosal connexions of each area."

Correcting errors of illusory conjunction is the \u201ctag-assignment\u201d problem for a purely parallel processor: the problem of assigning a spatial tag to nonspatial features, feature combinations, and objects. This problem must be solved to model human object recognition over a longer time scale. Our model simulates both the parallel processes that may underlie illusory conjunctions and the serial processes that may solve the tag-assignment problem in normal perception. One component of the model extracts pooled features and another provides attentional tags that correct illusory conjunctions. Our approach addresses two questions: (i) How can objects be identified from simultaneously attended features in a parallel, distributed representation? (ii) How can the spatial selectional requirements of such an attentional process be met by a separation of pathways for spatial and nonspatial processing? Our analysis of these questions yields a neurally plausible simulation of tag assignment based on synchronizing feature processing activity in a spatial focus of attention."

Posner (1984; in press) has proposed a framework for doing so in which elementary mental operations in cognitive models are expressed in terms of component facilitations and inhibitions in the performance of normal persons. Studies of brain-injured patients are used to link these components to underlying neural systems. In the area of spatial attention one such component is the tendency to inhibit orienting towards visual locations which have been previously attended (inhibition of return). Here we report studies in patients and normals which demonstrate the relationship of this component to neural systems which generate saccades. The first experiment showed that midbrain lesions impairing saccade generation produced a concurrent loss of the inhibition of return, whereas cortical components shown to impair facilitatory components did not. The second and third experiments show that the inhibition of return ..."

Chen's result was later synopsized for a large readership.' Here we reinterpret one of Chen's three experiments and comment on the other two. After successfully replicating Chen's first result, we added a condition in which we controlled for luminous flux. Data from our control condition suggest that Chen's findings were due to a confounding of luminous flux with topological factors. In Chen's first experiment, subjects were simultaneously shown a pair of figures and asked to respond \"same\" or \"different.\" (The correct answer was always \"different. ' ') Chen found that, under near-threshold conditions, a pair of topologically distinct figures (diskannulus) was more discriminable than pairs of topologically identical but geometrically distinct' figures (disksquare; disk-triangle). Chen concluded that the greater discriminability of the topologically distinct pair was due to the visual system's sensitivity to topological structure.\" However, the topological distinction was conflated with disparities in the luminous flux differences between the two figures of each pair. Indeed, the greater the flux difference, the better the discrimination. 4 To claim a visual sensitivity to topological properties, a pair of figures of different topology but identical flux must be shown to be highlydiscriminable in an experimental situation similar to Chen's. In an attempt to replicate Chen's results, we added such a control pair (Figure la). The black area of the annulus is identical to the black area of the topologically distinct disk-with-two-holes. Two other stimulus pairs (Figures lc and ld) are similar to Chen's. A fourth case, annulus-horseshoe (Figure lb), was added because it was topologically equivalent to the disk-annulus pair, yet had only a small (within-pair) difference in luminous flux. S Following Chen, we used 5-msec tachistoscopic presentation of the stimuli. Our displays closely matched Chen's in visual angle subtended.\" With five naive subjects, we replicated Chen's finding that discriminability of the diskannulus pair was significantly greater than that of the disksquare [t(4) = 2.9, P < .025V However, the control"

First, we carried out a quantitative analysis of irregularities and asymmetries in the visual representation in MT. This analysis revealed a striking overemphasis on a restricted portion of the visual field that runs obliquely through the inferior contralateral quadrant and largely avoids both the horizontal meridian and the inferior vertical meridian. This corresponds to the portion of the visual field that would be maximally stimulated during visually guided hand movements. Second, the physiologically determined topographic organization of MT was compared to the pattern of callosal inputs in the same hemisphere, which are known to be distributed irregularly within MT. Callosal inputs tended to be densest near the representation of the vertical meridian, but there were numerous exceptions to this trend. Thus, topographic irregularities account for only part of the irregularities in callosal inputs to MT. Finally, comparison of these data with previous reports shows a strong correlation between body weight and the average size of MT. The representation in myeloarchitectonically defined MT was found to include much of the visual periphery, although it is unclear from our data whether this representation is invariably complete."

A set of constraints for sparse sensory data that are applicable to a wide variety of sensors are derived, and their characteristics are examined. Known bounds on the complexity of constraint satisfaction problems are used, together with explicit estimates of the effectiveness of the constraints derived for the case of sparse, noisy, three-dimensional sensory data, to obtain general theoretical bounds on the number of interpretations expected to be consistent with the data. It is shown that these bounds are consistent with empirical results reported previously.

The novel feature of this study was that there were frequently two targets in the list; the occurrence of the first target disrupted identification of the second for a subsequent period of more than half a second. This happened whether the target word was designated by a single physical feature or by the semantic characteristic of belonging to a specified category. The two situations did differ, however, in that unidentified targets of the first type still disturbed an accompanying second target, whereas those of the second type did not. The results are interpreted as meaning that a simple undemanding process of detection triggers other and more demanding processes of identification, so that the occurrence of the latter for one target interferes with their occurrence for another."

The neuronal firing pattern is tightly correlated with the phase and amplitude of an oscillatory local field potential recorded through the same electrode. The amplitude of the local field-potential oscillations are maximal in response to stimuli that match the orientation and direction preference of the local cluster of neurons. Single and multiunit recordings from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus showed no evidence of oscillations of the neuronal firing probability in the range of 20-70 Hz. The results demonstrate that local neuronal populations in the visual cortex engage in stimulus-specific synchronous oscillations resulting from an intracortical mechanism. The oscillatory responses may provide a general mechanism by which activity patterns in spatially separate regions of the cortex are temporally coordinated."

Whereas interactionism stresses the continuity of perceptual and cognitive processes, modularity theory argues for their distinctness. It is argued, in particular, that the apparent plausibility of New Look theorizing derives from the failure to distinguish between the (correct) claim that perceptual processes are inferential and the (dubious) claim that they are unencapsidated, that is, that they are arbitrarily sensitive to the organism's beliefs and desires. In fact, according to modularity theory, perceptual processes are computationally isolated from much of the background knowledge to which cognitive processes have access. The postulation of autonomous, domain-specific psychological mechanisms underlying perceptual integration connects modularity theory with the tradition of faculty psychology, in particular, with the work of Franz Joseph Call. Some of these historical affinities, and some of the relations between faculty psychology and Cartesianism, are discussed in the book."

Behavioral evidence indicated that the monkeys' discriminative abilities improved when the task was made more difficult. Correspondingly, neuronal responses to stimuli became larger and more selective in the difficult task. A control experiment demonstrated that changes in general arousal could not account for the effects of task difficulty on neuronal responses. It is concluded that increasing the amount of attention directed toward a stimulus can enhance the responsiveness and selectivity of the neurons that process it."

Evidence from our EEG research on the olfactory bulb suggests that the brain may indeed use computational mechanisms like those found in connectionist models. In the present paper we discuss our data and develop a model to describe the neural dynamics responsible for odor recognition and discrimination. The results indicate the existence of sensory- and motor-specific information in the spatial dimension of EEG activity and call for new physiological metaphors and techniques of analysis. Special emphasis is placed in our model on chaotic neural activity. We hypothesize that chaotic behavior serves as the essential ground state for the neural perceptual apparatus, and we propose a mechanism for acquiring new forms of patterned activity corresponding to new learned odors. Finally, some of the implications of our neural model for behavioral theories are briefly discussed. Our research, in concert with the connectionist work, encourages a reevaluation of explanatory models that are based only on the digital computer metaphor."

Computer analysis of these data provided detailed, quantitative information concerning the amount, variability, and distribution of the striate area on the surface of the occipital lobe, and within the calcarine fissure and other sulci. This information is particularly applicable to the development of a functional visual prosthesis for the blind based on stimulation of the visual cortex. Taking conservative values for two-point discrimination (3 mm) on the cortex based on previous observations made during neurosurgical operations, and the surgically accessible areas available for stimulation reported in this study, it seems clear that a useful number of electrodes could be implanted in virtually every patient."

Levels of excitability were measured as the intensity of response to optimal visual stimuli placed in the most responsive region of the cell's receptive field. Physically and retinotopically identical stimuli were delivered during eye movement pauses under 3 conditions: during a no-task state in which the animal was awake and alert, but not receiving or expecting rewards or working in any task; between trials of the task state, the intertrial interval, while the animal awaited the appearance of a fixation target; and during the foreperiod of the task state, as the animal attentively fixated a small target light, waiting to detect its dimming in order to receive liquid reward. Experiments were carried out in 6 hemispheres of 4 monkeys; both V4 and PG were examined through the same chamber placements in 2 hemispheres. A total of 478 neurons in V4 and PG were identified as visual; quantitative studies were done on 146 in V4 and 54 in PG. We found in these experiments a common effect, a 3\u2013 4-fold facilitation of the responses of both V4 and PG visual neurons during the task state as compared to in the no-task state, and a differential effect, in that V4 neurons showed a similar 3-4-fold facilitation of responses to stimuli presented during the intertrial interval, whereas PG neuronal responses during this interval were similar to those evoked in the no-task state. We describe the functional properties of V4 neurons studied in the waking state. The findings are discussed in relation to the positions of these 2 areas in the occipitoparietal and occipitotemporal transcortical visual systems and to their respective roles in visuospatial perception and pattern recognition. They are also discussed with regard to the candidate neural mechanisms through which the changes in cortical neuronal excitability might be mediated."

This result is perplexing because same, but not different, judgments would seem to require full and exhaustive processing. Some models have depicted same processing as more efficient or powerful than different processing due to an identity reporter or to priming. When accuracy rather than reaction time (RT) is examined, however, same processing looks generally less efficient than different processing: Subjects are more likely to make false different responses to same pairs than false same responses to different pairs. The present noisy-operator theory holds that internal noise is more likely to produce spurious featural mismatches than matches and that the rechecking needed to remove these spurious differences produces the typically longer RT for different judgments. Data from comparisons of single-patter n (Cases 1, 2, and 3) or multiletter strings (Cases 4, 5, and 6) were fitted to a single-processor accumulative model based on the theory. This report deals with a deceptively simple task. A person is shown two patterns, either side by side or one after the other, and must decide as rapidly (and accurately) as possible whether they are identical or not. Trials are randomly intermixed, of course, so that the subject never knows beforehand whether he will see a same or different pair. The matching processes involved in this simple task are im"

The increased efficiency in detecting sameness with sequential presentation might result from spatial separation (e.g., reduced lateral interference and self-termination), though, rather than temporal separation (e.g., priming), However, such spatial factors as letter size and interletter spacing had no consistent effect on the speed advantage forsame pairs, and it was concluded that temporal, not spatial, separation enhances the fast-same effect on sequential trials, Consistent with the response-competition model (Eriksen, O\u2019Hara, & Eriksen), responses were slower and more errorful to similar than to dissimilardifferent pairs, and were equally fast to dissimilar andsame pairs on simultaneous trials."

                "text": "THE DISCHARGES carried in the optic nerve fibers contain all the information which the central nervous system receives from the retina. A correct interpretation of discharge patterns therefore constitutes an important step in the analysis of visual events. Further, investigations of nervous activity arising in the eye reveal many aspects of the functional organization of the neural elements within the retina itself. Following studies of discharges in the optic nerve of the eel\u2019s eye by Adrian and Matthews (2,3), Hartline and his colleagues described the discharge pattern in the eye of the Limulus in a series of important and lucid papers (for a summary see 20). In the Limulus the relationship between the stimulus to the primary receptor cell and the nerve discharges proved relatively simple, apparently because the connection between sense cell and nerve fiber was a direct one. Thus, when stimulation is confined to one receptor the discharge in a single Limulus nerve fiber will provide a good indication of excitatory events which take place as a result of photochemical processes. Discharges last for the duration of illumination and their frequency is a measure of stimulus strength. Lately, however, it was shown by Hartline et al. (22) that inhibitory interactions may be revealed when several receptors are excited. On the whole, the Limulus preparation shows many features which are similar to other simple sense organs, for instance, stretch receptors. In the latter, however, instead of photochemical events, stretch-deformation acts as the adequate stimulus on sensory terminals and is translated into a characteristic discharge pattern. The discharge from the cold-blooded vertebrate retina (mainly frogs) proved much more complex. Hartline found three main types when recording from single optic nerve fibers: (i) \u201con\u201d discharges, similar to those in the Limulus, firing for the duration of the light stimulus, (ii) \u201coff\u201d discharges appearing when a light stimulus was withdrawn, and (iii) \u2018con-off\u201d discharges, a combination of the former two, with activity confined mainly to onset and cessation of illumination. The mammalian discharge patterns were studied in a number of species by Granit and his co-workers in the course of their extensive work on the physiology of the visual system (summaries in 13, 15). On the whole, they did not observe any fundamental differences between frog and mammalian discharge types (see later)."

This result is widely accepted as evidence that a serial self-terminating search is necessary to detect conjunctions. In Experiment 1 of the present study, the subjects searched for a conjunction target (a green T) in displays of 2, 4, or 8 items. Positive and negative display-size slopes were essentially the same in this range. In Experiment 2, the subjects searched for conjunction targets in displays of 2 to 24 items. In displays of 2 to 8 items, the positive and negative slopes were again comparable and the 2:1 ratio was again rejected. In displays of 8 to 24 items, on the other hand, the negative slopes were approximately twice the positive slopes. The same result was obtained in Experiment 3, which was modeled after the conjunction search experiment of Egeth, Virzi, and Garbart (1984). In summary, a 2\\3n1 slope ratio appears to describe the function quite well in the range above 8 items (or if display size is coarsely sampled, as in previous research), but not in the lower range, in which the true ratio is closer to 1\\3n1. These nearly parallel functions in the lower range probably do not, however, reflect a serial exhaustive search: in Experiment 4, positive reaction times were substantially reduced when redundant targets were added to the display. An alternative model of conjunction search is proposed on the basis of these data. This model postulates a molar serial self-terminating search over relatively large clumps of items, and a parallel search within these clumps. It appears, then, that the nature of the attentional limits arising in the process of feature conjunction must be very different from that suggested by Treisman and Gelade."

                "text": "In recent decades, the question of whether a machine can think has been given a different interpretation entirely. The question that has been posed in its place is, Could a machine think just by virtue of implementing a computer program Is the program by itself constitutive of thinking This is a completely different question because it is not about the physical, causal properties of actual or possible physical systems but rather about the abstract, computational properties of formal computer programs that can be implemented in any sort of substance at all, provided only that the substance is able to carry the program. A fair number of researchers in artificial intelligence (AI) believe the answer to the second question is yes. They believe further-more that they have a scientific test for determining success or failure: the Turing test devise by Alan M. Turing, the founding father of artificial intelligence. The Turing test, as currently understood, is simply this: if a computer can perform is such a way that an expert cannot distinguish its performance from that of a human who has a certain cognitive ability-say, the ability to do addition or to understand Chinese - then the computer also has thatmore\u00a0\u00bb ability. So the goal is to design programs that will simulate human cognition in such a way as to pass the Turing test. What is more, such a program would not merely be a model of the mind; it would literally be a mind, in the same sense that a human mind is a mind. By no means does every worker in artificial intelligence accept so extreme a view. A more cautious approach is to think of computer models as being useful in studying the mind in the same way that they are useful in studying the weather, economics or molecular biology. To distinguish these two approaches, the authors call the first strong AI and the second weak AI. It is important to see just how bold an approach strong AI is.\u00ab\u00a0less"

In general, we found that the event name itself combined most readily with superordinate noun categories; thus, one gets dressed with clothes and needs various kitchen utensils to make breakfast. When such activities were analyzed into their script elements, the basic level appeared as the level of abstraction of objects necessary to script the events; e.g., in getting dressed, one puts on pants, sweater, and shoes, and in making breakfast, one cooks eggs in a frying pan. With respect to prototypes, it appears to be those category members judged the more prototypical that have attributes that enable them to fit into the typical and agreed upon script elements. We are presently collecting normative data on the intersection of common events, the objects associated with those events and the other sets of events associated with those objects.2 In addition, object names for eliciting events are varied in level of abstraction and in known prototypicality in given categories. Initial results show a similar pattern to that obtained in the earlier research in which it was found that the more typical members of superordinate categories could replace the superordinate in sentence frames generated by subjects told to \"make up a sentence\" that used the superordinate (Rosch, 1977). That is, the task of using a given concrete noun in a sentence appears to be an indirect method of eliciting a statement about the events in which objects play a part; that indirect method showed clearly that prototypical category members are those that can play the role in events expected of members of that category. The use of deviant forms of object names in narratives accounts for several recently explored effects in the psychological literature. Substituting object names at other than the basic level within scripts results in obviously deviant descriptions. Substitution of superordinates produces just those types of narrative that Bransford and Johnson (1973) have claimed are not comprehended; for example, \" The procedure is actually quite simple. First you arrange things into different groups. Of course, one pile may be sufficient [p. 400].\" It should be noted in the present context that what Bransford and Johnson call context cues are actually names of basic-level events (e.g., washing clothes) and that one function of hearing the event name is to enable the reader to translate the superordinate terms into basic-level objects and actions. Such a translation appears to be a necessary aspect of our ability to match linguistic descriptions to world knowledge in a way that produces the \"click of comprehension.\" On the other hand, substitution of subordinate terms for basic-level object names in scripts gives the effect of satire or snobbery. For example, a review ( Garis, 1975) of a pretentious novel accused of actually being about nothing more than brand-name snobbery concludes, \"And so, after putting away my 10"

The present article reports an experiment in which the relative bias to respondsame ordifferent was varied for matches of single-letter pairs. Bias was manipulated by having 80, 60, 40, or 20 pairs in a block of 100 besame, with the remainder beingdifferent. For both sequential and simultaneous presentation of the letters,same reaction times had an overall advantage overdifferent reaction times that could not be attributed to response bias. Moreover, consistent with Proctor\u2019s (1981) facilitation principle, this reaction time disparity was greater with sequential presentation than with simultaneous presentation. The larger reaction time advantage forsame pairs with sequential presentation was obtained without an increase in the relative number of false-same responses, supporting the view that the facilitation is attributable to changes in sensitivity and not to changes in encoding criteria."

Frequently, processes are needed which reduce ambiguity and noise, and select the best label among several possible choices. Relaxation labeling processes are just such a class of algorithms. They are based on the parallel use of local constraints between labels. This paper develops a theory to characterize the goal of relaxation labeling. The theory is founded on a definition of con-sistency in labelings, extending the notion of constraint satisfaction. In certain restricted circumstances, an explicit functional exists that can be maximized to guide the search for consistent labelings. This functional is used to derive a new relaxation labeling operator. When the restrictions are not satisfied, the theory relies on variational cal-culus. It is shown that the problem of finding consistent labelings is equivalent to solving a variational inequality. A procedure nearly identical to the relaxation operator derived under restricted circum-stances serves in the more general setting. Further, a local convergence result is established for this operator. The standard relaxation labeling formulas are shown to approximate our new operator, which leads us to conjecture that successful applications of the standard methods are explainable by the theory developed here. Observations about con-vergence and generalizations to higher order compatibility relations are described."

In contrast to the preponderance of false-different errors found using the same method without speed stress (Chignell & Krueger), there were more false-same responses, particularly on similardifferent pairs. The early, or developing, percept looks very similar from one letter to another, apparently because real differences between letters frequently are missed, whereas spurious differences due to missing or unresolved features at encoding or comparison are simply disregarded (missing-feature principle) rather than interpreted as featural mismatches (internal-noise principle).

                "text": "We consider first the three-dimensional wave equation. It is well known that the solution u(x, y, z, t) is uniquely determined by the initial conditions u and Ou/Ot at time t =0. We ask whether computable initial data can give rise to noncomputable solutions. The answer is \"yes.\" Theorem 2 below gives an example in which the solution u(x, y, z, t) takes a noncomputable value at a computable point in space-time. Theorem 3 is more delicate. It provides an example in which the solution maps each computable sequence of points into a computable sequence. Thus an experimenter, carrying out an arbitrary sequence of experiments programmed in advance, would obtain a computable sequence as his values. Nevertheless the function u is not computable. We note in passing that \"computability,\" as used in this paper, is a technical term familiar to logicians from recursion theory. The precise definitions are spelled out below. The noncomputable solutions discussed above are of the type commonly called \"weak solutions,\" i.e., although continuous, they are not twice differentiable at all points. Weak solutions describe shock waves and other nondifferentiable patterns which frequently appear in physical phenomena. The use of weak solutions is inevitable, for it can be proved that no C ~ solutions of the desired kind exist (Pour-E1 and Richards, 1981). We review here the standard definitions of computability as they apply to classical analysis. The notion of a computable or \"recursive\" function from the nonnegative integers into themselves will be assumed as known. Then a sequence (rn} of rational numbers is called \"recursive\" if there exist three recursive functions a(n), b(n), s(n) such that rn = ( 1)s(\")[a(n)/b(n)]."

                "text": "Appreciation of the form of the retinal image depends upon a correspondence between the distribution of light on the retina and the distribution of activity among the fibers of the optic nerve. This correspondence may be studied directly by recording the activity in single optic nerve fibers in response to illuminating various parts of the retina. A given optic nerve fiber responds to light only if a particular region of the retina receives illumination. This region is termed the receptive field of that fiber. In a previous paper describing the responses in single optic nerve fibers from the cold-blooded vertebrate eye (Hartline, 1938) it was noted that the receptive fields of the optic nerve fibers are of small but appreciable extent, and that their locations on the retina are fixed. It is the purpose of the present paper to describe further the characteristics of receptive fields, and to discuss some of the spatial factors involved in the excitation of the fibers of the optic nerve. METHOD. The method for recording the activity in single optic nerve fibers from the eyes of cold-blooded vertebrates has been described in the previous paper (lot. cit.). An eye is excised, cut open, and small bundles of optic nerve fibers are dissected from the anterior surface of the exposed retina. The action potentials in these bundles are amplified and recorded with an oscillograph. When such a bundle has been split successfully , until only a single active fiber remains, the retina must be searched with a small spot of light to determine the region supplying that fiber. This search is aided by noting the direction, on the retina, from which the nerve fibers in the small bundle come, and by using large spots of light at first to locate the approximate position of the sensitive region. The optical system employed in these experiments has likewise been described. A spot of light of suitable size is projected upon the exposed retina; the coordinates of its position, referred to an arbitrary point of origin on the retina, are obtained from readings of crossed micrometers which control its location. The micrometer readings are reduced to millimeters on the retina by multiplying them by the magnification of the optical system (0.32 or 0.15). Sharpness of focus of the spot on the retina 690"

These findings are consistent with the theory of neuronal group selection, a population theory of brain function that is based on the properties of local groups of neurons. A set of computer simulations shows that cooperative interactions within and among neuronal groups can generate the observed phenomena. In the simulations, oscillations within neuronal groups are generated through local excitatory and inhibitory interactions. Different groups in general oscillate in an uncorrelated fashion. Coherency of the oscillatory activity of different neuronal groups depends crucially on reciprocal reentrant signaling and can reflect the spatial continuity of a stimulus. Separated or discontinuous features of a given stimulus can be transiently associated in a temporally coherent pattern through reentrant signaling between groups in networks responding to different aspects of that stimulus. A simulation of reentrant activity between arrays of neuronal groups selective for oriented lines and pattern motion displays cross-correlations between groups that are responsive to different parts of a stimulus contour if these parts move together. Such coherency among neuronal groups might be used in the discrimination of a stimulus from other stationary or differentially moving elements in a visual scene."

The representation differs from established techniques in that the code elements are localized in spatial frequency as well as in space. Pixel-to-pixel correlations are first removed by subtracting a lowpass filtered copy of the image from the image itself. The result is a net data compression since the difference, or error, image has low variance and entropy, and the low-pass filtered image may represented at reduced sample density. Further data compression is achieved by quantizing the difference image. These steps are then repeated to compress the low-pass image. Iteration of the process at appropriately expanded scales generates a pyramid data structure. The encoding process is equivalent to sampling the image with Laplacian operators of many scales. Thus, the code tends to enhance salient image features. A further advantage of the present code is that it is well suited for many image analysis tasks as well as for image compression. Fast algorithms are described for coding and decoding."

In this paper we investigate the problem of optimal compression of propositional Horn production rule knowledge bases. The standard approach to this problem, consisting in the removal of redundant rules from a knowledge base, leads to an \"irredundant\" but not necessarily optimal knowledge base. We prove here that the number of rules in any irredundant Horn knowledge base involving n propositional variables is at most n 0 1 times the minimum possible number of rules. In order to formalize the optimal compression problem, we define a Boolean function of a knowledge base as being the function whose set of true points is the set of models of the knowledge base. In this way the optimal compression of production rule knowledge bases becomes a problem of Boolean function minimization. In this paper we prove that the minimization of Horn functions (i.e. Boolean functions associated to Horn knowledge bases) is..."

Thus, to induce long-term potentiation in the hippocampus, periods of intense synaptic stimulation would have to transiently raise the levels of cytosolic calcium at postsynaptic sites--dendritic spines in the majority of cases. Since direct experimental verification of this hypothesis is not possible at present, calcium levels have been studied by numerically solving the appropriate electro-diffusion equations for two different postsynaptic structures. Under the assumption that voltage-dependent calcium channels are present on dendritic spines, free intracellular calcium in spines can reach micromolar levels after as few as seven spikes in 20 milliseconds. Moreover, a short, but high-frequency, burst of presynaptic activity is more effective in raising levels of calcium and especially of the calcium-calmodulin complex than sustained low-frequency activity. This behavior is different from that seen at the soma of a typical vertebrate neuron."

Intracellular double\u2010ramp current injection at frequencies of 1\u201020 Hz revealed that inferior olivary neurones tend to fire at two preferred frequencies: 3\u20106 Hz when the cells were actively depolarized (resting potential less than \u201050 mV), and 9\u201012 Hz when they were actively hyperpolarized (resting potential more than \u201075 mV). In 10% of the experiments spontaneous subthreshold oscillations of the membrane potential were observed. These oscillations, which resembled sinusoidal wave forms and had a frequency of 4\u20106 Hz and an amplitude of 5\u201010 mV, occurred synchronously in all cells tested within the slice. These oscillations persisted in the presence of 10(\u20104) M\u2010tetrodotoxin and were blocked by Ca2+ conductance blockers or by the removal of Ca2+ from the bathing solution. The oscillations were affected by gross extracellular stimulation of the slice but not by intracellular activation of any given neurone. The data indicate that these oscillations reflect the properties of neuronal ensembles comprised of a large number of coupled elements. Similar ensemble oscillation could be induced, in most experiments, by adding harmaline (0.1 mg/ml) and serotonin (10(\u20104) M) to the bath and could be blocked by bath addition of noradrenaline. Harmaline was found to increase cell excitability by hyperpolarizing the neurones and shifting the inactivation curve for the somatic Ca2+ spike to a more positive membrane potential level. The role inferior olivary oscillations play in the organization of motor coordination is discussed."
