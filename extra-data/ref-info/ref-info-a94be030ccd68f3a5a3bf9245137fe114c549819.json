Run times grow approximately as n2; in absolute terms, a typical 100-city problem requires less than 25 seconds for one case GE635, and about three minutes to obtain the optimum with above 95 per cent confidence."

In this study we tested human performance on a real and virtual floor, as well as in a threedimensional (3D) virtual space. Human performance on the real floor is as good as that on a computer screen. Performance on a virtual floor is very similar, while that in a 3D space is slightly but systematically worse. We modeled these results by a graph pyramid algorithm. The same algorithm can account for the results with 2D and 3D problems, which suggests that deterioration of performance in the 3D space can be attributed to geometrical relations between hierarchical clustering in a 3D space and coarse-to-fine production of a tour."

Most non-trivial problems have complicated fitness functions, and optimization tends to become stuck in local fitness maxima. A recently introduced strategy to escape (simulated annealing) involves accepting unfavourable mutations with finite probability1\u20133. Independently, there has been interest in genetic strategies which overcome the problem of fitness maxima in biological evolution4\u20136, and several authors have applied biological elements to optimization7,8. Here we use computer algorithms to investigate new strategies for the 64-city travelling salesman problem, which combine conventional optimization or \u2018quenching\u2019 with biological elements, namely having a population of trial solutions, helping weaker individuals to survive, and an analogue of sexual crossing-over of genes. The new strategies were faster and gave better results than simulated annealing."

The problem of finding numberings which are optimal in the sense of minimizing the edgesum is NP-complete [2] but has been solved in the special case where the graph is the $2^n $ cube [3] and for several instances of graphs with high degrees of symmetry [6]. We find the solutions for numberings of an $N \\times N$ array. These have practical application in the problem of representing spatial information in a one-dimensional medium. To find our solutions, we exploit the fact that such numberings can always be taken to be ordered, in the sense that numbers increase along rows and down columns. We also consider a generalization of this problem to the case where the differences are raised to a power q. We derive bounds on the edgesum in this case, and show that the optimal numberings for $q < 1$ must be essentially different from those we have found for $q = 1$. While the latter ma..."

                "text": "This paper examines the idea that ordered patterns of nerve connections are set up by means of markers carried by the individual cells. The case of the ordered retinotectal projection in amphibia and fishes is discussed in great detail. It is suggested that retinotectal mappings are the result of two mechanisms acting in concert. One mechanism induces a set of retinal markers into the tectum. By this means, an initially haphazard pattern of synapses is transformed into a continuous or piece-wise continuous projection. The other mechanism places the individual pieces of the map in the correct orientation. The machinery necessary for this inductive scheme has been expressed in terms of a set of differential equations, which have been solved numerically for a number of cases. Straightforward assumptions are made as to how markers are distributed in the retina; how they are induced into the tectum; and how the induced markers bring about alterations in the pattern of synaptic contacts. A detailed physiological interpretation of the model is given. The inductive mechanism has been formulated at the level of the individual synaptic interactions. Therefore, it is possible to specify, in a given situation, not only the nature of the end state of the mapping but also how the mapping develops over time. The role of the modes of growth of retina and tectum in shaping the developing projection becomes clear. Since, on this model, the tectum is initially devoid of markers, there is an important difference between the development and the regeneration of ordered mappings. In the development of duplicate maps from various types of compound-eyes, it is suggested that the tectum, rather than the retina, contains an abnormal distribution of markers. An important parameter in these experiments, and also in the regeneration experiments where part-duplication has been found, is the range of interaction amongst the retinal cells. It is suggested that the results of many of the regeneration experiments (including apparently contradictory ones) are manifestations of a conflict between the two alternative ways of specifying the orientation of the map: through the information carried by the markers previously induced into the tectum and through the orientation mechanism itself."

This cellular approach, along with new anatomical, physiological, and behavioral methods, has enabled the investigation of the machinery whereby the visual stimulus initiates motor movement. It is these advances that we concentrate on in this review. We emphasize the primate superior colliculus because most of the work relating to movement has been done in the rhesus monkey, Macaca mulatta. At the same time we draw on work done on the cat and tree shrew to supplement areas as yet unexplored in the monkey, although many interesting facets of work on these and other species are not considered. Other recent reviews have considered many of these other aspects (Sprague et al 1970, Gordon 1975, Sprague 1972,"

The topographic representation of the visual filed was similar to what has been found in other mammals, with the temporal part of the contralateral visual field projecting posteriorly and the inferior visual field projecting laterally. At the anterior margin of the tectum receptive fields recorded through the contralateral eye and invaded the ipsilateral visual hemifield for up to 35 degrees, suggesting that the entire visual field through one eye is represented on the contralateral superior colliculus. Cells located closest to the tectal surface had relatively small receptive fields, averaging 9 degrees in center diameter; field sizes increased steadily with depth. The prevailing cell type in the stratum zonal and superficial gray responded best to a small dark or light object of any shape moved slowly through the receptive-field center or to turning a small stationary spot on or off. Large objects or diffuse light were usually much less effective. Less than one-quarter of superficial layer cells showed directional selectivity to a moving object, the majority of these favoring up and nasal movement. The chief visual cell type in the stratum opticum and upper part of the intermediate gray resembled in the newness neurons described for many other vertebrates: they had large receptive fields and responded best to up and nasal movement of a small dark or light object, whose optimal size was similar to the optimum for upper-layer cells. If the same part of the receptive field was repeatedly stimulated there was a marked tendency to habituate. Only very few cels responded to the ipsilateral eye. Intermixed with visual cells in the upper part of the intermediate gray were cells that responded to somatosensory or auditory stimuli. Here bimodal and trimodal cells were also seen. In deeper layers somatosensory and auditory modalities tended to take over. These two modalities were not segregated into sublayers but rather seemed to be arranged in clusters. Responses to somatosensory and auditory stimuli were brisk, showing little habituation to repeated stimulation."

Much of our knowledge of the rules of neuronal connectivity derives from the study of the development of the frog visual system, which has the advantages of being simple, and accessible throughout embryonic development. When two separate eyes are made to innervate a single frog optic tectum, the two projections separate into stripes, reminiscent of the ocular dominance stripes of the mammalian visual cortex1. We report here an experiment in which the projection from a single eye, surgically constructed in the embryo out of two matching half-eyes (a \u2018compound\u2019 eye), separates out into stripes. The observation that a single eye can produce a striped projection rules out many hypotheses of how stripes are formed, and provides evidence that the formation of an ordered projection on the optic tectum requires the operation of two separate mechanisms."

A set of chemical markers that express the neighborhood relationships within the presynaptic sheet is induced by the fibers into the postsynaptic sheet. The markers are used to guide the fibers to their terminal sites. A case for which this idea may be relevant is the retinotectal projection; our model exhibits types of plasticity found experimentally. The fact that the postsynaptic markers remain after removal of the projecting fibers suggests an important difference between development and regeneration. This paper concentrates on explaining the basic idea, and in addition presents a set of preliminary computer simulations."

                "text": "Transplantation of a third eye primordium to the forebrain region of a frog (Rana pipiens) embryo causes two retinal projections to converge on a single tectal lobe. These projections form stereotyped eye- specific termination bands (Constantine-Paton, M., and M. I. Law (1978) Science 202: 639\u2013641) that are similar to the source-specific stripes found normally in many regions of the mammalian brain. In the present study, we use quantitative analyses of anatomical data and double labeling techniques to demonstrate that induced bands of three-eyed frogs are approximately 200 micrometers wide, that they invariably run in a rostrolateral to caudomedial direction, and that they represent interdigitating synaptic zones which fill the entire superficial neuropil of the dually innervated tectal lobe. This periodic segregation pattern is not seen in the superinnervated diencephalon or in the optic tracts. Morphometric measurements on animals with dually innervated tectal lobes revealed an approximate 30% hyperplasia that was restricted largely to the deeper predominantly cellular tectal layers. Each of the banded retinal projections occupied neuropil volumes that were roughly 50% smaller than the volume occupied by the noncompeting retina of the same animal. Eye-specific segregation was detected with extracellular recording techniques as an ability of one of the two eyes to elicit consistently more and larger action potentials throughout a radial penetration of the superficial tectal neuropil. In several preparations, electrolytic lesions confirmed that physiologically defined positions of eye dominance corresponded to a band from the same eye. Maps of the visual field projections within dually innervated tecta were relatively normal and their orientation was consistent with the initial embryonic orientation of the retinas. Eye laterality, time of arrival, or fasciculation during growth are not responsible for this induced banding. Instead, our results are attributed to two mechanisms that are probably fundamental to neural mapping. These are: differential affinities between retinal and tecta loci which normally align the projection by bringing together appropriate pre- and postsynaptic areas and interactions among retinal ganglion cell fibers. The latter causes axons from physically neighboring retinal ganglion cell bodies to terminate together within the tectum and consequently increases the internal order of map. We propose that these same two mapping mechanisms may be responsible for the afferent segregation found in diverse regions of many vertebrate brains."
