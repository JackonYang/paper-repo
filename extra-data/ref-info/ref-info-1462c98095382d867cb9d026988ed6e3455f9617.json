Segmented characters from a complex data gathering form are initially classified using an OCR engine based on a combination of Karhunen-Loeve transforms and a back-propagation neural network. Systems of equations are derived from the data gathering form to determine the values of characters rejected by the OCR engine and to verify the consistency of the data captured. If the OCR results for a single form are determined to be inconsistent with respect to the form's data relationships, a set of decision algorithms which incorporates a second neural network and uses additional character features is used to tag characters according to their likelihood of substitution error. Potential substitution errors are incrementally added to the set of OCR reject errors and are processed through dynamically selected systems of equations and search techniques which correct both error classes. We provide experimental results and determine the extent to which errors can be detected and corrected for various OCR error rates."

                "text": "A fast lexicon search based on trie is presented. Traditionally, a successful trie retrieval requires each element of the input string to find an exact match on a particular path in the trie. However, this approach cannot verify a garbled input string, which is generated due to imperfect character segmentation and recognition of an OCR. The string may contain multiple candidates for a character position or no candidate due to segmentation error. The proposed representation scheme, an extension of trie, allows lexicon look-up even with only some of the string elements specified. An input string is presented as a regular expression and all the paths in the trie that satisfy the expression will be considered as word candidates. The candidates can then be ranked based on character classifier decisions. Confusion in character recognition can be handled by allowing an expression component to have more than one character candidate while segmentation error can be overcome by postulating a word region to contain a certain number of unknown characters. Three extensions have been made to trie data structures for position independent access and fast exhaustive search of all valid paths: (1) bidirectional linkage between two nodes at adjacent levels to enable trie traversal in either direction, (2) the nodes with the same letter at the same word position are linked so that all the words which have the same letter at a specific position can be located immediately, and (3) an index table which records the entry points of letters at specific word positions in the trie in order to facilitate trie access at an arbitrary letter position. This representation scheme has been tested on postal address field recognition. The trie represents 11,157 words, the average access time is 0.02 sec on a SUN SPARC2 and with an average of 3 candidates."

This paper points out that the use of angle-radius rather than slope-intercept parameters simplifies the computation further. It also shows how the method can be used for more general curve fitting, and gives alternative interpretations that explain the source of its efficiency."
