                "text": "Many chemoinformatics applications, including high-throughput virtual screening, benefit from being able to rapidly predict the physical, chemical, and biological properties of small molecules to screen large repositories and identify suitable candidates. When training sets are available, machine learning methods provide an effective alternative to ab initio methods for these predictions. Here, we leverage rich molecular representations including 1D SMILES strings, 2D graphs of bonds, and 3D coordinates to derive efficient machine learning kernels to address regression problems. We further expand the library of available spectral kernels for small molecules developed for classification problems to include 2.5D surface and 3D kernels using Delaunay tetrahedrization and other techniques from computational geometry, 3D pharmacophore kernels, and 3.5D or 4D kernels capable of taking into account multiple molecular configurations, such as conformers. The kernels are comprehensively tested using cross-validation and redundancy-reduction methods on regression problems using several available data sets to predict boiling points, melting points, aqueous solubility, octanol/water partition coefficients, and biological activity with state-of-the art results. When sufficient training data are available, 2D spectral kernels in general tend to yield the best and most robust results, better than state-of-the art. On data sets containing thousands of molecules, the kernels achieve a squared correlation coefficient of 0.91 for aqueous solubility prediction and 0.94 for octanol/water partition coefficient prediction. Averaging over conformations improves the performance of kernels based on the three-dimensional structure of molecules, especially on challenging data sets. Kernel predictors for aqueous solubility (kSOL), LogP (kLOGP), and melting point (kMELT) are available over the Web through: http://cdb.ics.uci.edu."

                "text": "Proposing reasonable mechanisms and predicting the course of chemical reactions is important to the practice of organic chemistry. Approaches to reaction prediction have historically used obfuscating representations and manually encoded patterns or rules. Here we present ReactionPredictor, a machine learning approach to reaction prediction that models elementary, mechanistic reactions as interactions between approximate molecular orbitals (MOs). A training data set of productive reactions known to occur at reasonable rates and yields and verified by inclusion in the literature or textbooks is derived from an existing rule-based system and expanded upon with manual curation from graduate level textbooks. Using this training data set of complex polar, hypervalent, radical, and pericyclic reactions, a two-stage machine learning prediction framework is trained and validated. In the first stage, filtering models trained at the level of individual MOs are used to reduce the space of possible reactions to consider. In the second stage, ranking models over the filtered space of possible reactions are used to order the reactions such that the productive reactions are the top ranked. The resulting model, ReactionPredictor, perfectly ranks polar reactions 78.1% of the time and recovers all productive reactions 95.7% of the time when allowing for small numbers of errors. Pericyclic and radical reactions are perfectly ranked 85.8% and 77.0% of the time, respectively, rising to >93% recovery for both reaction types with a small number of allowed errors. Decisions about which of the polar, pericyclic, or radical reaction type ranking models to use can be made with >99% accuracy. Finally, for multistep reaction pathways, we implement the first mechanistic pathway predictor using constrained tree-search to discover a set of reasonable mechanistic steps from given reactants to given products. Webserver implementations of both the single step and pathway versions of ReactionPredictor are available via the chemoinformatics portal http://cdb.ics.uci.edu/."

Recursive CC is a neural network model recently proposed for the processing of structured data. It allows the direct handling of chemical compounds as labeled ordered directed graphs, and constitutes a novel approach to QSAR. The adopted representation of molecular structure captures, in a quite general and flexible way, significant topological aspects and chemical functionalities for each specific class of molecules showing a particular chemical reactivity or biological activity. A class of 1,4-benzodiazepin-2-ones is analyzed by the proposed approach. It compares favorably versus the traditional QSAR treatment based on equations. To show the ability of the model in capturing most of the structural features that account for the biological activity, the internal representations developed by the networks are analyzed by principal component analysis. This analysis shows that the networks are able to discover relevant structural features just on the basis of the association between the molecular morphology and the target property (affinity)."

                "text": "Being able to predict the course of arbitrary chemical reactions is essential to the theory and applications of organic chemistry. Approaches to the reaction prediction problems can be organized around three poles corresponding to: (1) physical laws; (2) rule-based expert systems; and (3) inductive machine learning. Previous approaches at these poles, respectively, are not high throughput, are not generalizable or scalable, and lack sufficient data and structure to be implemented. We propose a new approach to reaction prediction utilizing elements from each pole. Using a physically inspired conceptualization, we describe single mechanistic reactions as interactions between coarse approximations of molecular orbitals (MOs) and use topological and physicochemical attributes as descriptors. Using an existing rule-based system (Reaction Explorer), we derive a restricted chemistry data set consisting of 1630 full multistep reactions with 2358 distinct starting materials and intermediates, associated with 2989 productive mechanistic steps and 6.14 million unproductive mechanistic steps. And from machine learning, we pose identifying productive mechanistic steps as a statistical ranking, information retrieval problem: given a set of reactants and a description of conditions, learn a ranking model over potential filled-to-unfilled MO interactions such that the top-ranked mechanistic steps yield the major products. The machine learning implementation follows a two-stage approach, in which we first train atom level reactivity filters to prune 94.00% of nonproductive reactions with a 0.01% error rate. Then, we train an ensemble of ranking models on pairs of interacting MOs to learn a relative productivity function over mechanistic steps in a given system. Without the use of explicit transformation patterns, the ensemble perfectly ranks the productive mechanism at the top 89.05% of the time, rising to 99.86% of the time when the top four are considered. Furthermore, the system is generalizable, making reasonable predictions over reactants and conditions which the rule-based expert does not handle. A web interface to the machine learning based mechanistic reaction predictor is accessible through our chemoinformatics portal ( http://cdb.ics.uci.edu) under the Toolkits section."

For this purpose, structurally diverse, orally administered model drugs were selected from the World Health Organization (WHO)'s list of essential drugs. The solubility and permeability of the drugs were determined using well-established in vitro methods in highly accurate experimental settings. Descriptors for molecular surface area were generated from low-energy conformations obtained by conformational analysis using molecular mechanics calculations. Correlations between the calculated molecular surface area descriptors, on one hand, and solubility and permeability, on the other, were established with multivariate data analysis (partial least squares projection to latent structures (PLS)) using training and test sets. The obtained models were challenged with external test sets. Both solubility and permeability of the druglike molecules could be predicted with high accuracy from the calculated molecular surface properties alone. The established correlations were used to perform a theoretical biopharmaceutical classification of the WHO-listed drugs into six classes, resulting in a correct prediction for 87% of the essential drugs. An external test set consisting of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standard compounds for biopharmaceutical classification was predicted with 77% accuracy. We conclude that PLS models of easily comprehended molecular surface properties can be used to rapidly provide absorption profiles of druglike molecules early on in drug discovery."

We tested these kernels in conjunction with support vector machines for binary classification on the 60 NCI cancer screening datasets as well as on the NCI HIV data set. Our results show that 3D information leveraged by these kernels can consistently improve prediction accuracy in all datasets.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nAn implementation of the small molecule classifier is available from http://www.dsi.unifi.it/neural/src/3DDK."

The persistence of a chemical within the environment and the effects of a chemical within the body are dependent primarily upon aqueous solubility. With the well-documented limitations hindering the accurate experimental determination of aqueous solubility, the utilization of predictive methods have been widely investigated and employed. The setting of a solubility challenge by this journal proved an excellent opportunity to explore several different modeling methods, utilizing a supplied dataset of high-quality aqueous solubility measurements. Four contrasting approaches (simple linear regression, artificial neural networks, category formation, and available in silico models) were utilized within our laboratory and the quality of these predictions was assessed. These were chosen to span the multitude of modeling methods now in use, while also allowing for the evaluation of existing commercial solubility models. The conclusions of this study were surprising, in that a simple linear regression approach proved to be superior over more complex modeling methods. Possible explanations for this observation are discussed and also recommendations are made for future solubility prediction."

Presently, the best predictors are based on machine learning approaches, in particular neural network architectures with a fixed, and relatively short, input window of amino acids, centered at the prediction site. Although a fixed small window avoids overfitting problems, it does not permit capturing variable long-rang information.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe introduce a family of novel architectures which can learn to make predictions based on variable ranges of dependencies. These architectures extend recurrent neural networks, introducing non-causal bidirectional dynamics to capture both upstream and downstream information. The prediction algorithm is completed by the use of mixtures of estimators that leverage evolutionary information, expressed in terms of multiple alignments, both at the input and output levels. While our system currently achieves an overall performance close to 76% correct prediction--at least comparable to the best existing systems--the main emphasis here is on the development of new algorithmic ideas.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nThe executable program for predicting protein secondary structure is available from the authors free of charge.\n\n\nCONTACT\npfbaldi@ics.uci.edu, gpollast@ics.uci.edu, brunak@cbs.dtu.dk, paolo@dsi.unifi.it."

Here we use these principles to derive several specific classes of DAG-RNN architectures based on lattices, trees, and other structured graphs. These architectures can process a wide range of data structures with variable sizes and dimensions. While the overall resulting models remain probabilistic, the internal deterministic dynamics allows efficient propagation of information, as well as training by gradient descent, in order to tackle large-scale problems. These methods are used here to derive state-of-the-art predictors for protein structural features such as secondary structure (1D) and both fine- and coarse-grained contact maps (2D). Extensions, relationships to graphical models, and implications for the design of neural architectures are briefly discussed.

Because contact maps provide a translation and rotation invariant topological representation of a protein, they can be used as a fundamental intermediary step in protein structure prediction.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe develop a new set of flexible machine learning architectures for the prediction of contact maps, as well as other information processing and pattern recognition tasks. The architectures can be viewed as recurrent neural network implemantations of a class of Bayesian networks we call generalized input-output HMMs (GIOHMMs). For the specific case of contact maps, contextual information is propagated laterally through four hidden planes, one for each cardinal corner. We show that these architectures can be trained from examples and yield contact map predictors that outperform previously reported methods. While several extensions and improvements are in progress, the current version can accurately predict 60.5% of contacts at a distance cutoff of 8 A and 45% of distant contacts at 10 A, for proteins of length up to 300."

                "text": "MOTIVATION\nResidue-residue contact prediction is important for protein structure prediction and other applications. However, the accuracy of current contact predictors often barely exceeds 20% on long-range contacts, falling short of the level required for ab initio structure prediction.\n\n\nRESULTS\nHere, we develop a novel machine learning approach for contact map prediction using three steps of increasing resolution. First, we use 2D recursive neural networks to predict coarse contacts and orientations between secondary structure elements. Second, we use an energy-based method to align secondary structure elements and predict contact probabilities between residues in contacting alpha-helices or strands. Third, we use a deep neural network architecture to organize and progressively refine the prediction of contacts, integrating information over both space and time. We train the architecture on a large set of non-redundant proteins and test it on a large set of non-homologous domains, as well as on the set of protein domains used for contact prediction in the two most recent CASP8 and CASP9 experiments. For long-range contacts, the accuracy of the new CMAPpro predictor is close to 30%, a significant increase over existing approaches.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nCMAPpro is available as part of the SCRATCH suite at http://scratch.proteomics.ics.uci.edu/.\n\n\nCONTACT\npfbaldi@uci.edu\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."

We propose new kernels with a parameter to control the complexity of the subtrees used as features to represent the graphs. This parameter allows to smoothly interpolate between classical graph kernels based on the count of common walks, on the one hand, and kernels that emphasize the detection of large common subtrees, on the other hand. We also propose two modular extensions to this formulation. The first extension increases the number of subtrees that define the feature space, and the second one removes noisy features from the graph representations. We validate experimentally these new kernels on problems of toxicity and anti-cancer activity prediction for small molecules with support vector machines."

However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization often appears to get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently proposed a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning procedure relying on the training algorithm of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) to initialize the parameters of a deep belief network (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. This was followed by the proposal of another greedy layer-wise procedure, relying on the usage of autoassociator networks. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study these algorithms empirically to better understand their success. Our experiments confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy helps the optimization by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, but also implicitly acts as a sort of regularization that brings better generalization and encourages internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input. We also present a series of experiments aimed at evaluating the link between the performance of deep neural networks and practical aspects of their topology, for example, demonstrating cases where the addition of more depth helps. Finally, we empirically explore simple variants of these training algorithms, such as the use of different RBM input unit distributions, a simple way of combining gradient estimators to improve performance, as well as on-line versions of those algorithms."

The accurate prediction of solubility would be very useful. However, systematic errors and lack of metadata associated with measurements greatly reduce the confidence in current models. To address this, we are accurately measuring intrinsic solubility values, and here we report results for a diverse set of 100 druglike molecules at 25 degrees C and an ionic strength of 0.15 M using the CheqSol approach. This is a highly reproducible potentiometric technique that ensures the thermodynamic equilibrium is reached rapidly. Results with a coefficient of variation higher than 4% were rejected. In addition, the Potentiometric Cycling for Polymorph Creation method, [PC] (2), was used to obtain multiple polymorph forms from aqueous solution. We now challenge researchers to predict the intrinsic solubility of 32 other druglike molecules that have been measured but are yet to be published."

The best results obtained on supervised learning tasks involve an unsupervised learning component, usually in an unsupervised pre-training phase. Even though these new algorithms have enabled training deep models, many questions remain as to the nature of this difficult learning problem. The main question investigated here is the following: how does unsupervised pre-training work? Answering this questions is important if learning in deep architectures is to be further improved. We propose several explanatory hypotheses and test them through extensive simulations. We empirically show the influence of pre-training with respect to architecture depth, model capacity, and number of training examples. The experiments confirm and clarify the advantage of unsupervised pre-training. The results suggest that unsupervised pre-training guides the learning towards basins of attraction of minima that support better generalization from the training data set; the evidence from these results supports a regularization explanation for the effect of pre-training."

                "text": "One long-term goal of machine learning research is to produce methods that are applicable to highly complex tasks, such as perception (vision, audition), reasoning, intelligent control, and other artificially intelligent behaviors. We argue that in order to progress toward this goal, the Machine Learning community must endeavor to discover algorithms that can learn highly complex functions, with minimal need for prior knowledge, and with minimal human intervention. We present mathematical and empirical evidence suggesting that many popular approaches to non-parametric learning, particularly kernel methods, are fundamentally limited in their ability to learn complex high-dimensional functions. Our analysis focuses on two problems. First, kernel machines are shallow architectures, in which one large layer of simple template matchers is followed by a single layer of trainable coefficients. We argue that shallow architectures can be very inefficient in terms of required number of computational elements and examples. Second, we analyze a limitation of kernel machines with a local kernel, linked to the curse of dimensionality, that applies to supervised, unsupervised (manifold learning) and semi-supervised kernel machines. Using empirical results on invariant image recognition tasks, kernel methods are compared with deep architectures, in which lower-level features or concepts are progressively combined into more abstract and higher-level representations. We argue that deep architectures have the potential to generalize in non-local ways, i.e., beyond immediate neighbors, and that this is crucial in order to make progress on the kind of complex tasks required for artificial intelligence."

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind."

Scaling such models to full-sized, high-dimensional images remains a difficult problem. To address this problem, we present the convolutional deep belief network, a hierarchical generative model which scales to realistic image sizes. This model is translation-invariant and supports efficient bottom-up and top-down probabilistic inference. Key to our approach is probabilistic max-pooling, a novel technique which shrinks the representations of higher layers in a probabilistically sound way. Our experiments show that the algorithm learns useful high-level visual features, such as object parts, from unlabeled images of objects and natural scenes. We demonstrate excellent performance on several visual recognition tasks and show that our model can perform hierarchical (bottom-up and top-down) inference over full-sized images."

We prove that the linear Boolean autoencoder circuit problem is also NP-hard, and so are several related problems such as: subspace identification over finite fields, linear regression over finite fields, even/odd set intersections, and parity circuits. The emerging picture is that autoencoder optimization is NP-hard in the general case, with a few notable exceptions including the linear cases over infinite fields or the Boolean case with fixed size hidden layer. However learning can be tackled by approximate algorithms, including alternate optimization, suggesting a new class of learning algorithms for deep networks, including deep networks of threshold gates or artificial neurons."

Its determination should therefore take place as early as possible in the process. Because of the large numbers of compounds involved and the very low amounts of each compound available in the early development stage, it is highly desirable to measure the solubility with as little compound as possible and to be able to improve the throughput of the methods used. In this work, a miniaturized shake-flask method was developed and the solubility results were compared with those measured by semiautomated potentiometric acid/base titrations and computational methods for 21 poorly soluble compounds with solubilities mostly in the range 0.03-30 microg/mL. The potentiometric method is very economical (approximately 100 microg of a poorly soluble compound is needed) and is able to create a pH/solubility profile with one single determination, but is limited to ionizable compounds. The miniaturized shake-flask method can be used for all compounds and a wide variety of media. Its precision and throughput proved superior to the potentiometric method for very poorly soluble compounds. Up to 20 compounds a week can be studied with one set-up. Calculated solubility data seem to be sufficient for a first estimate of the solubility, but they cannot currently be used as a substitute for experimental measurements at key decision points in the development process."

We have reexamined available data on this phenomenon and have confirmed that the free energy for saturated hydrocarbons is proportional to the surface area of the cavity created by the solute in the aqueous solution, with the same proportionality constant for linear, branched, and cyclic hydrocarbon molecules. The numerical value of the proportionality constant is uncertain because absolute and self-consistent area measurements are not available. We estimate that it falls between 20 and 25 cal/mole per A(2) at 25 degrees (for areas measured at the distance of closest approach of water molecules), which is significantly less than the figure of 33 cal/mole per A(2) that has been assigned to the same parameter by Hermann [J. Phys. Chem. 76, 2754-2759 (1972)]. A small discrepancy exists when similar data for homologous series of alkyl derivatives are compared with results based on hydrocarbons themselves, and possible reasons for it are discussed."

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

Our method learns vector space representations for multi-word phrases. In sentiment prediction tasks these representations outperform other state-of-the-art approaches on commonly used datasets, such as movie reviews, without using any pre-defined sentiment lexica or polarity shifting rules. We also evaluate the model's ability to predict sentiment distributions on a new dataset based on confessions from the experience project. The dataset consists of personal user stories annotated with multiple labels which, when aggregated, form a multinomial distribution that captures emotional reactions. Our algorithm can more accurately predict distributions over such labels compared to several competitive baselines."

However, practical difficulties have been reported in training recurrent neural networks to perform tasks in which the temporal contingencies present in the input/output sequences span long intervals. We show why gradient based learning algorithms face an increasingly difficult problem as the duration of the dependencies to be captured increases. These results expose a trade-off between efficient learning by gradient descent and latching on information for long periods. Based on an understanding of this problem, alternatives to standard gradient descent are considered."

As a result of the weight adjustments, internal \u2018hidden\u2019 units which are not part of the input or output come to represent important features of the task domain, and the regularities in the task are captured by the interactions of these units.

                "text": "The enumeration of rings in a given structure is essential for any chemical computer system. A number of algorithms for ring perception have been reported and implemented in different computer programs. Indeed ring perception is required for identifying rings as screening substructures in database retrieval, for generating subgoals in computerassisted synthesis, or for providing structural fragments associated with characteristic spectral features. A comparative review was published by Lynch et al.,l who classify these algorithms in four categories: the perception of all cycles, the perception for a set of simple cycles, the perception of a fundamental basis set of rings, and the perception of the smallest set of smallest rings (SSSR) (reference to Figure 2). During the current development of spectral simulation programs within the framework of the DARC system, we devised the module FINDCYC, a new algorithm for ring perception. This routine has the goal of detection and search for the smallest set of smallest rings (SSSR) in a target molecule. But it can also be used to find all cycles with a simple modification. Several techniques have been used for finding the SSSR. Corey and Petersson2 have developed an algorithm for use in the LHASA system. Their algorithm initially finds the set of fundamental basis rings, from which an attempt is made to derive the corresponding reduced basis, a minimum spanning set, the SSSR. Wipke and Dyott3 combined the Welch algorithm4 and Gibbs algorithmS to find all cycles and then derived a minimum covering set, identical to a SSSR. The common point of these algorithms, including also that proposed by Gasteiger and Jochum? is the derivation of the SSSR from all cycles or other sets of basis rings. Plotkin7 has developed one of the first algorithms for directly finding the SSSR. Other algorithms have been proposed by Bersohn? Esack? Zamora,lo and Baumer et al.I1 for the same purpose. All reported algorithms are based on two main methods, a walk through the connection table,8-10J2J3 or graph man i p u l a t i o n ~ . 4 . ~ ~ ~ ~ , ~ ~ , ~ ~ Some theoretical aspects have been summarized by Lynch et a1.l Our algorithm relies on the first approach, and requires as input data only a connection table, which is obtained from a routine for graphical acquisition of the target molecule. An example of the connection table is given in Table I for the molecule shown in Figure 1. The SSSR found in a target molecule may be used to generate other types of ring sets, such as the extended set of"

                "text": "Most tasks require a person or an automated system to reason -- to reach conclusions based on available information. The framework of probabilistic graphical models, presented in this book, provides a general approach for this task. The approach is model-based, allowing interpretable models to be constructed and then manipulated by reasoning algorithms. These models can also be learned automatically from data, allowing the approach to be used in cases where manually constructing a model is difficult or even impossible. Because uncertainty is an inescapable aspect of most real-world applications, the book focuses on probabilistic models, which make the uncertainty explicit and provide models that are more faithful to reality. Probabilistic Graphical Models discusses a variety of models, spanning Bayesian networks, undirected Markov networks, discrete and continuous models, and extensions to deal with dynamical systems and relational data. For each class of models, the text describes the three fundamental cornerstones: representation, inference, and learning, presenting both basic concepts and advanced techniques. Finally, the book considers the use of the proposed framework for causal reasoning and decision making under uncertainty. The main text in each chapter provides the detailed technical development of the key ideas. Most chapters also include boxes with additional material: skill boxes, which describe techniques; case study boxes, which discuss empirical cases related to the approach described in the text, including applications in computer vision, robotics, natural language understanding, and computational biology; and concept boxes, which present significant concepts drawn from the material in the chapter. Instructors (and readers) can group chapters in various combinations, from core topics to more technically advanced material, to suit their particular needs."

Minimal preprocessing of the data is required, but the architecture of the network is highly constrained and specifically designed for the task. The input of the network consists of size-normalized images of isolated digits. The performance on zip code digits provided by the US Postal Service is 92% recognition, 1% substitution, and 7% rejects. Structured neural networks can be viewed as statistical methods with structure which bridge the gap between purely statistical and purely structural methods.<<ETX>>"

The algorithm converges quickly because the lengths of the paths that need to be scanned to discover each new ring decrease when a smaller ring is found."

Models are based on about 4000 compounds, including an in-house set of 632 drug discovery molecules of Bayer Schering Pharma. For each method, we also consider an appropriate method to obtain error bars, in order to estimate the domain of applicability (DOA) for each model. Here, we investigate error bars from a Bayesian model (Gaussian Process (GP)), an ensemble based approach (Random Forest), and approaches based on the Mahalanobis distance to training data (for Support Vector Machine and Ridge Regression models). We evaluate all approaches in terms of their prediction accuracy (in cross-validation, and on an external validation set of 536 molecules) and in how far the individual error bars can faithfully represent the actual prediction error."
