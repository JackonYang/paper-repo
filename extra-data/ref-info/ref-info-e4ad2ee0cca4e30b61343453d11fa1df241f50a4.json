Image manipulation procedures for a fast handwritten word recognizer, including pre-processing, segmentation, and feature extraction, have been implemented using the chain code representation and presented in this paper. Pre-processing includes noise removal, slant correction and smoothing of contours. Slant angle is estimated by averaging orientation angles of vertical strokes. Smoothing removes jaggedness on contours. Segmentation points are determined using ligatures and concavity features. Average stroke width of an image is used in an adaptive fashion to locate ligatures. Concavities are located by examination of slope changes in contours. Feature extraction efficiently converts a segment into feature vectors. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithms developed. Three-thousand word images captured from real mail pieces, with size of 217 by 82 in average, are used in the experiments. Average processing times taken for each module are 10, 15, and 34 msec on a single Sparc 10 for pre-processing, segmentation, and feature extraction, respectively."

                "text": "This article describes the proposed implementation of a new model for the linguistic postprocessing component of the Human Language Technology (HLT) project. The model was designed for handwriting recognition applications but can be used for other text recognition problems and speech recognition. We demonstrate here that the current implementation (the POS model) fails to incorporate new sources of information such as word n\u2010grams, and further handles the recognizer's scores incorrectly. We propose an alternative approach (the SSS model) which remedies these shortcomings. We also show that the SSS algorithm has a direct interpretation as a Hidden Markov Model whose states correspond to words that have been tagged with their parts of speech, and whose observations are discretized recognizer confidences. The HMM interpretation has the added advantage that the approach can be naturally extended to handle error recovery of the recognizer. Preliminary results indicate that the SSS model is successful in selecting the truth path over alternate paths. \u00a9 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc."

The usefulness of 'regular' versus 'singular' classes of features is stressed. These notions are applied to obtain a graph, G, representing a line image, and also to find an 'axis' as the regular part of G. The complements to G of the axis are the 'tarsi', singular parts of G, which correspond to informative features of a cursive word. A segmentation of the graph is obtained, giving a symbolic description chain (SDC). Using one or more as robust anchors, possible words in a list of words are selected. Candidate words are examined to see if the other letters fit the rest of the SDC. Good results are obtained for clean images of words written by several persons. >"

Preprocessing, segmentation and feature extraction are implemented using a chain code representation of the word contour. Dynamic matching between characters of a lexicon entry and segment(s) of the input word image is used to rank the lexicon entries in order of best match. Variable duration for each character is defined and used during the matching. Experimental results prove that our approach using the variable duration outperforms the method using fixed duration in terms of both accuracy and speed. Speed of the entire recognition process is about 200 msec on a single SPARC-10 platform and the recognition accuracy is 96.8 percent are achieved for lexicon size of 10, on a database of postal words captured at 212 dpi."

Several component processes of a recognition system for isolated offline cursive script words are described. A word image is transformed through a hierarchy of representation levels: points, contours, features, letters, and words. A unique feature representation is generated bottom-up from the image using statistical dependences between letters and features. Ratings for partially formed words are computed using a stack algorithm and a lexicon represented as a trie. Several novel techniques for low- and intermediate-level processing for cursive script are described, including heuristics for reference line finding, letter segmentation based on detecting local minima along the lower contour and areas with low vertical profiles, simultaneous encoding of contours and their topological relationships, extracting features, and finding shape-oriented events. Experiments demonstrating the performance of the system are also described. >"

The GSC algorithm takes a quasi multi-dio approach to feature generation. This philosophy coupled with the appropriaie *tf,aatim function results in a recognizer which has both high accuracy and good-'et-cc behavior. This allows it to be used in higher level digit string and word ggliti@ algorithms which search for digit/character boundaries. Tests of the GSC Ner oD standard digit, character and non-character databases are reported. L htroduction lfuy different approaches have been used by researchers to solve the problem of machine qn end character recognition [Suen92]. These approaches have included investigations of: t&re seb [Srik93] Man86], classifier algorithms, multiple combinations of classifrers tltogSl and novel statistical methods [Klein93]. There can be much overlap between Cftreot methods and a precise taxonomy can prove difficutt. It would be safe to say that thc pecise classification of an algorithm has much to do with the perspective of the Lrwstigator during the design of the algorithm. lvtany different algorithms have been explored by the researchers at CEDAR tlee93l. These algorithms have encompassed a wide range of feature and classifier t1pes. Brcry algorithm has characteristics, such as high speed, high accuracy, good thresholding rbility, and generalization, which are useful for specific applications. Examplas of classifiers &veloped at CEDAR are listed in Table 1. This paper will outline the philosophical and Fcticsl deta'ls of one these classifiers: the Gradient, structural, concavity (GSC) cl'sifier. 2\" Philosophy Tbe approach used in designing the GSC was based on the observation that feature sets can be designed to extact certain tlpes of information from the image. Feature detectors can be built to detect the local, intermediate and global feaares of an image. The basic unit of an image is the pixel and we are interested in both is location (x,y coordinate) and the relationship of the pixel to its neighbors at different ranges from locally and globally.

The subjective aspects of a line drawing are examined. Different encoding schemes are compared, with emphasis on the so-called chain code which is convenient for highly irregular line drawings. The properties of chain-coded line drawings are derived, and algorithms are developed for analyzing line drawings to determine various geometric features. Procedures are described for rotating, expanding, and smoothing line structures, and for establishing the degree of similarity between two contours by a correlation technique. Three applications are described in detail: automatic assembly of jigsaw puzzles, map matching, and optimum two-dimensional template layout"
