The Linked Data principles provide a basis for realizing this Web of Data, or Semantic Web. Since early 2007 numerous data sets have been published on the Web according to these principles, in domains as broad as music, books, geographical information, films, people, events, reviews and photos. In combination these data sets consist of over 2 billion RDF triples, interlinked by more than 3 million triples that cross data sets. As this Web of Linked Data continues to grow, and an increasing number of applications are developed that exploit these data sets, there is a growing need for data publishers, researchers, developers and Web practitioners to understand Linked Data principles and practice. Run by some of the leading members of the Linked Data community, this tutorial will address those needs, and provide participants with a solid foundation from which to begin publishing Linked Data on the Web, as well as to implement applications that consume Linked Data from the Web."

Growing beyond the borders of any traditional encyclopaedia, it is facing new problems of knowledge management: The current excessive usage of article lists and categories witnesses the fact that 19th century content organization technologies like inter-article references and indices are no longer sufficient for today\u2019s needs. Rather, it is necessary to allow knowledge processing in a computer assisted way, for example to intelligently query the knowledge base. To this end, we propose the introduction of typed links as an extremely simple and unintrusive way for rendering large parts of Wikipedia machine readable. We provide a detailed plan on how to achieve this goal in a way that hardly impacts usability and performance, propose an implementation plan, and discuss possible difficulties on Wikipedia\u2019s way to the semantic future of the World Wide Web. The possible gains of this endeavor are huge; we sketch them by considering some immediate applications that semantic technologies can provide to enhance browsing, searching, and editing Wikipedia."

Structural knowledge, e. g. about how concepts are interrelated, can neither be formally stated nor automatically processed. Also the wealth of numerical data is only available as plain text and thus can not be processed by its actual meaning.We provide an extension to be integrated in Wikipedia, that allows even casual users the typing of links between articles and the specification of typed data inside the articles. Wiki users profit from more specific ways of searching and browsing. Each page has an RDF export, that gives direct access to the formalised knowledge. This allows applications to use Wikipedia as a background knowledge base."

The Tabulator is an RDF browser, which is designed both for new users to provoke interest in the Semantic Web and give them a means to access and interact with the entire web of RDF data, and for developers of RDF content to provide incentive for them to post their data in RDF, to refine and promote RDF linking standards, and to let providers see how their data interacts with the rest of the Semantic Web. A challenge for Semantic Web browsers is to bring the power of domain-specific applications to a generic program when new unexpected domains can be encountered in real time. The Tabulator project is an attempt to demonstrate and utilize the power of linked RDF data with a user-friendly Semantic Web browser that is able to recognize and follow RDF links to other RDF resources based on the user\u2019s exploration and analysis."

Structural knowledge, e.,g. about how concepts are interrelated, can neither be formally stated nor automatically processed. Also the wealth of numerical data is only available as plain text and thus can not be processed by its actual meaning.We provide an extension to be integrated in Wikipedia, that allows the typing of links between articles and the specification of typed data inside the articles in an easy-to-use manner.Enabling even casual users to participate in the creation of an open semantic knowledge base, Wikipedia has the chance to become a resource of semantic statements, hitherto unknown regarding size, scope, openness, and internationalisation. These semantic enhancements bring to Wikipedia benefits of today's semantic technologies: more specific ways of searching and browsing. Also, the RDF export, that gives direct access to the formalised knowledge, opens Wikipedia up to a wide range of external applications, that will be able to use it as a background knowledge base.In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and possible uses of this extension."

The Wikipedia project, for example, succeeded in creating the by far largest encyclopedia just on the basis of a wiki. Recently, several approaches have been proposed on how to extend wikis to allow the creation of structured and semantically enriched content. However, the means for creating semantically enriched structured content are already available and are, although unconsciously, even used by Wikipedia authors. In this article, we present a method for revealing this structured content by extracting information from template instances. We suggest ways to efficiently query the vast amount of extracted information (e.g. more than 8 million RDF statements for the English Wikipedia version alone), leading to astonishing query answering possibilities (such as for the title question). We analyze the quality of the extracted content, and propose strategies for quality improvements with just minor modifications of the wiki systems being currently used."

We discuss adapting a relational engine for native RDF support with dedicated data types, bitmap indexing and SQL optimizer techniques. We discuss adaptations of the query engine for running on shared nothing clusters, providing virtually unbounded scalability for RDF or relational warehouses. We further discuss mapping existing relational data into RDF for SPARQL access without converting the data into physical triples. We present conclusions and metrics as well as a number of use cases, from DBpedia to bio informatics and collaborative web applications."

In this paper we describe an approach to computing provenance when the data of interest has been created by a database query. We adopt a syntactic approach and present results for a general data model that applies to relational databases as well as to hierarchical data such as XML. A novel aspect of our work is a distinction between \"why\" provenance (refers to the source data that had some influence on the existence of the data) and \"where\" provenance (refers to the location(s) in the source databases from which the data was extracted)."

YAGO builds on entities and relations and currently contains more than 1 million entities and 5 million facts. This includes the Is-A hierarchy as well as non-taxonomic relations between entities (such as HASONEPRIZE). The facts have been automatically extracted from Wikipedia and unified with WordNet, using a carefully designed combination of rule-based and heuristic methods described in this paper. The resulting knowledge base is a major step beyond WordNet: in quality by adding knowledge about individuals like persons, organizations, products, etc. with their semantic relationships - and in quantity by increasing the number of facts by more than an order of magnitude. Our empirical evaluation of fact correctness shows an accuracy of about 95%. YAGO is based on a logically clean model, which is decidable, extensible, and compatible with RDFS. Finally, we show how YAGO can be further extended by state-of-the-art information extraction techniques."

We assume that large amounts of data exist that have been organized and annotated according to local schemas. Seeing semantics as a form of agreement, our approach enables the participating data sources to incrementally develop global agreement in an evolutionary and completely decentralized process that solely relies on pair-wise, local interactions: Participants provide translations between schemas they are interested in and can learn about other translations by routing queries (gossiping). To support the participants in assessing the semantic quality of the achieved agreements we develop a formal framework that takes into account both syntactic and semantic criteria. The assessment process is incremental and the quality ratings are adjusted along with the operation of the system. Ultimately, this process results in global agreement, i.e., the semantics that all participants understand. We discuss strategies to efficiently find translations and provide results from a case study to justify our claims. Our approach applies to any system which provides a communication infrastructure (existing websites or databases, decentralized systems, P2P systems) and offers the opportunity to study semantic interoperability as a global phenomenon in a network of information sharing parties."

The reason is that database systems focus on structured data, leaving the unstructured realm to others. The world of unstructured data has several very appealing properties, such as ease of authoring, querying and data sharing. In contrast, authoring, querying and sharing structured data require significant effort, albeit with the benefit of rich query languages and exact answers. We argue that in order to broaden the use of data management tools, we need a concerted effort to cross this structure chasm, by importing the attractive properties of the unstructured world into the structured one. As an initial effort in this direction, we introduce the REVERE System, which offers several mechanisms for crossing the structure chasm, and considers as its first application the chasm on the WWW. REVERE includes three innovations: (1) a data creation environment that entices people to structure data and enables them to do it rapidly; (2) a data sharing environment, based on a peer data management system, in which a web of data is created by establishing local mappings between schemas, and query answering is done over the transitive closure of these mappings; (3) a novel set of tools that are based on computing statistics over corpora of schemata and structured data. In a sense, we are trying to adapt the key techniques of the unstructured world, namely computing statistics over text coropra, into the world of structured data. We sketch how statistics computed over such corpora, which capture common term usage patterns, can be used to create tools for assisting in schema and mapping development. The initial application of REVERE focuses on creating a web of structured data from data that is usually stored in HTML web pages (e.g., personal information, course information,"

The quality of provided information varies as information providers have different levels of knowledge and different intentions. Users of web-based systems are therefore confronted with the increasingly difficult task to select high quality information from the vast amount of Web-accessible information. How can information systems support users to distinguish high quality from low quality information? Which filtering mechanisms can be applied? How can filtering decisions be explained to the user? The book gives an overview about information quality assessment in context of web-based systems. Afterwards, a quality-driven information filtering framework is developed. The framework allows information consumers to apply a wide range of different filtering policies. In order to facilitate the information consumers' understanding of filtering decisions, the framework generates explanations why information satisfies a specific policy. The book targets Web developers who need to handle information quality problems within their applications as well as researchers working on the topic."

This works well if the problem domain is well-understood and relatively static, as with enterprise data. However, it is fundamentally mismatched with the \u201cbottom-up\u201dmodel of scientific data sharing, in which new data needs to be rapidly developed, published, and then assessed, filtered, and revised by others. We address the need for bottom-up collaborative data sharing, in which independent researchers or groups with different goals, schemas, and data can share information in the absence of global agreement. Each group independently curates, revises, and extends its data; eventually the groups compare and reconcile their changes, but they are not required to agree. This paper describes our initial design and prototype of the ORCHESTRA system, which focuses on managing disagreement among multiple data representations and instances. Our work represents an important evolution of the concepts of peer-to-peer data sharing [23], which considers revision, disagreement, authority, and intermittent participation."

Uncertain data and data lineage are two important areas of data management that have been considered extensively in isolation, however many applications require the features in tandem. Fundamentally, lineage enables simple and consistent representation of uncertain data, it correlates uncertainty in query results with uncertainty in the input data, and query processing with lineage and uncertainty together presents computational benefits over treating them separately.We show that the ULDB representation is complete, and that it permits straightforward implementation of many relational operations. We define two notions of ULDB minimality--data-minimal and lineage-minimal--and study minimization of ULDB representations under both notions. With lineage, derived relations are no longer self-contained: their uncertainty depends on uncertainty in the base data. We provide an algorithm for the new operation of extracting a database subset in the presence of interconnected uncertainty. Finally, we show how ULDBs enable a new approach to query processing in probabilistic databases.ULDBs form the basis of the Trio system under development at Stanford."

The layers can be characterized from the top down as information-consuming applications, mediators which perform intelligent integration of information (I3), and data, knowledge and simulation resources.\nThe objective of modules in the I3 architecture is to provide end users' apoplications with information obtained through selection, abstraction, fusion, caching, extrapolation, and pruning of data. The data is obtained from many diverse and heterogeneous sources. The I3 objective requires the establishment of a consensual information system architecture, so that many participants and technologies can contribute. An attempt to provide such a range of services within a single, tightly integrated system is unlikely to survive technological or environmental change.\nThis paper focuses on the computational models needed to support the mediating functions in this architecture and introduces initial applicatiions. The architecture has been motivated in [Wied:92C]."

Autonomy for updating is retained with the local databases. The architecture of Multibase does not require any changes to local databases or DBMSs. There are three principal research goals of the project. The first goal is to develop appropriate language constructs for accessing and integrating heterogeneous databases. The second goal is to discover effective global and local optimization techniques. The final goal is to design methods for handling incompatible data representations and inconsistent data. Currently the project is in the first year of a planned three year effort.

Such systems often rely on the use of mapping tables listing pairs of corresponding values to search for data residing in different peers. In this paper, we address semantic and algorithmic issues related to the use of mapping tables. We begin by arguing why mapping tables are appropriate for data mapping in a peer-to-peer environment. We discuss alternative semantics for these tables and we present a language that allows the user to specify mapping tables under different semantics. Then, we show that by treating mapping tables as constraints (called mapping constraints) on the exchange of information between peers it is possible to reason about them. We motivate why reasoning capabilities are needed to manage mapping tables and show the importance of inferring new mapping tables from existing ones. We study the complexity of this problem and we propose an efficient algorithm for its solution. Finally, we present an implementation along with experimental results that show that mapping tables may be managed efficiently in practice."
