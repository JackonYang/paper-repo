We describe a new method of computing the minimum-perimeter polygon (MPP) of any digitized silhouette satisfying certain constraints of connectedness and smoothness, and establish the underlying theory. Such a digitized silhouette is called a ``regular complex,'' in accordance with the usage in piecewise linear topology. The method makes use of the concept of a stretched string constrained to lie in the cellular boundary of the digitized silhouette. We show that, by properly marking the virtual as well as the real vertices of an MPP, the MPP can serve as a precise representation of any regular complex, and that this representation is often an economical one."

It is shown that one can determine through the use of relatively simple numerical techniques whether a given arbitrary plane curve is open or closed, whether it is singly or multiply connected, and what area it encloses. Further, one can cause a given figure to be expanded, contracted, elongated, or rotated by an arbitrary amount. It is shown that there are a number of ways of encoding arbitrary geometric curves to facilitate such manipulations, each having its own particular advantages and disadvantages. One method, the so-called rectangular-array type of encoding, is discussed in detail. In this method the slope function is quantized into a set of eight standard slopes. This particular representation is one of the simplest and one that is most readily utilized with present-day computing and display equipment."

With this scheme, different quantized versions of the same drawing can be obtained by changing the values of the parameters. Three figures of noise are proposed for evaluating the quality of quantized drawings and design formulae are developed for the parameters of the quantization scheme as functions of bounds on the figures of noise. The degradation of the quality of a quantized drawing resulting from a coordinate transformation and requantization is studied in terms of transformed figures of noise. Also, it is shown theoretically and by means of a number of examples how to choose the parameters of the quantization scheme in order to meet the requirements on the transformed figures of noise. This enables one to quantize a preprocessed satellite picture so that after computation of a Mercator projection, the resulting geographic map will have the required quality. The theory presented in this report is applicable to any irregular line drawing and to any transformation defined by a pair of functions that are continuous together with their partial derivatives."

Bellman confined himself primarily to the analytical derivation, suggesting briefly, however, how the solution of the equation derived for each particular point of subdivision <italic>u<subscrpt>i</subscrpt></italic> could be reduced to a discrete search. In this paper, the computational procedure is considered more fully, and the similarities to some of Stone's equations are indicated. It is further shown that an equation for <italic>u<subscrpt>2</subscrpt></italic> involving no minimization may be found. In addition, it is shown how Bellman's method may be applied to the curve-fitting problem when the additional constraints are added that the ends of the line segments must be on the curve."

Unlike the red blood cell, the white blood cell has a nucleus. The nucleus may be round in shape that is, can have a circular boundary as seen through the microscope - or it can be kidney-shaped, or it can have two, three, or more lobes, see Figure 1 a. The general theory is that a white blood cell starts out with a circular nucleus, which as the cell matures becomes kidney-shaped, and finally lobular, or Polymorphonuclear. Thus our problem becomes one of distinguishing among these shapes of nuclear boundaries."
