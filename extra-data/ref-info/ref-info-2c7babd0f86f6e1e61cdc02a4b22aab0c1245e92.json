Therefore, implicit in the perceptual analysis of occluding contour must lie various assumptions about the viewed surfaces. The assumptions that seem most natural are (a) that the distinction between convex and concave segments reflects real properties of the viewed surface; and (b) that contiguous portions of contour arise from contiguous parts of the viewed surface \u2013 i. e. there are no invisible obscuring edges. It is proved that, for smooth surfaces, these assumptions are essentially equivalent to assuming that the viewed surface is a generalized cone. Methods are defined for finding the axis of such a cone, and for segmenting a surface constructed of several cones into its components, whose axes can then be found separately. These methods provide one link between an uninterpreted figure extracted from an image, and the 3-D representation theory of Marr & Nishihara (1977)."

The present experiments measured discriminability of these simple parts when presented either in isolation or within configural contexts that provided no formal information useful for the discrimination. Certain contexts either impaired or did not affect performance. Other contexts were found, however, which dramatically improved discriminability. Thus, two patterns which differed only in a single part could be discriminated from each other more quickly than could their distinguishing parts shown in isolation. Further experiments suggest that this \"configural superiority\" effect influences perceptual components of processing rather than memorial components. The mechanism underlying configural superiority appears to be the detection of novel and distinguishing features, such as corners and intersections, which emerge when parts are placed in close proximity to each other. The outlines of a model for preattentive feature discrimination are presented."

The results demonstrate that the perception of growth may be based on a specific set of invariant geometric relations described previously by Mark, Todd, and Shaw (1981). When observers are asked to judge which of two facial profiles looks older, they are surprisingly accurate if the profiles are related by an appropriate transformation, but their performance is no better than chance if the profiles are related by an inappropriate transformation. If, on the other hand, they are instructed to judge whether a pair of profiles is the same or different, the differences produced by the appropriate and inappropriate transformations are equally discriminable."

Treisman and Gelade proposed a feature-integration theory of attention, which claims that in the absence of prior knowledge, the separable features of objects are correctly combined only when focused attention is directed to each item in turn. If items are preattentively grouped, however, attention may be directed to groups rather than to single items whenever no recombination of features within a group could generate an illusory target. This prediction is confirmed: In search for conjunctions, subjects appear to scan serially between groups rather than items. The scanning rate shows little effect of the spatial density of distractors, suggesting that it reflects serial fixations of attention rather than eye movements. Search for features, on the other hand, appears to independent of perceptual grouping, suggesting that features are detected preattentively. A conjunction target can be camouflaged at the preattentive level by placing it at the boundary between two adjacent groups, each of which shares one of its features. This suggests that preattentive grouping creates separate feature maps within each separable dimension rather than one global configuration."

                "text": "In attempting to judge whether a briefly presented rotated figure was symmetrical (circle or square) or asymmetrical (ellipse or rectangle), a bias towards perceiving symmetry was evident. This bias appears to be perceptual rather than judgmental in origin in that it was affected neither by variations in the probability of occurrence of symmetrical figures nor by familiarization with the stimuli. A characterization of the stimulus similarity space based on the shape-slant invariance hypothesis is presented, and a model which incorporates both the similarity space and the symmetry bias is proposed. The model can account for our paradoxical finding that the more asymmetrical some projected images, the more likely they will be perceived as symmetrical. This model can also account for Massaro\u2019s (1973, 1975) results on shape constancy. However, Massaro\u2019s theory was not supported in that extension in depth did not account for increased difficulty of shape judgments."

For example, animals can be taught to choose the smaller, or larger, of two stimuli. It is likely that the standard sizes of objects are represented conceptually for the purpose of object recognition. Presented with a box the size of my desk, I am not likely to entertain the hypothesis that it is a box of Kleenex. Underlying the feature system characterizing the dimensions are many aspects of man's representation of space; concepts like vertical and horizontal, cross-section, and spatial extent itself are reflected in many nonlinguistic sensorimotor routines (see Miller and JohnsonLaird 1976; H. H. Clark 1973). As the child learns a new spatial adjective, what aspects of its conceptual underpinnings are mapped onto it early and what aspects, if any, take years to work out? Two positions within the framework of the missing-feature theory have been held. The first position is that the child's initial mapping is between the word and the features specifying the relevant dimension of comparison. The missing feature is polarity, the direction from zero. On this view, both narrow and wide would have the incomplete lexical entry: [Adj] [comparative] [spatial extent] [-primary] [ vertical], making the two words synonyms (Donaldson and Wales 1970; H. H. Clark 1 970; E. V. Clark 1973; Klatzky et al. 1973). The two words need not have identical incomplete lexical entries simultaneously. For example, [+pole] might be added to the representation of wide before [ pole] is to narrow. In this case narrow means what wide did before"

A new set-theoretical approach to similarity is developed in which objects are represented as collections of features, and similarity is described as a feature-matching process. Specifically, a set of qualitative assumptions is shown to imply the contrast model, which expresses the similarity between objects as a linear combination of the measures of their common and distinctive features. Several predictions of the contrast model are tested in studies of similarity with both semantic and perceptual stimuli. The model is used to uncover, analyze, and explain a variety of empirical phenomena such as the role of common and distinctive features, the relations between judgments of similarity and difference, the presence of asymmetric similarities, and the effects of context on judgments of similarity. The contrast model generalizes standard representations of similarity data in terms of clusters and trees. It is also used to analyze the relations of prototypicality and family resemblance"

Robert Louis Stevenson, in an essay on Talk and Talkers, uses the phrase \" flies of obvious error in the amber of truth \", and such a phrase would seem to sum up this book, since it is bound in amber paper and contains a series of twenty experiments designed to show that things are not always what they seem. Some of these experiments are complex and difficult to describe without the accompanying figures; a simple one, however, is the radial motion demonstration. In this, an illuminated white square whose size can be varied is mounted on a black background, and observed monocularly as it is moved forwards and backwards through a distance of 6 ft. in a darkened room. Different effects can be produced according to the relationship between the movement and the size of the square and it is possible-among other effects -to produce the illusion that the square is motionless when it is actually coming towards the observer. Each demonstration is fully described and is accompanied by scale drawings to show how the apparatus for producing it is made. After reading the descriptions, one is left with the hope that some enterprising physiologist with a taste for carpentry will be tempted into making at any rate some of the models, because they show in convincing fashion the bases of visual judgment. One of these models, the \" leaf room \", which was demonstrated at the 1950 International Congress, showed the distortion produced by aniseikonic lenses."

Deregowski suggested earlier that this perceptual strategy might not appear as strongly in less \u2018carpentered\u2019 cultures, among perceivers less familiar with Western modes of depiction. A study is reported in which the performance on the discrimination by US children in grades 1, 4, and 7; and children from Zimbabwe, Africa, in grades 1, 2, 4, and 7\u2014children of less experience with pictures and urban environments\u2014has been examined. All groups evinced the discrimination at high levels of statistical significance. However, the findings disclosed much less accurate performance in the Zimbabwe groups at all grade levels, and no improvement with age either in the US or in Zimbabwe. The absence of improvement argues against an explanation of the difference between the US and Zimbabwe groups in terms of either a carpentered-world hypothesis or a difficulty with picture perception, at least when those interpretations are taken in their simplest forms."

Impossible objects are usually defined from a psychological point of view as mental images of \u2018solid objects\u2019 which cannot exist in a real three-dimensional world. From the mathematical point of view, however, various kinds of impossibility can be observed in such objects, and they are classified according to the kinds of impossibility they possess. Since impossible objects are treated in a purely mathematical way, the results afford a powerful basis for the psychological study of human visual perception of impossible objects. Several psychological problems arising from the present results are also discussed."

In all cases the curvatures of the arcs were underestimated, and the error was a decreasing exponential function of arc length. The results are consistent with the notion that tendency (efferent readiness) to perform rectilinear eye movements produces underestimation of curvature. The results discredited the explanation of the \u201cGibson normalization effect\u201d as an instance of increase in perceptual accuracy. The overestimation of curvature found in earlier studies was interpreted as resulting from an inappropriate perceptual task and uncontrolled effects of illusions of extent."

                "text": "First, the span of absolute judgment and the span of immediate memory impose severe limitations on the amount of information that we are able to receive, process, and remember. By organizing the stimulus input simultaneously into several dimensions and successively into a sequence or chunks, we manage to break (or at least stretch) this informational bottleneck. Second, the process of recoding is a very important one in human psychology and deserves much more explicit attention than it has received. In particular, the kind of linguistic recoding that people do seems to me to be the very lifeblood of the thought processes. Recoding procedures are a constant concern to clinicians, social psychologists, linguists, and anthropologists and yet, probably because recoding is less accessible to experimental manipulation than nonsense syllables or T mazes, the traditional experimental psychologist has contributed little or nothing to their analysis. Nevertheless, experimental techniques can be used, methods of recoding can be specified, behavioral indicants can be found. And I anticipate that we will find a very orderly set of relations describing what now seems an uncharted wilderness of individual differences. Third, the concepts and measures provided by the theory of information provide a quantitative way of getting at some of these questions. The theory provides us with a yardstick for calibrating our stimulus materials and for measuring the performance of our subjects. In the interests of communication I have suppressed the technical details of information measurement and have tried to express the ideas in more familiar terms; I hope this paraphrase will not lead you to think they are not useful in research. Informational concepts have already proved valuable in the study of discrimination and of language; they promise a great deal in the study of learning and memory; and it has even been proposed that they can be useful in the study of concept formation. A lot of questions that seemed fruitless twenty or thirty years ago may now be worth another look. In fact, I feel that my story here must stop just as it begins to get really interesting. And finally, what about the magical number seven? What about the seven wonders of the world, the seven seas, the seven deadly sins, the seven daughters of Atlas in the Pleiades, the seven ages of man, the seven levels of hell, the seven primary colors, the seven notes of the musical scale, and the seven days of the week? What about the seven-point rating scale, the seven categories for absolute judgment, the seven objects in the span of attention, and the seven digits in the span of immediate memory? For the present I propose to withhold judgment. Perhaps there is something deep and profound behind all these sevens, something just calling out for us to discover it. But I suspect that it is only a pernicious, Pythagorean coincidence."

The possible influence of these eye-movement tendencies on perception was investigated in two experiments. In Experiment 1, errors in perceived location of intersection in arc figures were studied varying arc-point distance and are length. Tendencies 1 and 2 accounted very well for the resultant S-shaped functions. In Experiment 2, the M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion with three different oblique angles and a line-segment illusion were measured as a function of the distance between the vertex and the center of gravity of the arrowhead. Tendency 3 accounted well for the inverted-U forms of the obtained functions but not for the increase of error with increasing angle."

The effects of the geometric variables curve radius and curve angle, as well as the influence of experimental instructions, were assessed in a factorial laboratory experiment. Subjects estimated the magnitude of curvature of a series of stimulus curves in relation to a standard view. The results showed that decreasing the curve angle led to perceptual flattening of these curves. Reductions in curve radius resulted in a paradoxical decrease in perceived curvature. Judgments of curvature were the same for uninstructed subjects and those instructed in the meaning of physical curvature. These findings are in contrast to those expected from curve geometry and highlight an illusion in perceived curvature potentially harmful for curve negotiation on the road."

With line drawings as stimuli, RTs for Condition Ps were shorter than for Condition Pv, which in turn were shorter than for Condition Pd. Visual similarity had no effect on Pd RTs. However, in Experiment II, where photographs of objects with high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) names were used, no difference was found between Conditions Ps(HF), Ps(LF) and Condition Pv(HF); and no difference occurred between Conditions Pd(HF), Pd(LF) and Condition Pv(LF), the latter set of conditions being associated with longer RTs than the former. This pattern of results was found with both a .25-sec and a 2-sec ISI. The results are discussed in terms of the levels of coding involved in processing information from picture stimuli. It is concluded that at least two levels are involved in matching photographs of real objects (an object-code level and a nonvisual semantic code level), while a third level may be used in matching tasks involving stylized line drawings (a picture-code level)."

The results of four experiments established that each of these factors may be operative under appropriate circumstances. It was also concluded that component dimensions were processed simultaneously rather than sequentially. However, the processing was not truly parallel because the input channels were not independent of one another."

Moreover, there is a high consistency between different individuals as to the ordering of objects in respect of their naming latencies. It is further shown that a high correlation exists between the time taken to name an object and the frequency with which its name occurs in the language as a whole, as estimated in the Thorndike-Lorge Word List. Some implications of these findings are discussed, especially with reference to possible mechanisms by which presented objects are visually identified, and the appropriate names retrieved from the \u201cword-store.\u201d"

In contrast, subadults permitted to observe or interact fully with conspecifics during development exhibited attenuated discriminative flight activity. These findings suggest that visual experience with facing conspecifics, irrespective of physical contact, modifies the flight-eliciting properties of the innat mechanism subserving eye-schema recognition, but only during later maturation."

Recent social psychological research (Adams, 1977; Berscheid & Walster, 1974) attests to the salience and power of physical appearance in social interactions among adults. Our society\u2019s preoccupation with physical appearance, as reflected by the cosmetic, diet, and fashion industries, also points to the significance of this variable in everyday life."
