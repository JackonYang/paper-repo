We propose an unsupervised learning procedure based on Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis that discovers the relationship between how humans tag images (e.g., the order in which words are mentioned) and the relative importance of objects and their layout in the scene. Using this discovered connection, we show how to boost accuracy for novel queries, such that the search results may more closely match the user\u2019s mental image of the scene being sought. We evaluate our approach on two datasets, and show clear improvements over both an approach relying on image features alone, as well as a baseline that uses words and image features, but ignores the implied importance cues."

We propose a definition of importance and show how this may be estimated reliably from data harvested from human observers. We conclude by showing that a first-order estimate of importance may be computed from a number of simple image region measurements and does not require access to image meaning."

While intuition may point toward high-level object recognition and cognitive processes, here we investigate the contributions of a much simpler process, low-level visual saliency. We used the LabelMe database (24,863 photographs with 74,454 manually outlined objects) to evaluate how often interesting objects were among the few most salient locations predicted by a computational model of bottom-up attention. In 43% of all images the model's predicted most salient location falls within a labeled region (chance 21%). Furthermore, in 76% of the images (chance 43%), one or more of the top three salient locations fell on an outlined object, with performance leveling off after six predicted locations. The bottom-up attention model has neither notion of object nor notion of semantic relevance.

We aim to separate visual text---descriptions of what is being seen---from non-visual text in natural images and their descriptions. To do so, we first concretely define what it means to be visual, annotate visual text and then develop algorithms to automatically classify noun phrases as visual or non-visual. We find that using text alone, we are able to achieve high accuracies at this task, and that incorporating features derived from computer vision algorithms improves performance. Finally, we show that we can reliably mine visual nouns and adjectives from large corpora and that we can use these effectively in the classification task."

We describe a system that can compute a score linking an image to a sentence. This score can be used to attach a descriptive sentence to a given image, or to obtain images that illustrate a given sentence. The score is obtained by comparing an estimate of meaning obtained from the image to one obtained from the sentence. Each estimate of meaning comes from a discriminative procedure that is learned us-ingdata. We evaluate on a novel dataset consisting of human-annotated images. While our underlying estimate of meaning is impoverished, it is sufficient to produce very good quantitative results, evaluated with a novel score that can account for synecdoche."

We assume images are labeled with category, but not location, of an instance. We estimate models with an iterative procedure: the current model is used to produce a saliency score, which, together with a homogeneity cue, identifies likely locations for the object (resp. attribute); then those locations are used to produce better models with multiple instance learning. Crucially, the object and attribute models must agree on the potential locations of an object. This means that the more accurate of the two models can guide the improvement of the less accurate model. Our method is evaluated on two data sets of images of real scenes, one in which the attribute is color and the other in which it is material. We show that our joint learning produces improved detectors. We demonstrate generalization by detecting attribute-object pairs which do not appear in our training data. The iteration gives significant improvement in performance."

In particular, humans can recognize tens of thousands of object classes and scenes. No computer vision algorithm today has been tested at this scale. This paper presents a study of large scale categorization including a series of challenging experiments on classification with more than 10, 000 image classes. We find that a) computational issues become crucial in algorithm design; b) conventional wisdom from a couple of hundred image categories on relative performance of different classifiers does not necessarily hold when the number of categories increases; c) there is a surprisingly strong relationship between the structure of WordNet (developed for studying language) and the difficulty of visual categorization; d) classification can be improved by exploiting the semantic hierarchy. Toward the future goal of developing automatic vision algorithms to recognize tens of thousands or even millions of image categories, we make a series of observations and arguments about dataset scale, category density, and image hierarchy."

In order to scale the use of these describable visual attributes to a large number of categories, especially those not well studied by psychologists or linguists, it will be necessary to find alternative techniques for identifying attribute vocabularies and for learning to recognize attributes without hand labeled training data. We demonstrate that it is possible to accomplish both these tasks automatically by mining text and image data sampled from the Internet. The proposed approach also characterizes attributes according to their visual representation: global or local, and type: color, texture, or shape. This work focuses on discovering attributes and their visual appearance, and is as agnostic as possible about the textual description."

Unlike most previous work that summarizes or retrieves pre-existing text relevant to an image, our method composes sentences entirely from scratch.

Doing so allows us not only to name familiar objects, but also: to report unusual aspects of a familiar object (\u201cspotty dog\u201d, not just \u201cdog\u201d); to say something about unfamiliar objects (\u201chairy and four-legged\u201d, not just \u201cunknown\u201d); and to learn how to recognize new objects with few or no visual examples. Rather than focusing on identity assignment, we make inferring attributes the core problem of recognition. These attributes can be semantic (\u201cspotty\u201d) or discriminative (\u201cdogs have it but sheep do not\u201d). Learning attributes presents a major new challenge: generalization across object categories, not just across instances within a category. In this paper, we also introduce a novel feature selection method for learning attributes that generalize well across categories. We support our claims by thorough evaluation that provides insights into the limitations of the standard recognition paradigm of naming and demonstrates the new abilities provided by our attribute-based framework."

The first part, content planning, smooths the output of computer vision-based detection and recognition algorithms with statistics mined from large pools of visually descriptive text to determine the best content words to use to describe an image. The second step, surface realization, chooses words to construct natural language sentences based on the predicted content and general statistics from natural language. We present multiple approaches for the surface realization step and evaluate each using automatic measures of similarity to human generated reference descriptions. We also collect forced choice human evaluations between descriptions from the proposed generation system and descriptions from competing approaches. The proposed system is very effective at producing relevant sentences for images. It also generates descriptions that are notably more true to the specific image content than previous work."

The potential benefit from this source is made more significant due to the enormous amount of language data easily available today. We present a system to automatically generate natural language descriptions from images that exploits both statistics gleaned from parsing large quantities of text data and recognition algorithms from computer vision. The system is very effective at producing relevant sentences for images. It also generates descriptions that are notably more true to the specific image content than previous work."

However, scene understanding research has been constrained by the limited scope of currently-used databases which do not capture the full variety of scene categories. Whereas standard databases for object categorization contain hundreds of different classes of objects, the largest available dataset of scene categories contains only 15 classes. In this paper we propose the extensive Scene UNderstanding (SUN) database that contains 899 categories and 130,519 images. We use 397 well-sampled categories to evaluate numerous state-of-the-art algorithms for scene recognition and establish new bounds of performance. We measure human scene classification performance on the SUN database and compare this with computational methods. Additionally, we study a finer-grained scene representation to detect scenes embedded inside of larger scenes."

Such data is useful for supervised learning and quantitative evaluation. To achieve this, we developed a web-based tool that allows easy image annotation and instant sharing of such annotations. Using this annotation tool, we have collected a large dataset that spans many object categories, often containing multiple instances over a wide variety of images. We quantify the contents of the dataset and compare against existing state of the art datasets used for object recognition and detection. Also, we show how to extend the dataset to automatically enhance object labels with WordNet, discover object parts, recover a depth ordering of objects in a scene, and increase the number of labels using minimal user supervision and images from the web.\n"

Most approaches use co-occurrence of \"nouns\" and image features over large datasets to determine the correspondence, but many correspondence ambiguities remain. We further constrain the correspondence problem by exploiting additional language constructs to improve the learning process from weakly labeled data. We consider both \"prepositions\" and \"comparative adjectives\" which are used to express relationships between objects. If the models of such relationships can be determined, they help resolve correspondence ambiguities. However, learning models of these relationships requires solving the correspondence problem. We simultaneously learn the visual features defining \"nouns\" and the differential visual features defining such \"binary-relationships\" using an EM-based approach."

Such a collection allows us to approach the extremely challenging problem of description generation using relatively simple non-parametric methods and produces surprisingly effective results. We also develop methods incorporating many state of the art, but fairly noisy, estimates of image content to produce even more pleasing results.

When people play the game they help determine the contents of images by providing meaningful labels for them. If the game is played as much as popular online games, we estimate that most images on the Web can be labeled in a few months. Having proper labels associated with each image on the Web would allow for more accurate image search, improve the accessibility of sites (by providing descriptions of images to visually impaired individuals), and help users block inappropriate images. Our system makes a significant contribution because of its valuable output and because of the way it addresses the image-labeling problem. Rather than using computer vision techniques, which don't work well enough, we encourage people to do the work by taking advantage of their desire to be entertained."

This image retrieval benchmark (referred to as the IAPR TC-12 Benchmark) has developed from an initiative started by the Technical Committee 12 (TC-12) of the International Association of Pattern Recognition (IAPR). The collection consists of 20,000 images from a private photographic image collection. The construction and composition of the IAPR TC-12 Benchmark is described, including its associated text captions which are expressed in multiple languages, making the collection well-suited for evaluating the effectiveness of both textbased and visual retrieval methods. We also discuss the current and expected uses of the collection, including its use to benchmark and compare different image retrieval systems in ImageCLEF 2006."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

However, MTurk offers only limited control over who is allowed to particpate in a particular task. This is particularly problematic for tasks requiring free-form text entry. Unlike multiple-choice tasks there is no correct answer, and therefore control items for which the correct answer is known cannot be used. Furthermore, MTurk has no effective built-in mechanism to guarantee workers are proficient English writers. We describe our experience in creating corpora of images annotated with multiple one-sentence descriptions on MTurk and explore the effectiveness of different quality control strategies for collecting linguistic data using Mechanical MTurk. We find that the use of a qualification test provides the highest improvement of quality, whereas refining the annotations through follow-up tasks works rather poorly. Using our best setup, we construct two image corpora, totaling more than 40,000 descriptive captions for 9000 images."

There are two main reasons for the limited effort on large-scale image classification. First, until the emergence of ImageNet dataset, there was almost no publicly available large-scale benchmark data for image classification. This is mostly because class labels are expensive to obtain. Second, large-scale classification is hard because it poses more challenges than its medium-scale counterparts. A key challenge is how to achieve efficiency in both feature extraction and classifier training without compromising performance. This paper is to show how we address this challenge using ImageNet dataset as an example. For feature extraction, we develop a Hadoop scheme that performs feature extraction in parallel using hundreds of mappers. This allows us to extract fairly sophisticated features (with dimensions being hundreds of thousands) on 1.2 million images within one day. For SVM training, we develop a parallel averaging stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) algorithm for training one-against-all 1000-class SVM classifiers. The ASGD algorithm is capable of dealing with terabytes of training data and converges very fast\u2013typically 5 epochs are sufficient. As a result, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet 1000-class classification, i.e., 52.9% in classification accuracy and 71.8% in top 5 hit rate."

Many hand-crafted descriptors have been proposed in the literature for measuring visual similarity. Looking past initial differences, what really distinguishes one descriptor from another is the tradeoff that it achieves between discriminative power and invariance. Since this trade-off must vary from task to task, no single descriptor can be optimal in all situations. Our focus, in this paper, is on learning the optimal tradeoff for classification given a particular training set and prior constraints. The problem is posed in the kernel learning framework. We learn the optimal, domain-specific kernel as a combination of base kernels corresponding to base features which achieve different levels of trade-off (such as no invariance, rotation invariance, scale invariance, affine invariance, etc.) This leads to a convex optimisation problem with a unique global optimum which can be solved for efficiently. The method is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the UIUC textures, Oxford flowers and Cal- tech 101 datasets."

Two groups of English and Chinese verbs are examined to show that lexical selection must be based on interpretation of the sentences as well as selection restrictions placed on the verb arguments. A novel representation scheme is suggested, and is compared to representations with selection restrictions used in transfer-based MT. We see our approach as closely aligned with knowledge-based MT approaches (KBMT), and as a separate component that could be incorporated into existing systems. Examples and experimental results will show that, using this scheme, inexact matches can achieve correct lexical selection."
