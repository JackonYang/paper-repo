Several critical functions have been investigated and the technical approaches are discussed. The first is the segmentation and classification of digitized printed documents into regions of text and images. A nonlinear, run-length smoothing algorithm has been used for this purpose. By using the regular features of text lines, a linear adaptive classification scheme discriminates text regions from others. The second technique studied is an adaptive approach to the recognition of the hundreds of font styles and sizes that can occur on printed documents. A preclassifier is constructed during the input process and used to speed up a well-known pattern-matching method for clustering characters from an arbitrary print source into a small sample of prototypes. Experimental results are included."

It is intended for use in an automated system for document analysis. The principal parts of the algorithm are the generation of connected components and the application of the Hough transform in order to group components into logical character strings that can then be separated from the graphics. The algorithm outputs two images, one containing text strings and the other graphics. These images can then be processed by suitable character recognition and graphics recognition systems. The performance of the algorithm, both in terms of its effectiveness and computational efficiency, was evaluated using several test images and showed superior performance compared to other techniques. >"

A language FDL, Form Definition Language, is first introduced which can represent generic layout structures as a set of rectangular regions, each of which are recursively defined in terms of inclusive rectangular regions. To identify concrete layout structures, the generic descriptions are matched against input document images, and specific items on a page are extracted. Although this approach is powerful, it is rather complex and a simplification is possible. A language SFDL, a simplified version of FDL, can be used for rather regular document forms to describe characteristic patterns of the document form in terms of templates. Templates are rectangular regions among which spatial constraints are defined without recursions. By matching such templates, input document images can be classified, and bibliographic items such as a title and author\u2019s name can be extracted. Experiments have shown promising results and it can be applied to an automatic document filing system."

The system combines several techniques in order to improve the overall recognition rate. Thinning and shape extraction are performed directly on a graph of the run-length encoding of a binary image. The resulting strokes and other shapes are mapped, using a shape-clustering approach, into binary features which are then fed into a statistical Bayesian classifier. Large-scale trials have shown better than 97 percent top choice correct performance on mixtures of six dissimilar fonts, and over 99 percent on most single fonts, over a range of point sizes. Certain remaining confusion classes are disambiguated through contour analysis, and characters suspected of being merged are broken and reclassified. Finally, layout and linguistic context are applied. The results are illustrated by sample pages."

Several component processes of a recognition system for isolated offline cursive script words are described. A word image is transformed through a hierarchy of representation levels: points, contours, features, letters, and words. A unique feature representation is generated bottom-up from the image using statistical dependences between letters and features. Ratings for partially formed words are computed using a stack algorithm and a lexicon represented as a trie. Several novel techniques for low- and intermediate-level processing for cursive script are described, including heuristics for reference line finding, letter segmentation based on detecting local minima along the lower contour and areas with low vertical profiles, simultaneous encoding of contours and their topological relationships, extracting features, and finding shape-oriented events. Experiments demonstrating the performance of the system are also described. >"

Then, the techniques in artificial intelligence required to realize this system are discussed. The approaches proposed here are document understanding and knowledge-based filing. The document understanding technology may automate document image analysis and information extraction using character recognition. A method of image segmentation using layout knowledge is described. Knowledge-based filing, on the other hand, can ease the user to register and retrieve documents with the help of inference applied to domain specific knowledge. Software simulations and experiments on a prototype system are also described."

The resulting system can deal with a wide range of environments: from those having a high degree of global spatial structure (e.g. mail envelopes which conform to specifications) to those with no structure (e.g. magazines with randomly pasted address labels). The problem-solving architecture accounts for uncertainty in the imaging environment by using the blackboard model. The system consists of several specialized tools and a control structure so that the tools are opportunistically invoked and coordinated.

Both from the practical and the academic point of view, very encouraging results are reported. The work is described systematically and analyzed in terms of so-called feature matching, which is likely to be the mainstream of the research and development of machine recognition of handprinted Chinese characters. A database, ETL8 (881 Kanji, 71 hirakana, and 160 variations for each category), is explained, on which many experiments were performed. Recognition rates reported using this database can be compared, and so somewhat qualitative evaluation of these methods is described. Based on the comparative study, the merits and demerits of both feature and structural matching are discussed and some future directions are mentioned."

A continuous string without delimiting space is recognized in real time by using this algorithm. Errors and rejects of an optical character reader arc corrected to meaningful characters with the help of a dictionary. This algorithm uses a finite state automaton (FSA); the FSA's transition table is condensed by the representation device of the FSA to reduce the processing time of table generation and state transitions. Words can be extracted from any position in the continuous string. The recognition process is 6.8 times faster than a conventional automaton-type algorithm. The algorithm was run on 5,032 handwritten Japanese sample addresses. In the experiment, 96.6 percent of the recognition errors and rejects wcrc corrected in real time."
