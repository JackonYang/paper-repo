The user marks certain pixels as \"object\" or \"background\" to provide hard constraints for segmentation. Additional soft constraints incorporate both boundary and region information. Graph cuts are used to find the globally optimal segmentation of the N-dimensional image. The obtained solution gives the best balance of boundary and region properties among all segmentations satisfying the constraints. The topology of our segmentation is unrestricted and both \"object\" and \"background\" segments may consist of several isolated parts. Some experimental results are presented in the context of photo/video editing and medical image segmentation. We also demonstrate an interesting Gestalt example. A fast implementation of our segmentation method is possible via a new max-flow algorithm."

Our approach models both the foreground and background color distributions with spatially-varying sets of Gaussians, and assumes a fractional blending of the foreground and background colors to produce the final output. It then uses a maximum-likelihood criterion to estimate the optimal opacity, foreground and background simultaneously. In addition to providing a principled approach to the matting problem, our algorithm effectively handles objects with intricate boundaries, such as hair strands and fur, and provides an improvement over existing techniques for these difficult cases."

Natural images contain both textured and untextured regions, so the cues of contour and texture differences are exploited simultaneously. Contours are treated in the intervening contour framework, while texture is analyzed using textons. Each of these cues has a domain of applicability, so to facilitate cue combination we introduce a gating operator based on the texturedness of the neighborhood at a pixel. Having obtained a local measure of how likely two nearby pixels are to belong to the same region, we use the spectral graph theoretic framework of normalized cuts to find partitions of the image into regions of coherent texture and brightness. Experimental results on a wide range of images are shown."

We propose a technique for estimating alpha, the proportion in which two colors mix to produce a color at the boundary. The technique extends blue screen matting to backgrounds that have almost arbitrary color distributions, though coarse knowledge of the boundary's location is required.

Smith in the Chair] SUMMARY A continuous two-dimensional region is partitioned into a fine rectangular array of sites or \"pixels\", each pixel having a particular \"colour\" belonging to a prescribed finite set. The true colouring of the region is unknown but, associated with each pixel, there is a possibly multivariate record which conveys imperfect information about its colour according to a known statistical model. The aim is to reconstruct the true scene, with the additional knowledge that pixels close together tend to have the same or similar colours. In this paper, it is assumed that the local characteristics of the true scene can be represented by a nondegenerate Markov random field. Such information can be combined with the records by Bayes' theorem and the true scene can be estimated according to standard criteria. However, the computational burden is enormous and the reconstruction may reflect undesirable largescale properties of the random field. Thus, a simple, iterative method of reconstruction is proposed, which does not depend on these large-scale characteristics. The method is illustrated by computer simulations in which the original scene is not directly related to the assumed random field. Some complications, including parameter estimation, are discussed. Potential applications are mentioned briefly."

We do not consider the problem of texture synthesis, but the problem of extracting textural features for tasks such as image segmentation. We take into account nonstationarities occurring in the local mean. We focus on Gaussian Markov random fields for which two estimation methods are proposed, and applied in a nonstationary framework. The first one consists of extracting conditional probabilities and performing a least square approximation. This method is applied to a nonstationary framework, dealing with the piecewise constant local mean. This framework is adapted to practical tasks when discriminating several textures on a single image. The blurring effect affecting edges between two different textures is thus reduced. The second proposed method is based on renormalization theory. Statistics involved only concern variances of Gaussian laws, leading to Cramer-Rao estimators. This method is thus especially robust with respect to the size of sampling. Moreover, nonstationarities of the local mean do not affect results. We then demonstrate that the estimated parameters allow texture discrimination for remote sensing data. The first proposed estimation method is applied to extract urban areas from SPOT images. Since discontinuities of the local mean are taken into account, we obtain an accurate urban areas delineation. Finally, we apply the renormalization based on method to segment ice in polar regions from AVHRR data."

The discriminative random fields offer several advantages over the conventional Markov random field (MRF) framework. First, the DRFs allow to relax the strong assumption of conditional independence of the observed data generally used in the MRF framework for tractability. This assumption is too restrictive for a large number of applications in vision. Second, the DRFs derive their classification power by exploiting the probabilistic discriminative models instead of the generative models used in the MRF framework. Finally, all the parameters in the DRF model are estimated simultaneously from the training data unlike the MRF framework where likelihood parameters are usually learned separately from the field parameters. We illustrate the advantages of the DRFs over the MRF framework in an application of man-made structure detection in natural images taken from the Corel database."

Each of these techniques constructs a graph such that the minimum cut on the graph also minimizes the energy. Yet, because these graph constructions are complex and highly specific to a particular energy function, graph cuts have seen limited application to date. In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph. A software implementation is freely available."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."
