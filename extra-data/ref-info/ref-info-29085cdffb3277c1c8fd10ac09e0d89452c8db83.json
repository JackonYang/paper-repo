                "text": "We consider problems of sequence processing and we propose a solution based on a discrete state model. We introduce a recurrent architecture having a modular structure that allocates subnetworks to discrete states. Di erent subnetworks are model the dynamics (state transition) and the output of the model, conditional on the previous state and an external input. The model has a statistical interpretation and can be trained by the EM or GEM algorithms, considering state trajectories as missing data. This allows to decouple temporal credit assignment and actual parameters estimation. The model presents similarities to hidden Markov models, but allows to map input sequences to output sequences, using the same processing style of recurrent networks. For this reason we call it Input/Output HMM (IOHMM). Another remarkable di erence is that IOHMMs are trained using a supervised learning paradigm (while potentially taking advantage of the EM algorithm), whereas standard HMMs are trained by an unsupervised EM algorithm (or a supervised criterion with gradient ascent). We also study the problem of learning long-term dependencies with Markovian systems, making comparisons to recurrent networks trained by gradient descent. The analysis reported in this paper shows that Markovian models generally su er from a problem of di usion of temporal credit for long-term dependencies and fully connected transition graphs. However, while recurrent networks exhibit a con ict between long-term information storing and trainability, these two requirements are either both satis ed or both not satis ed in Markovian models. Finally, we demonstrate that EM supervised learning is well suited for solving grammatical inference problems. Experimental results are presented for the seven Tomita grammars, showing that these adaptive models can attain excellent generalization. 1"

A discriminant hidden Markov model (HMM) is defined, and it is shown how a particular MLP with contextual and extra feedback input units can be considered as a general form of such a Markov model. A link between these discriminant HMMs, trained along the Viterbi algorithm, and any other approach based on least mean square minimization of an error function (LMSE) is established. It is shown theoretically and experimentally that the outputs of the MLP (when trained along the LMSE or the entropy criterion) approximate the probability distribution over output classes conditioned on the input, i.e. the maximum a posteriori probabilities. Results of a series of speech recognition experiments are reported. The possibility of embedding MLP into HMM is described. Relations with other recurrent networks are also explained. >"

However, practical difficulties have been reported in training recurrent neural networks to perform tasks in which the temporal contingencies present in the input/output sequences span long intervals. We show why gradient based learning algorithms face an increasingly difficult problem as the duration of the dependencies to be captured increases. These results expose a trade-off between efficient learning by gradient descent and latching on information for long periods. Based on an understanding of this problem, alternatives to standard gradient descent are considered."

We show that once we have modified the output layer of a multilayer perceptron to provide mathematically correct probability distributions, and replaced the usual squared error criterion with a probability-based score, the result is equivalent to Maximum Mutual Information training, which has been used successfully to improve the performance of hidden Markov models for speech recognition. If the network is specially constructed to perform the recognition computations of a given kind of stochastic model based classifier then we obtain a method for discrimination-based training of the parameters of the models. Examples include an HMM-based word discriminator, which we call an 'Alphanet'."

We present simulations that show the effect of initial conditions, training set size and order, and neural network architecture. All simulations were performed with random initial weight strengths and usually converge after approximately a hundred epochs of training. We discuss a quantization algorithm for dynamically extracting finite state automata during and after training. For a well-trained neural net, the extracted automata constitute an equivalence class of state machines that are reducible to the minimal machine of the inferred grammar. We then show through simulations that many of the neural net state machines are dynamically stable, that is, they correctly classify many long unseen strings. In addition, some of these extracted automata actually outperform the trained neural network for classification of unseen strings."

This is followed by a detailed discussion of three issues not treated in the literature: alternatives to the Baum-Welch algorithm; critical facets of the implementation of the algorithms, with emphasis on their numerical properties; and behavior of Markov models on certain artificial but realistic problems. Special attention is given to a particular class of Markov models, which we call \u201cleft-to-right\u201d models. This class of models is especially appropriate for isolated word recognition. The results of the application of these methods to an isolated word, speaker-independent speech recognition experiment are given in a companion paper."

Although variants of back propagation can in principle be used to find structure in sequences, in practice they are not sufficiently powerful to discover arbitrary contingencies, especially those spanning long temporal intervals or involving high order statistics. For example, in designing a connectionist network for music composition, we have encountered the problem that the net is able to learn musical structure that occurs locally in time--e.g., relations among notes within a musical phrase--but not structure that occurs over longer time periods--e.g., relations among phrases. To address this problem, we require a means of constructing a reduced description of the sequence that makes global aspects more explicit or more readily detectable. I propose to achieve this using hidden units that operate with different time constants. Simulation experiments indicate that slower time-scale hidden units are able to pick up global structure, structure that simply can not be learned by standard back propagation."
