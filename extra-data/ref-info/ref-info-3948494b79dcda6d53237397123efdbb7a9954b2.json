In this paper we investigate the problem of optimal compression of propositional Horn production rule knowledge bases. The standard approach to this problem, consisting in the removal of redundant rules from a knowledge base, leads to an \"irredundant\" but not necessarily optimal knowledge base. We prove here that the number of rules in any irredundant Horn knowledge base involving n propositional variables is at most n 0 1 times the minimum possible number of rules. In order to formalize the optimal compression problem, we define a Boolean function of a knowledge base as being the function whose set of true points is the set of models of the knowledge base. In this way the optimal compression of production rule knowledge bases becomes a problem of Boolean function minimization. In this paper we prove that the minimization of Horn functions (i.e. Boolean functions associated to Horn knowledge bases) is..."

Our methods lead to a unified treatment of some of Valiant's results, along with previous results of Pearl and Devroye and Wagner on distribution-free convergence of certain pattern recognition algorithms. We show that the essential condition for distribution-free learnability is finiteness of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, a simple combinatorial parameter of the class of concepts to be learned. Using this parameter, we analyze the complexity and closure properties of learnable classes. Authors A. Blumer and D. Haussler gratefully acknowledge the support of NSF grant IST-8317918, author A.

The particular problems we consider are: finding Hamiltonian circuits in directed graphs (DHC), finding Hamiltonian circuits in undirected graphs (UHC), and finding perfect matchings in undirected graphs (PM). We show that for each problem there is an algorithm that is extremely fast (0(n(log n)2) for DHC and UHC, and 0(nlog n) for PM), and which with probability tending to one finds a solution in randomly chosen graphs of sufficient density. These results contrast with the known NP-completeness of the first two problems [2,12] and the best worst-case upper bound known of 0(n2.5) for the last [9]."

In this paper we regard learning as the phenomenon of knowledge acquisition in the absence of explicit programming. We give a precise methodology for studying this phenomenon from a computational viewpoint. It consists of choosing an appropriate information gathering mechanism, the learning protocol, and exploring the class of concepts that can be learnt using it in a reasonable (polynomial) number of steps. We find that inherent algorithmic complexity appears to set serious limits to the range of concepts that can be so learnt. The methodology and results suggest concrete principles for designing realistic learning systems."

In this paper the complexity and performance of algorithms which construct such colorings are investigated. For a graph G, let &khgr;(G) denote the minimum possible number of colors required to color G and, for any graph coloring algorithm A, let A(G) denote the number of colors used by A when applied to G. Since the graph coloring problem is known to be \u201cNP-complete,\u201d it is considered unlikely that any efficient algorithm can guarantee A(G) = &khgr;(G) for all input graphs. In this paper it is proved that even coming close to khgr;(G) with a fast algorithm is hard. Specifically, it is shown that if for some constant r < 2 and constant d there exists a polynomial-time algorithm A which guarantees A(G) \u2264 r\u00b7&khgr;(G) + d, then there also exists a polynomial-time algorithm A which guarantees A(G) = &khgr;(G)."
