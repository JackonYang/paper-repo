To our knowledge, this is the first model that performs all three tasks in one coherent framework. For instance, a scene of a `polo game' consists of several visual objects such as `human', `horse', `grass', etc. In addition, it can be further annotated with a list of more abstract (e.g. `dusk') or visually less salient (e.g. `saddle') tags. Our generative model jointly explains images through a visual model and a textual model. Visually relevant objects are represented by regions and patches, while visually irrelevant textual annotations are influenced directly by the overall scene class. We propose a fully automatic learning framework that is able to learn robust scene models from noisy Web data such as images and user tags from Flickr.com. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by automatically classifying, annotating and segmenting images from eight classes depicting sport scenes. In all three tasks, our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms."

We adopt the bag-of-visual-words architecture which has proven successful in achieving high precision at low recall. Unfortunately, feature detection and quantization are noisy processes and this can result in variation in the particular visual words that appear in different images of the same object, leading to missed results. In the text retrieval literature a standard method for improving performance is query expansion. A number of the highly ranked documents from the original query are reissued as a new query. In this way, additional relevant terms can be added to the query. This is a form of blind rele- vance feedback and it can fail if 'outlier' (false positive) documents are included in the reissued query. In this paper we bring query expansion into the visual domain via two novel contributions. Firstly, strong spatial constraints between the query image and each result allow us to accurately verify each return, suppressing the false positives which typically ruin text-based query expansion. Secondly, the verified images can be used to learn a latent feature model to enable the controlled construction of expanded queries. We illustrate these ideas on the 5000 annotated image Oxford building database together with more than 1M Flickr images. We show that the precision is substantially boosted, achieving total recall in many cases."

In this paper we learn the visual features that correspond to semantic phrases derived from sentences. Specifically, we extract predicate tuples that contain two nouns and a relation. The relation may take several forms, such as a verb, preposition, adjective or their combination. We model a scene using a Conditional Random Field (CRF) formulation where each node corresponds to an object, and the edges to their relations. We determine the potentials of the CRF using the tuples extracted from the sentences. We generate novel scenes depicting the sentences' visual meaning by sampling from the CRF. The CRF is also used to score a set of scenes for a text-based image retrieval task. Our results show we can generate (retrieve) scenes that convey the desired semantic meaning, even when scenes (queries) are described by multiple sentences. Significant improvement is found over several baseline approaches."

The model density and complexity of the scenes representing these virtual environments is rising rapidly. This trend suggests that data-mining a 3D scene corpus could be a very powerful tool enabling more efficient scene design. In this paper, we show how to represent scenes as graphs that encode models and their semantic relationships. We then define a kernel between these relationship graphs that compares common virtual substructures in two graphs and captures the similarity between their corresponding scenes. We apply this framework to several scene modeling problems, such as finding similar scenes, relevance feedback, and context-based model search. We show that incorporating structural relationships allows our method to provide a more relevant set of results when compared against previous approaches to model context search."

In analogy to image search, we propose to frame sentence-based image annotation as the task of ranking a given pool of captions. We introduce a new benchmark collection for sentence-based image description and search, consisting of 8,000 images that are each paired with five different captions which provide clear descriptions of the salient entities and events. We introduce a number of systems that perform quite well on this task, even though they are only based on features that can be obtained with minimal supervision. Our results clearly indicate the importance of training on multiple captions per image, and of capturing syntactic (word order-based) and semantic features of these captions. We also perform an in-depth comparison of human and automatic evaluation metrics for this task, and propose strategies for collecting human judgments cheaply and on a very large scale, allowing us to augment our collection with additional relevance judgments of which captions describe which image. Our analysis shows that metrics that consider the ranked list of results for each query image or sentence are significantly more robust than metrics that are based on a single response per query. Moreover, our study suggests that the evaluation of ranking-based image description systems may be fully automated."

The semantic meaning of images depends on the presence of objects, their attributes and their relations to other objects. But precisely characterizing this dependence requires extracting complex visual information from an image, which is in general a difficult and yet unsolved problem. In this paper, we propose studying semantic information in abstract images created from collections of clip art. Abstract images provide several advantages. They allow for the direct study of how to infer high-level semantic information, since they remove the reliance on noisy low-level object, attribute and relation detectors, or the tedious hand-labeling of images. Importantly, abstract images also allow the ability to generate sets of semantically similar scenes. Finding analogous sets of semantically similar real images would be nearly impossible. We create 1,002 sets of 10 semantically similar abstract scenes with corresponding written descriptions. We thoroughly analyze this dataset to discover semantically important features, the relations of words to visual features and methods for measuring semantic similarity."

We focus on rare object classes, which play an important role in achieving richer semantic understanding of visual scenes, compared to common background classes. Towards this end, we make two novel contributions: rare class expansion and semantic context description. First, considering the long-tailed nature of the label distribution, we expand the retrieval set by rare class exemplars and thus achieve more balanced superpixel classification results. Second, we incorporate both global and local semantic context information through a feedback based mechanism to refine image retrieval and superpixel matching.

While most previous approaches are either limited to special kinds of queries, or do not scale to large image sets, we propose a new method, efficient subimage retrieval (ESR), that is at the same time very flexible and very efficient. Relying on a two-layered branch-and-bound setup, ESR performs object-based image retrieval in sets of 100,000 or more images within seconds. An extensive evaluation on several datasets shows that ESR is not only very fast, but it also achieves excellent detection accuracies thereby improving over previous systems for object-based image retrieval."

However, existing techniques restrict these properties to categorical labels (for example, a person is \u2018smiling\u2019 or not, a scene is \u2018dry\u2019 or not), and thus fail to capture more general semantic relationships. We propose to model relative attributes. Given training data stating how object/scene categories relate according to different attributes, we learn a ranking function per attribute. The learned ranking functions predict the relative strength of each property in novel images. We then build a generative model over the joint space of attribute ranking outputs, and propose a novel form of zero-shot learning in which the supervisor relates the unseen object category to previously seen objects via attributes (for example, \u2018bears are furrier than giraffes\u2019). We further show how the proposed relative attributes enable richer textual descriptions for new images, which in practice are more precise for human interpretation. We demonstrate the approach on datasets of faces and natural scenes, and show its clear advantages over traditional binary attribute prediction for these new tasks."

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called \u201cImageNet\u201d, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond."

Context models can efficiently rule out some unlikely combinations or locations of objects and guide detectors to produce a semantically coherent interpretation of a scene. However, the performance benefit from using context models has been limited because most of these methods were tested on datasets with only a few object categories, in which most images contain only one or two object categories. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset with images that contain many instances of different object categories and propose an efficient model that captures the contextual information among more than a hundred of object categories. We show that our context model can be applied to scene understanding tasks that local detectors alone cannot solve."

Our approach exploits object appearance, motion and spatial relations, and learns the importance of each term using structure prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a new dataset designed for semantic search in the context of autonomous driving, which exhibits complex and highly dynamic scenes with many objects. We show that our approach is able to locate a major portion of the objects described in the query with high accuracy, and improve the relevance in video retrieval."

Such data is useful for supervised learning and quantitative evaluation. To achieve this, we developed a web-based tool that allows easy image annotation and instant sharing of such annotations. Using this annotation tool, we have collected a large dataset that spans many object categories, often containing multiple instances over a wide variety of images. We quantify the contents of the dataset and compare against existing state of the art datasets used for object recognition and detection. Also, we show how to extend the dataset to automatically enhance object labels with WordNet, discover object parts, recover a depth ordering of objects in a scene, and increase the number of labels using minimal user supervision and images from the web.\n"

Given photos of a sports event, all that is necessary to provide a pixel-level labeling of objects and background is a set of newspaper articles about this sport and one to five labeled images. Our model is motivated by the observation that words in text corpora share certain context and feature similarities with visual objects. We describe images using visual words, a new region-based representation. The proposed model is based on kernelized canonical correlation analysis which finds a mapping between visual and textual words by projecting them into a latent meaning space. Kernels are derived from context and adjective features inside the respective visual and textual domains. We apply our method to a challenging dataset and rely on articles of the New York Times for textual features. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art in annotation. In segmentation it compares favorably with other methods that use significantly more labeled training data."

                "text": "With the popularity of \u201cbag of visual terms\u201d representations of images, many text indexing techniques have been applied in large-scale image retrieval systems. However, due to a fundamental difference between an image query (e.g. 1500 visual terms) and a text query (e.g. 3\u20135 terms), the usages of some text indexing techniques, e.g. inverted list, are misleading. In this work, we develop a novel indexing technique for this problem. The basic idea is to decompose a document-like representation of an image into two components, one for dimension reduction and the other for residual information preservation. The computing of similarity of two images can be transferred to measuring similarities of their components. The decomposition has two major merits: 1) these components have good properties which enable them to be efficiently indexed and retrieved; 2) The decomposition has better generalization ability than other dimension reduction algorithms. The decomposition can be achieved by either a graphical model or a matrix factorization approach. Theoretic analysis and extensive experiments over a 2.3 million image database show that this framework is scalable to index large scale image database to support fast and accurate visual search."

This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model."

Attributes are visual qualities of objects, such as 'red', 'striped', or 'spotted'. The model sees attributes as patterns of image segments, repeatedly sharing some characteristic properties. These can be any combination of appearance, shape, or the layout of segments within the pattern. Moreover, attributes with general appearance are taken into account, such as the pattern of alternation of any two colors which is characteristic for stripes. To enable learning from unsegmented training images, the model is learnt discriminatively, by optimizing a likelihood ratio. \n \nAs demonstrated in the experimental evaluation, our model can learn in a weakly supervised setting and encompasses a broad range of attributes. We show that attributes can be learnt starting from a text query to Google image search, and can then be used to recognize the attribute and determine its spatial extent in novel real-world images."

However, scene understanding research has been constrained by the limited scope of currently-used databases which do not capture the full variety of scene categories. Whereas standard databases for object categorization contain hundreds of different classes of objects, the largest available dataset of scene categories contains only 15 classes. In this paper we propose the extensive Scene UNderstanding (SUN) database that contains 899 categories and 130,519 images. We use 397 well-sampled categories to evaluate numerous state-of-the-art algorithms for scene recognition and establish new bounds of performance. We measure human scene classification performance on the SUN database and compare this with computational methods. Additionally, we study a finer-grained scene representation to detect scenes embedded inside of larger scenes."

The procedure is based on a very low dimensional representation of the scene, that we term the Spatial Envelope. We propose a set of perceptual dimensions (naturalness, openness, roughness, expansion, ruggedness) that represent the dominant spatial structure of a scene. Then, we show that these dimensions may be reliably estimated using spectral and coarsely localized information. The model generates a multidimensional space in which scenes sharing membership in semantic categories (e.g., streets, highways, coasts) are projected closed together. The performance of the spatial envelope model shows that specific information about object shape or identity is not a requirement for scene categorization and that modeling a holistic representation of the scene informs about its probable semantic category."

We present a hierarchical scene model for learning and reasoning about complex indoor scenes which is computationally tractable, can be learned from a reasonable amount of training data, and avoids oversimplification. At the core of this approach is the 3D Geometric Phrase Model which captures the semantic and geometric relationships between objects which frequently co-occur in the same 3D spatial configuration. Experiments show that this model effectively explains scene semantics, geometry and object groupings from a single image, while also improving individual object detections."

In this paper, we present an algorithm to parse indoor images based on two observations: i) The functionality is the most essential property to define an indoor object, e.g. \"a chair to sit on\", ii) The geometry (3D shape) of an object is designed to serve its function. We formulate the nature of the object function into a stochastic grammar model. This model characterizes a joint distribution over the function-geometry-appearance (FGA) hierarchy. The hierarchical structure includes a scene category, functional groups, functional objects, functional parts and 3D geometric shapes. We use a simulated annealing MCMC algorithm to find the maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution, i.e. a parse tree. We design four data-driven steps to accelerate the search in the FGA space: i) group the line segments into 3D primitive shapes, ii) assign functional labels to these 3D primitive shapes, iii) fill in missing objects/parts according to the functional labels, and iv) synthesize 2D segmentation maps and verify the current parse tree by the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probability. The experimental results on several challenging indoor datasets demonstrate the proposed approach not only significantly widens the scope of indoor scene parsing algorithm from the segmentation and the 3D recovery to the functional object recognition, but also yields improved overall performance."

Firstly, an all-in-all labeling framework is proposed to group visual knowledge of three levels: scene level (global geometric description), object level (segmentation, sketch representation, hierarchical decomposition), and low-mid level (2.1D layered representation, object boundary attributes, curve completion, etc.). Much of this data has not appeared in previous databases. In addition, And-Or Graph is used to organize visual elements to facilitate top-down labeling. An annotation tool is developed to realize and integrate all tasks. With this tool, we've been able to create a database consisting of more than 636,748 annotated images and video frames. Lastly, the data is organized into 13 common subsets to serve as benchmarks for diverse evaluation endeavors."

The descriptor is the output of a large number of weakly trained object category classifiers on the image. The trained categories are selected from an ontology of visual concepts, but the intention is not to encode an explicit decomposition of the scene. Rather, we accept that existing object category classifiers often encode not the category per se but ancillary image characteristics; and that these ancillary characteristics can combine to represent visual classes unrelated to the constituent categories' semantic meanings. \n \nThe advantage of this descriptor is that it allows object-category queries to be made against image databases using efficient classifiers (efficient at test time) such as linear support vector machines, and allows these queries to be for novel categories. Even when the representation is reduced to 200 bytes per image, classification accuracy on object category recognition is comparable with the state of the art (36% versus 42%), but at orders of magnitude lower computational cost."

We explicitly train it to distinguish objects with a well-defined boundary in space, such as cows and telephones, from amorphous background elements, such as grass and road. The measure combines in a Bayesian framework several image cues measuring characteristics of objects, such as appearing different from their surroundings and having a closed boundary. These include an innovative cue to measure the closed boundary characteristic. In experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC 07 dataset, we show this new cue to outperform a state-of-the-art saliency measure, and the combined objectness measure to perform better than any cue alone. We also compare to interest point operators, a HOG detector, and three recent works aiming at automatic object segmentation. Finally, we present two applications of objectness. In the first, we sample a small numberof windows according to their objectness probability and give an algorithm to employ them as location priors for modern class-specific object detectors. As we show experimentally, this greatly reduces the number of windows evaluated by the expensive class-specific model. In the second application, we use objectness as a complementary score in addition to the class-specific model, which leads to fewer false positives. As shown in several recent papers, objectness can act as a valuable focus of attention mechanism in many other applications operating on image windows, including weakly supervised learning of object categories, unsupervised pixelwise segmentation, and object tracking in video. Computing objectness is very efficient and takes only about 4 sec. per image."

We introduce selective search which combines the strength of both an exhaustive search and segmentation. Like segmentation, we use the image structure to guide our sampling process. Like exhaustive search, we aim to capture all possible object locations. Instead of a single technique to generate possible object locations, we diversify our search and use a variety of complementary image partitionings to deal with as many image conditions as possible. Our selective search results in a small set of data-driven, class-independent, high quality locations, yielding 99\u00a0% recall and a Mean Average Best Overlap of 0.879 at 10,097 locations. The reduced number of locations compared to an exhaustive search enables the use of stronger machine learning techniques and stronger appearance models for object recognition. In this paper we show that our selective search enables the use of the powerful Bag-of-Words model for recognition. The selective search software is made publicly available (Software: http://disi.unitn.it/~uijlings/SelectiveSearch.html)."

Unlike previous models that directly map images or sentences into a common embedding space, our model works on a finer level and embeds fragments of images (objects) and fragments of sentences (typed dependency tree relations) into a common space. We then introduce a structured max-margin objective that allows our model to explicitly associate these fragments across modalities. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that reasoning on both the global level of images and sentences and the finer level of their respective fragments improves performance on image-sentence retrieval tasks. Additionally, our model provides interpretable predictions for the image-sentence retrieval task since the inferred inter-modal alignment of fragments is explicit."

The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30% relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012 -- achieving a mAP of 53.3%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also present experiments that provide insight into what the network learns, revealing a rich hierarchy of image features. Source code for the complete system is available at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rbg/rcnn."

Visual phrases often display significantly reduced visual complexity compared to their component objects, because the appearance of those objects can change profoundly when they participate in relations. We introduce a dataset suitable for phrasal recognition that uses familiar PASCAL object categories, and demonstrate significant experimental gains resulting from exploiting visual phrases. We show that a visual phrase detector significantly outperforms a baseline which detects component objects and reasons about relations, even though visual phrase training sets tend to be smaller than those for objects. We argue that any multi-class detection system must decode detector outputs to produce final results; this is usually done with non-maximum suppression. We describe a novel decoding procedure that can account accurately for local context without solving difficult inference problems. We show this decoding procedure outperforms the state of the art. Finally, we show that decoding a combination of phrasal and object detectors produces real improvements in detector results."

Towards this goal, we label every pixel of PASCAL VOC 2010 detection challenge with a semantic category. We believe this data will provide plenty of challenges to the community, as it contains 520 additional classes for semantic segmentation and object detection. Our analysis shows that nearest neighbor based approaches perform poorly on semantic segmentation of contextual classes, showing the variability of PASCAL imagery. Furthermore, improvements of existing contextual models for detection is rather modest. In order to push forward the performance in this difficult scenario, we propose a novel deformable part-based model, which exploits both local context around each candidate detection as well as global context at the level of the scene. We show that this contextual reasoning significantly helps in detecting objects at all scales."

                "text": "In this paper, we study the problem of large scale image retrieval by developing a new class of bag-of-features to encode geometric information of objects within an image. Beyond existing orderless bag-of-features, local features of an image are first projected to different directions or points to generate a series of ordered bag-of-features, based on which different families of spatial bag-of-features are designed to capture the invariance of object translation, rotation, and scaling. Then the most representative features are selected based on a boosting-like method to generate a new bag-of-features-like vector representation of an image. The proposed retrieval framework works well in image retrieval task owing to the following three properties: 1) the encoding of geometric information of objects for capturing objects' spatial transformation, 2) the supervised feature selection and combination strategy for enhancing the discriminative power, and 3) the representation of bag-of-features for effective image matching and indexing for large scale image retrieval. Extensive experiments on 5000 Oxford building images and 1 million Panoramio images show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed features as well as the retrieval framework."

                "text": "Many state-of-the-art approaches for object recognition reduce the problem to a 0-1 classification task. This allows one to leverage sophisticated machine learning techniques for training classifiers from labeled examples. However, these models are typically trained independently for each class using positive and negative examples cropped from images. At test-time, various post-processing heuristics such as non-maxima suppression (NMS) are required to reconcile multiple detections within and between different classes for each image. Though crucial to good performance on benchmarks, this post-processing is usually defined heuristically.We introduce a unified model for multi-class object recognition that casts the problem as a structured prediction task. Rather than predicting a binary label for each image window independently, our model simultaneously predicts a structured labeling of the entire image (Fig.\u00a01). Our model learns statistics that capture the spatial arrangements of various object classes in real images, both in terms of which arrangements to suppress through NMS and which arrangements to favor through spatial co-occurrence statistics.We formulate parameter estimation in our model as a max-margin learning problem. Given training images with ground-truth object locations, we show how to formulate learning as a convex optimization problem. We employ the cutting plane algorithm of Joachims et al. (Mach. Learn.\u00a02009) to efficiently learn a model from thousands of training images. We show state-of-the-art results on the PASCAL VOC benchmark that indicate the benefits of learning a global model encapsulating the spatial layout of multiple object classes (a preliminary version of this work appeared in ICCV 2009, Desai et al., IEEE international conference on computer vision,\u00a02009)."

Rather than focusing on identity assignment, we make inferring attributes the core problem of recognition. These attributes can be semantic (\u201cspotty\u201d) or discriminative (\u201cdogs have it but sheep do not\u201d). Learning attributes presents a major new challenge: generalization across object categories, not just across instances within a category. In this paper, we also introduce a novel feature selection method for learning attributes that generalize well across categories. We support our claims by thorough evaluation that provides insights into the limitations of the standard recognition paradigm of naming and demonstrates the new abilities provided by our attribute-based framework."

In this article, we propose to use as an alternative the Fisher kernel framework. We first show why the Fisher representation is well-suited to the retrieval problem: it describes an image by what makes it different from other images. One drawback of the Fisher vector is that it is high-dimensional and, as opposed to the BOV, it is dense. The resulting memory and computational costs do not make Fisher vectors directly amenable to large-scale retrieval. Therefore, we compress Fisher vectors to reduce their memory footprint and speed-up the retrieval. We compare three binarization approaches: a simple approach devised for this representation and two standard compression techniques. We show on two publicly available datasets that compressed Fisher vectors perform very well using as little as a few hundreds of bits per image, and significantly better than a very recent compressed BOV approach."

This situation has hardly been studied in computer vision research, even though it occurs frequently; the world contains tens of thousands of different object classes, and image collections have been formed and suitably annotated for only a few of them. To tackle the problem, we introduce attribute-based classification: Objects are identified based on a high-level description that is phrased in terms of semantic attributes, such as the object's color or shape. Because the identification of each such property transcends the specific learning task at hand, the attribute classifiers can be prelearned independently, for example, from existing image data sets unrelated to the current task. Afterward, new classes can be detected based on their attribute representation, without the need for a new training phase. In this paper, we also introduce a new data set, Animals with Attributes, of over 30,000 images of 50 animal classes, annotated with 85 semantic attributes. Extensive experiments on this and two more data sets show that attribute-based classification indeed is able to categorize images without access to any training images of the target classes."

In text-to3D scene generation, a user provides as input natural language text from which we extract explicit constraints on the objects that should appear in the scene. The main innovation of this work is to show how to augment these explicit constraints with learned spatial knowledge to infer missing objects and likely layouts for the objects in the scene.

However, the sentence vectors of previous models cannot accurately represent visually grounded meaning. We introduce the DT-RNN model which uses dependency trees to embed sentences into a vector space in order to retrieve images that are described by those sentences. Unlike previous RNN-based models which use constituency trees, DT-RNNs naturally focus on the action and agents in a sentence. They are better able to abstract from the details of word order and syntactic expression. DT-RNNs outperform other recursive and recurrent neural networks, kernelized CCA and a bag-of-words baseline on the tasks of finding an image that fits a sentence description and vice versa. They also give more similar representations to sentences that describe the same image."

For example, given an image, LSP can map the statement \u201cblue mug on the table\u201d to the set of image segments showing blue mugs on tables. LSP learns physical representations for both categorical (\u201cblue,\u201d \u201cmug\u201d) and relational (\u201con\u201d) language, and also learns to compose these representations to produce the referents of entire statements. We further introduce a weakly supervised training procedure that estimates LSP\u2019s parameters using annotated referents for entire statements, without annotated referents for individual words or the parse structure of the statement. We perform experiments on two applications: scene understanding and geographical question answering. We find that LSP outperforms existing, less expressive models that cannot represent relational language. We further find that weakly supervised training is competitive with fully supervised training while requiring significantly less annotation effort."

We first present and evaluate different ways of aggregating local image descriptors into a vector and show that the Fisher kernel achieves better performance than the reference bag-of-visual words approach for any given vector dimension. We then jointly optimize dimensionality reduction and indexing in order to obtain a precise vector comparison as well as a compact representation. The evaluation shows that the image representation can be reduced to a few dozen bytes while preserving high accuracy. Searching a 100 million image data set takes about 250 ms on one processor core."

For systems based on local features we show how to get both efficient geometric verification of every match and unprecedented speed for the low sparsity situation. \n \nLarge-scale systems based on quantized local features usually process the index one term at a time, forcing two separate scoring steps: First, a scoring step to find candidates with enough matches, and then a geometric verification step where a subset of the candidates are checked. \n \nOur method searches through the index a document at a time, verifying the geometry of every candidate in a single pass. We study the behavior of several algorithms with respect to index density--a key element for large-scale databases. In order to further improve the efficiency we also introduce a new new data structure, called the counting min-tree, which outperforms other approaches when working with low database density, a necessary condition for very large-scale systems. \n \nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a proof of concept system that can match an image against a database of more than 90 billion images in just a few seconds."

In order to scale the use of these describable visual attributes to a large number of categories, especially those not well studied by psychologists or linguists, it will be necessary to find alternative techniques for identifying attribute vocabularies and for learning to recognize attributes without hand labeled training data. We demonstrate that it is possible to accomplish both these tasks automatically by mining text and image data sampled from the Internet. The proposed approach also characterizes attributes according to their visual representation: global or local, and type: color, texture, or shape. This work focuses on discovering attributes and their visual appearance, and is as agnostic as possible about the textual description."

In particular, we address novel-category recognition: the task of defining indexing structures and image representations which enable a large collection of images to be searched for an object category that was not known when the index was built. Instead, the training images defining the category are supplied at query time. We explicitly learn descriptors of a given length (from as small as 16 bytes per image) which have good object-recognition performance. In contrast to previous work in the domain of object recognition, we do not choose an arbitrary intermediate representation, but explicitly learn short codes. In contrast to previous approaches to learn compact codes, we optimize explicitly for (an upper bound on) classification performance. Optimization directly for binary features is difficult and nonconvex, but we present an alternation scheme and convex upper bound which demonstrate excellent performance in practice. PICODES of 256 bytes match the accuracy of the current best known classifier for the Caltech256 benchmark, but they decrease the database storage size by a factor of 100 and speed-up the training and testing of novel classes by orders of magnitude."

We introduce a new dataset that provides annotation for sharing models of appearance and correlation across categories. We use it to learn part and category detectors. These serve as the visual basis for an integrated model of objects. We describe objects by the spatial arrangement of their attributes and the interactions between them. Using this model, our system can find animals and vehicles that it has not seen and infer attributes, such as function and pose. Our experiments demonstrate that we can more reliably locate and describe both familiar and unfamiliar objects, compared to a baseline that relies purely on basic category detectors."

The dataset contains a total of 100 million media objects, of which approximately 99.2 million are photos and 0.8 million are videos, all of which carry a Creative Commons license. Each media object in the dataset is represented by several pieces of metadata, e.g. Flickr identifier, owner name, camera, title, tags, geo, media source. The collection provides a comprehensive snapshot of how photos and videos were taken, described, and shared over the years, from the inception of Flickr in 2004 until early 2014. In this article we explain the rationale behind its creation, as well as the implications the dataset has for science, research, engineering, and development. We further present several new challenges in multimedia research that can now be expanded upon with our dataset."

Our main contribution is COSTA, which exploits co-occurrences of visual concepts in images for knowledge transfer. These inter-dependencies arise naturally between concepts, and are easy to obtain from existing annotations or web-search hit counts. We estimate a classifier for a new label, as a weighted combination of related classes, using the co-occurrences to define the weight. We propose various metrics to leverage these co-occurrences, and a regression model for learning a weight for each related class. We also show that our zero-shot classifiers can serve as priors for few-shot learning. Experiments on three multi-labeled datasets reveal that our proposed zero-shot methods, are approaching and occasionally outperforming fully supervised SVMs. We conclude that co-occurrence statistics suffice for zero-shot classification."

Most approaches use co-occurrence of \"nouns\" and image features over large datasets to determine the correspondence, but many correspondence ambiguities remain. We further constrain the correspondence problem by exploiting additional language constructs to improve the learning process from weakly labeled data. We consider both \"prepositions\" and \"comparative adjectives\" which are used to express relationships between objects. If the models of such relationships can be determined, they help resolve correspondence ambiguities. However, learning models of these relationships requires solving the correspondence problem. We simultaneously learn the visual features defining \"nouns\" and the differential visual features defining such \"binary-relationships\" using an EM-based approach."

In this paper, we study strategies to crowd-source bounding box annotations. The core challenge of building such a system is to effectively control the data quality with minimal cost. Our key observation is that drawing a bounding box is significantly more difficult and time consuming than giving answers to multiple choice questions. Thus quality control through additional verification tasks is more cost effective than consensus based algorithms. In particular, we present a system that consists of three simple sub-tasks \u2014 a drawing task, a quality verification task and a coverage verification task. Experimental results demonstrate that our system is scalable, accurate, and cost-effective."

While it is encouraging to see its potential being tapped, it brings forth a fundamental challenge to the vision researcher: scalability. How can we learn a model for any concept that exhaustively covers all its appearance variations, while requiring minimal or no human supervision for compiling the vocabulary of visual variance, gathering the training images and annotations, and learning the models? In this paper, we introduce a fully-automated approach for learning extensive models for a wide range of variations (e.g. actions, interactions, attributes and beyond) within any concept. Our approach leverages vast resources of online books to discover the vocabulary of variance, and intertwines the data collection and modeling steps to alleviate the need for explicit human supervision in training the models. Our approach organizes the visual knowledge about a concept in a convenient and useful way, enabling a variety of applications across vision and NLP. Our online system has been queried by users to learn models for several interesting concepts including breakfast, Gandhi, beautiful, etc. To date, our system has models available for over 50, 000 variations within 150 concepts, and has annotated more than 10 million images with bounding boxes."

We review the state-of-the-art in evaluated methods for both classification and detection, analyse whether the methods are statistically different, what they are learning from the images (e.g. the object or its context), and what the methods find easy or confuse. The paper concludes with lessons learnt in the three year history of the challenge, and proposes directions for future improvement and extension."

The challenge has been run annually from 2010 to present, attracting participation from more than fifty institutions. This paper describes the creation of this benchmark dataset and the advances in object recognition that have been possible as a result. We discuss the challenges of collecting large-scale ground truth annotation, highlight key breakthroughs in categorical object recognition, provide a detailed analysis of the current state of the field of large-scale image classification and object detection, and compare the state-of-the-art computer vision accuracy with human accuracy. We conclude with lessons learned in the 5\u00a0years of the challenge, and propose future directions and improvements."

The potential benefit from this source is made more significant due to the enormous amount of language data easily available today. We present a system to automatically generate natural language descriptions from images that exploits both statistics gleaned from parsing large quantities of text data and recognition algorithms from computer vision. The system is very effective at producing relevant sentences for images. It also generates descriptions that are notably more true to the specific image content than previous work."

The idea is to decompose the space into a Cartesian product of low-dimensional subspaces and to quantize each subspace separately. A vector is represented by a short code composed of its subspace quantization indices. The euclidean distance between two vectors can be efficiently estimated from their codes. An asymmetric version increases precision, as it computes the approximate distance between a vector and a code. Experimental results show that our approach searches for nearest neighbors efficiently, in particular in combination with an inverted file system. Results for SIFT and GIST image descriptors show excellent search accuracy, outperforming three state-of-the-art approaches. The scalability of our approach is validated on a data set of two billion vectors."

Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states.

Perhaps one of the main reasons for this is the lack of demanding benchmarks that mimic such scenarios. In this paper, we take advantage of our autonomous driving platform to develop novel challenging benchmarks for the tasks of stereo, optical flow, visual odometry/SLAM and 3D object detection. Our recording platform is equipped with four high resolution video cameras, a Velodyne laser scanner and a state-of-the-art localization system. Our benchmarks comprise 389 stereo and optical flow image pairs, stereo visual odometry sequences of 39.2 km length, and more than 200k 3D object annotations captured in cluttered scenarios (up to 15 cars and 30 pedestrians are visible per image). Results from state-of-the-art algorithms reveal that methods ranking high on established datasets such as Middlebury perform below average when being moved outside the laboratory to the real world. Our goal is to reduce this bias by providing challenging benchmarks with novel difficulties to the computer vision community. Our benchmarks are available online at: www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti."

By leveraging syntactically informed word co-occurrence statistics, the generator filters and constrains the noisy detections output from a vision system to generate syntactic trees that detail what the computer vision system sees. Results show that the generation system outperforms state-of-the-art systems, automatically generating some of the most natural image descriptions to date."

One is the conventional action classification task where we assign a class label to each action image; the other is a new problem where we measure the similarity between action images. We achieve the goals by using a mutual context model to jointly model the objects and human poses in images of human actions. Experimental results show that our method not only improves action classification accuracy, but also learns a similarity measure that is largely consistent with human perception."

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry."

The framework is a BSD-licensed C++ library with Python and MATLAB bindings for training and deploying general-purpose convolutional neural networks and other deep models efficiently on commodity architectures. Caffe fits industry and internet-scale media needs by CUDA GPU computation, processing over 40 million images a day on a single K40 or Titan GPU (approx 2 ms per image). By separating model representation from actual implementation, Caffe allows experimentation and seamless switching among platforms for ease of development and deployment from prototyping machines to cloud environments. Caffe is maintained and developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC) with the help of an active community of contributors on GitHub. It powers ongoing research projects, large-scale industrial applications, and startup prototypes in vision, speech, and multimedia."

                "text": "Most coreference resolution models determine if two mentions are coreferent using a single function over a set of constraints or features. This approach can lead to incorrect decisions as lower precision features often overwhelm the smaller number of high precision ones. To overcome this problem, we propose a simple coreference architecture based on a sieve that applies tiers of deterministic coreference models one at a time from highest to lowest precision. Each tier builds on the previous tier's entity cluster output. Further, our model propagates global information by sharing attributes (e.g., gender and number) across mentions in the same cluster. This cautious sieve guarantees that stronger features are given precedence over weaker ones and that each decision is made using all of the information available at the time. The framework is highly modular: new coreference modules can be plugged in without any change to the other modules. In spite of its simplicity, our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised models on several standard corpora. This suggests that sieve-based approaches could be applied to other NLP tasks."

No restrictions are imposed on the factor graph to allow for higher-order factors and arbitrary neighborhood structures. Large models with repetitive structure are handled efficiently because (i) functions that occur repeatedly need to be stored only once, and (ii) distinct functions can be implemented differently, using different encodings alongside each other in the same model. Several parametric functions (e.g. metrics), sparse and dense value tables are provided and so is an interface for custom C++ code. Algorithms are separated by design from the representation of graphical models and are easily exchangeable. OpenGM, its algorithms, HDF5 file format and command line tools are modular and extendible."
