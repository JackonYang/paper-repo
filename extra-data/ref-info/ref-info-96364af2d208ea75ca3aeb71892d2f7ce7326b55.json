In contrast to the well known back-off n-gram language models, the neural network approach attempts to overcome the data sparseness problem by performing the estimation in a continuous space. This type of language model was mostly used for tasks for which only a very limited amount of in-domain training data is available.In this paper we present new algorithms to train a neural network language model on very large text corpora. This makes possible the use of the approach in domains where several hundreds of millions words of texts are available. The neural network language model is evaluated in a state-of-the-art real-time continuous speech recognizer for French Broadcast News. Word error reductions of 0.5% absolute are reported using only a very limited amount of additional processing time."

Speech recognition experiments show around 18% reduction of word error rate on the Wall Street Journal task when comparing models trained on the same amount of data, and around 5% on the much harder NIST RT05 task, even when the backoff model is trained on much more data than the RNN LM.

The main advantage of these architectures is that they learn an embedding for words (or other symbols) in a continuous space that helps to smooth the language model and provide good generalization even when the number of training examples is insufficient. However, these models are extremely slow in comparison to the more commonly used n-gram models, both for training and recognition. As an alternative to an importance sampling method proposed to speed-up training, we introduce a hierarchical decomposition of the conditional probabilities that yields a speed-up of about 200 both during training and recognition. The hierarchical decomposition is a binary hierarchical clustering constrained by the prior knowledge extracted from the WordNet semantic hierarchy."

This model is able to handle vocabularies of arbitrary size, hence dispensing with the design of short-lists that are commonly used in NNLMs. Several softmax layers replace the standard output layer in this model. The output structure depends on the word clustering which uses the continuous word representation induced by a NNLM. The GALE Mandarin data was used to carry out the speech-to-text experiments and evaluate the NNLMs. On this data the well tuned baseline system has a character error rate under 10%. Our model achieves consistent improvements over the combination of an n-gram model and classical short-list NNLMs both in terms of perplexity and recognition accuracy."

The neural network model is better suited to tackle the data sparseness problem and its use gave significant improvements in perplexity and word error rate over the baseline SLM.

The neural probabilistic model makes use of a distributed representation of the items in the conditioning history, and is powerful in capturing long dependencies. Employing neural network based models in the syntactic based language model enables it to use efficiently the large amount of information available in a syntactic parse in estimating the next word in a string. Several scenarios of integrating neural networks in the syntactic based language model are presented, accompanied by the derivation of the training procedures involved. Experiments on the UPenn Treebank and the Wall Street Journal corpus show significant improvements in perplexity and word error rate over the baseline SLM. Furthermore, comparisons with the standard and neural net based N-gram models with arbitrarily long contexts show that the syntactic information is in fact very helpful in estimating the word string probability. Overall, our neural syntactic based model achieves the best published results in perplexity and WER for the given data sets."

In statistical language modeling, large amounts of text are used to automatically determine the model's parameters. Language modeling is useful in automatic speech recognition, machine translation, and any other application that processes natural language with incomplete knowledge. In this thesis, I view language as an information source which emits a stream of symbols from a finite alphabet (the vocabulary). The goal of language modeling is then to identify and exploit sources of information in the language stream, so as to minimize its perceived entropy. Most existing statistical language models exploit the immediate past only. To extract information from further back in the document's history, I use trigger pairs as the basic information bearing elements. This allows the model to adapt its expectations to the topic of discourse. Next, statistical evidence from many sources must be combined. Traditionally, linear interpolation and its variants have been used, but these are shown here to be seriously deficient. Instead, I apply the principle of Maximum Entropy (ME). Each information source gives rise to a set of constraints, to be imposed on the combined estimate. The intersection of these constraints is the set of probability functions which are consistent with all the information sources. The function with the highest entropy within that set is the NE solution. Language modeling, Adaptive language modeling, Statistical language modeling, Maximum entropy, Speech recognition."

                "text": "A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts."

The resulting static trigram language model (STLM) has fixed probabilities that are independent of the document being dictated. To improve the language model (LM), one can adapt the probabilities of the trigram language model to match the current document more closely. The partially dictated document provides significant clues about what words are more likely to be used next. Of many methods that can be used to adapt the LM, we describe in this paper a simple model based on the trigram frequencies estimated from the partially dictated document. We call this model a cache trigram language model (CTLM) since we are caching the recent history of words. We have found that the CTLM reduces the perplexity of a dictated document by 23%. The error rate of a 20,000-word isolated word recognizer decreases by about 5% at the beginning of a document and by about 24% after a few hundred words."

The main drawback of NPLMs is their extremely long training and testing times. Morin and Bengio have proposed a hierarchical language model built around a binary tree of words, which was two orders of magnitude faster than the non-hierarchical model it was based on. However, it performed considerably worse than its non-hierarchical counterpart in spite of using a word tree created using expert knowledge. We introduce a fast hierarchical language model along with a simple feature-based algorithm for automatic construction of word trees from the data. We then show that the resulting models can outperform non-hierarchical neural models as well as the best n-gram models."

Unlike traditional discriminative training methods that require transcribed speech, only untranscribed speech and a large text corpus is required. An exponential form is assumed for the language model, as done in maximum entropy estimation, but the model is trained from the text using a discriminative criterion that targets word confusions actually witnessed in first-pass ASR output lattices. Specifically, model parameters are estimated to maximize the likelihood ratio between words w in the text corpus and w's cohorts in the test speech, i.e. other words that w competes with in the test lattices. Empirical results are presented to demonstrate statistically significant improvements over a 4-gram language model on a large vocabulary ASR task."

We propose three new probabilistic language models that define the distribution of the next word in a sequence given several preceding words by using distributed representations of those words. We show how real-valued distributed representations for words can be learned at the same time as learning a large set of stochastic binary hidden features that are used to predict the distributed representation of the next word from previous distributed representations. Adding connections from the previous states of the binary hidden features improves performance as does adding direct connections between the real-valued distributed representations. One of our models significantly outperforms the very best n-gram models."

Two pass strategies have become popular in a number of recognition tasks such as ASR (automatic speech recognition), MT (machine translation) and OCR (optical character recognition). The first pass typically applies a weak language model (n-grams) to a lattice and the second pass applies a stronger language model to N best lists. The stronger language model is intended to capture more long-distance dependencies. The proposed method uses RNN-LM (recurrent neural network language model), which is a long span LM, to re-score word lattices in the second pass. A hill climbing method (iterative decoding) is proposed to search over islands of confusability in the word lattice. An evaluation based on Broadcast News shows speedups of 20 over basic N best re-scoring, and word error rate reduction of 8% (relative) on a highly competitive setup."

Instead, an N-best list of hypotheses is created using tractable n-gram models, and rescored using the long-span models. It is shown in this paper that computationally tractable variational approximations of the long-span models are a better choice than standard n-gram models for first pass decoding. They not only result in a better first pass output, but also produce a lattice with a lower oracle word error rate, and rescoring the N-best list from such lattices with the long-span models requires a smaller N to attain the same accuracy. Empirical results on the WSJ, MIT Lectures, NIST 2007 Meeting Recognition and NIST 2001 Conversational Telephone Recognition data sets are presented to support these claims."

Fortunately, recent advances in Hessian-free optimization have been able to overcome the difficulties associated with training RNNs, making it possible to apply them successfully to challenging sequence problems. In this paper we demonstrate the power of RNNs trained with the new Hessian-Free optimizer (HF) by applying them to character-level language modeling tasks. The standard RNN architecture, while effective, is not ideally suited for such tasks, so we introduce a new RNN variant that uses multiplicative (or \"gated\") connections which allow the current input character to determine the transition matrix from one hidden state vector to the next. After training the multiplicative RNN with the HF optimizer for five days on 8 high-end Graphics Processing Units, we were able to surpass the performance of the best previous single method for character-level language modeling \u2013 a hierarchical non-parametric sequence model. To our knowledge this represents the largest recurrent neural network application to date."

While much effort in language modeling research has been directed at designing better models or smoothing techniques for n-gram language models, in this paper we take the approach of augmenting the context in the n-gram model with different sources of information. We start by adding word class labels to the context. The word classes are automatically derived from un-annotated training data. As a contrast, we also experiment with POS tags which require a tagger trained on annotated data. An amalgam of these two methods uses class labels defined on word and POS tag combinations. Other context features include super-tags derived from the syntactic tree structure as well as semantic features derived from PropBank. Experiments on the DARPA GALE Arabic speech recognition task show that augmented context features often improve both perplexity and word error rate."

The advantage of the proposed method comes from a more robust and efficient subsampling technique. The original multi-class language modeling problem is transformed into a set of binary problems where each binary classifier predicts whether or not a particular word will occur. We show that the binarized model is as powerful as the standard model and allows us to aggressively subsample negative training examples without sacrificing predictive performance. Empirical results show that we can train MELM and NNLM at 1% ~ 5% of the standard complexity with no loss in performance."

However, training the neural network model with the maximum-likelihood criterion requires computations proportional to the number of words in the vocabulary. In this paper, we introduce adaptive importance sampling as a way to accelerate training of the model. The idea is to use an adaptive n-gram model to track the conditional distributions produced by the neural network. We show that a very significant speedup can be obtained on standard problems."

We present a technique that represents a back-off n-gram language model using arrays of integer values and thus renders it amenable to effective block compression. We propose a few such compression algorithms and evaluate the resulting language model along two dimensions: memory footprint, and speed reduction relative to the uncompressed one. We experimented with a model that uses a 32-bit word vocabulary (at most 4B words) and log-probabilities/back-off-weights quantized to 1 byte, respectively. The best compression algorithm achieves 2.6 bytes/n-gram at \u224818X slower than uncompressed. For faster LM operation we found it feasible to represent the LM at \u22484.0 bytes/n-gram, and \u22483X slower than the uncompressed LM. The memory footprint of a LM containing one billion ngrams can thus be reduced to 3-4 Gbytes without impacting its speed too much."

The idea is to derive a language model from the combination of a set of random class-based models. Each of the constituent random class-based models is built using a separate clustering obtained via a different run of a randomized clustering algorithm. The random class-based model can compensate for some of the shortcomings of conventional class-based models by combining the different solutions obtained through random clusterings. Experimental results show that the combined random class-based model improves considerably in perplexity (PPL) and word error rate (WER) over both the n-gram and baseline class-based models."

In this work, we show how this relationship can be used to motivate two heuristics for \"shrinking\" the size of a language model to improve its performance. We use the first heuristic to develop a novel class-based language model that outperforms a baseline word trigram model by 28% in perplexity and 1.9% absolute in speech recognition word-error rate on Wall Street Journal data. We use the second heuristic to motivate a regularized version of minimum discrimination information models and show that this method outperforms other techniques for domain adaptation."

To extract information from the document history, trigger pairs are used as the basic information-bearing elements. To combine statistical evidence from multiple triggers, the principle of maximum entropy (ME) is used. To combine the trigger-based model with the static model, the latter is absorbed into the ME formalism. Given consistent statistical evidence, a unique ME solution is guaranteed to exist, and an iterative algorithm exists which is guaranteed to converge to it. Among the advantages of this approach are its simplicity, generality, and incremental nature. Among its disadvantages are its computational requirements. The model described here was trained on five million words of Wall Street Journal text. It used some 40000 unigram constraints, 200000 bigram constraints, 200000 trigram constraints, and 60000 trigger constraints. After 13 iterations, it produced a language model whose perplexity was 12% lower than that of a conventional trigram, as measured on independent data.<<ETX>>"

Lexical features and syntactic constraints are tightly integrated into a uniform linguistic structure called a SuperARV that is associated with a word in the lexicon. The SuperARV language model reduces perplexity and word error rate compared to trigram, part-of-speech-based, and parser-based language models. The relative contributions of the various knowledge sources to the strength of our model are also investigated by using constraint relaxation at the level of the knowledge sources. We have found that although each knowledge source contributes to language model quality, lexical features are an outstanding contributor when they are tightly integrated with word identity and syntactic constraints. Our investigation also suggests possible reasons for the reported poor performance of several probabilistic dependency grammar models in the literature."

Unfortunately, long training times make maximum entropy research difficult. We present a speedup technique: we change the form of the model to use classes. Our speedup works by creating two maximum entropy models, the first of which predicts the class of each word, and the second of which predicts the word itself. This factoring of the model leads to fewer nonzero indicator functions, and faster normalization, achieving speedups of up to a factor of 35 over one of the best previous techniques. It also results in typically slightly lower perplexities. The same trick can be used to speed training of other machine learning techniques, e.g. neural networks, applied to any problem with a large number of outputs, such as language modeling."

It is shown that the relative entropy resulting from pruning a single N-gram can be computed exactly and efficiently for backoff models. The relative entropy measure can be expressed as a relative change in training set perplexity. This leads to a simple pruning criterion whereby all N-grams that change perplexity by less than a threshold are removed from the model. Experiments show that a production-quality Hub4 LM can be reduced to 26% its original size without increasing recognition error. We also compare the approach to a heuristic pruning criterion by Seymore and Rosenfeld (1996), and show that their approach can be interpreted as an approximation to the relative entropy criterion. Experimentally, both approaches select similar sets of N-grams (about 85% overlap), with the exact relative entropy criterion giving marginally better performance."

Traditionally, re-scoring has been carried out by the N-best list method or by the lattices or confusion network dynamic programming method. Although the dynamic programming method is optimal, it allows for the incorporation of only Markov knowledge sources. N-best lists, on the other hand, can incorporate sentence level knowledge sources, but with increasing N, the re-scoring becomes computationally very intensive. In this paper, we present an elegant framework for confusion network re-scoring called \u2018Iterative Decoding\u2019. In it, integration of multiple and complex knowledge sources is not only easier but it also allows for much faster re-scoring as compared to the N-best list method. Experiments with Language Model re-scoring show that for comparable performance (in terms of word error rate (WER)) of Iterative Decoding and N-best list re-scoring, the search effort required by our method is 22 times less than that of the N-best list method."

While they work quite well for the types of problems for which they have been designed, they do not use recursion at all and this severely limits their power. Among techniques employing recursion, Recurrent Neural Nets, Context Free Grammar Discovery, Genetic Algorithms, and Genetic Programming have been prominent. I will describe the Universal Distribution, a method of induction that is guaranteed to discover any describable regularities in a body of data, using a relatively small sample of the data. While the incomputability of this distribution has sharply limited its adoption by the machine learning community, I will show that paradoxically, this incomputability imposes no limitation at all on its application to practical prediction. My recent work has centered mainly on two systems for machine learning. The first might be called \u201dThe Baby Machine\u201d We start out with the machine having little problem specific knowledge, but a very good learning algorithm. At first we give it very simple problems. It uses its solutions to these problems to devise a probability distribution over function space to help search for solutions to harder problems. We give it harder problems and it updates its probability distribution on their solutions. This continues recursively, solving more and more difficult problems. The task of writing a suitable training sequence has been made much easier by Moore\u2019s Law, which gives us enough computer speed to enable large conceptual jumps between problems in the sequence. \u2217Revision of lecture given at AI@50, The Dartmouth Artificial Intelligence Conference, Dartmouth, N.H.

An empirical comparison with feedforward networks is also provided. In the end, we discuss possibilities how to reduce the amount of parameters in the model. The resulting RNN model can thus be smaller, faster both during training and testing, and more accurate than the basic one."

This work takes a step towards addressing this issue. We present the MSR Sentence Completion Challenge Data, which consists of 1,040 sentences, each of which has four impostor sentences, in which a single (fixed) word in the original sentence has been replaced by an impostor word with similar occurrence statistics. For each sentence the task is then to determine which of the five choices for that word is the correct one. This dataset was constructed from Project Gutenberg data. Seed sentences were selected from five of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s Sherlock Holmes novels, and then imposter words were suggested with the aid of a language model trained on over 500 19th century novels. The language model was used to compute 30 alternative words for a given low frequency word in a sentence, and human judges then picked the 4 best impostor words, based on a set of provided guidelines. Although the data presented here will not be changed, this is still a work in progress, and we plan to add similar datasets based on other sources. This technical report is a living document and will be updated appropriately as new datasets are constructed and new results on existing datasets (for example, using human subjects) are reported."

We show that the RF approach can be successfully implemented for language modeling of an inflectional language. Performance of word-based and morphological DTs and RFs was evaluated on lecture recognition task. We show that while DTs perform worse than conventional trigram language models (LM), RFs of both kind outperform the latter. WER (up to 3.4% relative) and perplexity (10%) reduction over the trigram model can be gained with morphological RFs. Further improvement is obtained after interpolation of DT and RF LMs with the trigram one (up to 15.6% perplexity and 4.8% WER relative reduction). In this paper we also investigate distribution of morphological feature types chosen for splitting data at different levels of DTs."

We present explorations of variations on, or of the limits of, each of these techniques, including showing that sentence mixture models may have more potential. While all of these techniques have been studied separately, they have rarely been studied in combination. We compare a combination of all techniques together to a Katz smoothed trigram model with no count cutoffs. We achieve perplexity reductions between 38 and 50% (1 bit of entropy), depending on training data size, as well as a word error rate reduction of 8.9%. Our perplexity reductions are perhaps the highest reported compared to a fair baseline."

The skip trigram model is able to cover more predecessor words of the present word compared to the normal trigram while the same memory space is required. The across sentence boundary model uses the word distribution of the previous sentences to calculate the unigram probability which is applied as the emission probability in the word and the class model frameworks. Our experiments on the Penn Treebank [1] show that each of our proposed models and also their combination significantly outperform the baseline for both the word and the class models and their linear interpolation. The linear interpolation of the word and the class models with the proposed skip trigram and across sentence boundary models achieves 118.4 perplexity while the best state-of-the-art language model has a perplexity of 137.2 on the same dataset."

In practice, to avoid this problem, researchers have used domain specific a-priori knowledge to give meaning to the hidden or state variables representing past context. In this paper, we propose to use a more general type of a-priori knowledge, namely that the temporal dependencies are structured hierarchically. This implies that long-term dependencies are represented by variables with a long time scale. This principle is applied to a recurrent network which includes delays and multiple time scales. Experiments confirm the advantages of such structures. A similar approach is proposed for HMMs and IOHMMs."

We demonstrate empirically that to achieve the same reduction in error rate using a better estimated, higher order language model, our technique evaluates fewer utterance-length hypotheses than conventional N-best rescoring by two orders of magnitude.

It deals with two-phase approaches where speech is first processed by speech recognizer, and the search for queries is performed in the output of this recognizer. Standard large vocabulary continuous speech recognizer (LVCSR) with fixed vocabulary is not capable incapability of detecting out-of-vocabulary words (OOV). A hybrid spoken term detection system combining both word and subword parts in one recognition network is proposed. Extensive experiments investigating into different variants of this approach are performed, and the results (in terms of spoken term detection precision, speed, and necessary computing resources) are reported on standard data from NIST STD 2006 evaluation."

Utilizing recent advances in the Hessian-free optimization approach (Martens, 2010), together with a novel damping scheme, we successfully train RNNs on two sets of challenging problems. First, a collection of pathological synthetic datasets which are known to be impossible for standard optimization approaches (due to their extremely long-term dependencies), and second, on three natural and highly complex real-world sequence datasets where we find that our method significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method for training neural sequence models: the Long Short-term Memory approach of Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997). Additionally, we offer a new interpretation of the generalized Gauss-Newton matrix of Schraudolph (2002) which is used within the HF approach of Martens."

A new two-level segmental clustering approach is devised which combines the decision tree based state tying with agglomerative clustering of rare acoustic phonetic events. In addition, a unified maximum likelihood framework for incorporating both phonetic and nonphonetic features in decision tree based state tying is presented. In contrast to other heuristic data separation methods, which often lead to training data depletion, a tagging scheme is used to attach various features of interest and the selection of these features in the decision tree is data driven. Finally, two methods of using multiple-mixture parameterization to improve the quality of the evaluation function in decision tree state tying are described. One method is based on the approach of k-means fitting and the other method is based on a novel use of a local multilevel optimal subtree. Both methods provide more accurate likelihood evaluation in decision tree clustering and are consistent with the structure of the decision tree. Experimental results on Wall Street Journal corpora demonstrate that the proposed approaches lead to a significant improvement in model quality and recognition performance."

Specifically, let L, M, and J be the probability distributions of responses chosen by a human, machine, and human judge respectively to the judge\u2019s questions in the imitation game. The goal of AI is M = L, the machine is indistinguishable from human. But the machine wins (the judge guesses that it is human) when HJ(M) < HJ(L), where HQ(P) \u2261 \u2212\u03a3x P(x) log Q(x) is the cross entropy of Q with respect to P. This happens when J is a poor estimate of L, meaning that the interrogator fails to anticipate the human\u2019s responses, but even in the worst case when J = L, the machine can still win with a suboptimal solution (M \u2260 L) by deterministically favoring the most likely responses over the true distribution. In contrast, optimal compression of a probabilistic language L with unknown distribution (such as English) using an estimated distribution M (an encoding of length \u2212log2 M(x) bits for each string x) is M = L, by the discrete channel capacity theorem (Shannon, 1949). Answering questions in the Turing test (What are roses?) seems to require the same type of real-world knowledge that people use in predicting characters in a stream of natural language text (Roses are ___?), or equivalently, estimating L(x) for compression. Shannon (1951), and Cover and King (1978) established an upper bound of 1.3 bits per character (bpc) for the entropy (information content) of English narrative in a 27character alphabet (A-Z and space) using human prediction tests. No compression program has achieved this. Seven programs, including those top-rated by Gilchrist (1998) and Bell (1998) were used to compress English narrative, Alice in Wonderland (alice30.txt from the Gutenberg press, minus header) and Far from the Madding Crowd by Thomas Hardy (book1 from the Calgary corpus), after reducing both to 27 characters. The best compression was achieved by rkive 1.91b1: 1.86 bpc on alice and 1.94 on book1. Others tested (from worst to best) were compress 4.3d, pkzip 2.04e, gzip 1.2.4, ha 0.98, szip 1.05x, and boa 0.58b. All program options were set for maximum compression. Better compressors \u201clearn\u201d, using prior input to improve compression on subsequent input. szip was the best learner, compressing book1 to about 95% of the size of the two halves compressed separately. The first figure below shows the correlation between compression and learning. Similar results were obtained for alice. It was also found that better compressors make greater use of the syntactic and semantic constraints of English. Lexical,"

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms."

We argue that in order to progress toward this goal, the Machine Learning community must endeavor to discover algorithms that can learn highly complex functions, with minimal need for prior knowledge, and with minimal human intervention. We present mathematical and empirical evidence suggesting that many popular approaches to non-parametric learning, particularly kernel methods, are fundamentally limited in their ability to learn complex high-dimensional functions. Our analysis focuses on two problems. First, kernel machines are shallow architectures, in which one large layer of simple template matchers is followed by a single layer of trainable coefficients. We argue that shallow architectures can be very inefficient in terms of required number of computational elements and examples. Second, we analyze a limitation of kernel machines with a local kernel, linked to the curse of dimensionality, that applies to supervised, unsupervised (manifold learning) and semi-supervised kernel machines. Using empirical results on invariant image recognition tasks, kernel methods are compared with deep architectures, in which lower-level features or concepts are progressively combined into more abstract and higher-level representations. We argue that deep architectures have the potential to generalize in non-local ways, i.e., beyond immediate neighbors, and that this is crucial in order to make progress on the kind of complex tasks required for artificial intelligence."

One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction."

Two approaches based upon a paradigm of incongruence detection between generic and specific recognition systems are introduced. By arguing, that detection of incongruence is a necessity, but does not suffice when having in mind possible follow-up actions, we motivate the preference of one approach over the other. Nevertheless, we show, that a fusion outperforms both single systems. Finally, we propose possible actions after the detection of unexpected words, and conclude with general remarks about what we found to be important when dealing with unexpected words."

Here, we formalize such training strategies in the context of machine learning, and call them \"curriculum learning\". In the context of recent research studying the difficulty of training in the presence of non-convex training criteria (for deep deterministic and stochastic neural networks), we explore curriculum learning in various set-ups. The experiments show that significant improvements in generalization can be achieved. We hypothesize that curriculum learning has both an effect on the speed of convergence of the training process to a minimum and, in the case of non-convex criteria, on the quality of the local minima obtained: curriculum learning can be seen as a particular form of continuation method (a general strategy for global optimization of non-convex functions)."
