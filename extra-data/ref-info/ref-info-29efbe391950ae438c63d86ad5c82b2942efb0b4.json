We show that our method outperforms previous methods that generate descriptions of objects without taking into account other potentially ambiguous objects in the scene. Our model is inspired by recent successes of deep learning methods for image captioning, but while image captioning is difficult to evaluate, our task allows for easy objective evaluation. We also present a new large-scale dataset for referring expressions, based on MSCOCO. We have released the dataset and a toolbox for visualization and evaluation, see https://github.com/ mjhucla/Google_Refexp_toolbox."

Despite an extremely large space of possible expressions, we demonstrate effective learning of a globally normalized log-linear distribution. This learning is enabled by a new, multi-stage approximate inference technique that uses a pruning model to construct only the most likely logical forms. We train and evaluate the approach on a new corpus of references to sets of visual objects. Experiments show the approach is able to learn accurate models, which generate over 87% of the expressions people used. Additionally, on the previously studied special case of single object reference, we show a 35% relative error reduction over previous state of the art."

                "text": "Past work of generating referring expressions mainly utilized attributes of objects and binary relations between objects to distinguish the referent from other objects. However, such an approach does not work well when there is no distinctive attribute among objects. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a method utilizing the perceptual groups of objects and n-ary relations among them. With the proposed method, an expression like \u201cthe leftmost ball in the left cluster of three balls\u201d can be generated. The key is to identify groups of objects that are naturally recognized by humans. We conducted psychological experiments with 42 subjects to collect referring expressions in such situations, and built a generation algorithm based on the results. The evaluation using another 23 subjects showed that the proposed method could effectively generate proper referring expressions."

We use multiple instance learning to train visual detectors for words that commonly occur in captions, including many different parts of speech such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives. The word detector outputs serve as conditional inputs to a maximum-entropy language model. The language model learns from a set of over 400,000 image descriptions to capture the statistics of word usage. We capture global semantics by re-ranking caption candidates using sentence-level features and a deep multimodal similarity model. Our system is state-of-the-art on the official Microsoft COCO benchmark, producing a BLEU-4 score of 29.1%. When human judges compare the system captions to ones written by other people on our held-out test set, the system captions have equal or better quality 34% of the time."

Few datasets provide the ground truth spatial localization of phrases, thus it is desirable to learn from data with no or little grounding supervision. We propose a novel approach which learns grounding by reconstructing a given phrase using an attention mechanism, which can be either latent or optimized directly. During training our approach encodes the phrase using a recurrent network language model and then learns to attend to the relevant image region in order to reconstruct the input phrase. At test time, the correct attention, i.e., the grounding, is evaluated. If grounding supervision is available it can be directly applied via a loss over the attention mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the Flickr 30k Entities and ReferItGame datasets with different levels of supervision, ranging from no supervision over partial supervision to full supervision. Our supervised variant improves by a large margin over the state-of-the-art on both datasets."

However, the sentence vectors of previous models cannot accurately represent visually grounded meaning. We introduce the DT-RNN model which uses dependency trees to embed sentences into a vector space in order to retrieve images that are described by those sentences. Unlike previous RNN-based models which use constituency trees, DT-RNNs naturally focus on the action and agents in a sentence. They are better able to abstract from the details of word order and syntactic expression. DT-RNNs outperform other recursive and recurrent neural networks, kernelized CCA and a bag-of-words baseline on the tasks of finding an image that fits a sentence description and vice versa. They also give more similar representations to sentences that describe the same image."

In analogy to image search, we propose to frame sentence-based image annotation as the task of ranking a given pool of captions. We introduce a new benchmark collection for sentence-based image description and search, consisting of 8,000 images that are each paired with five different captions which provide clear descriptions of the salient entities and events. We introduce a number of systems that perform quite well on this task, even though they are only based on features that can be obtained with minimal supervision. Our results clearly indicate the importance of training on multiple captions per image, and of capturing syntactic (word order-based) and semantic features of these captions. We also perform an in-depth comparison of human and automatic evaluation metrics for this task, and propose strategies for collecting human judgments cheaply and on a very large scale, allowing us to augment our collection with additional relevance judgments of which captions describe which image. Our analysis shows that metrics that consider the ranked list of results for each query image or sentence are significantly more robust than metrics that are based on a single response per query. Moreover, our study suggests that the evaluation of ranking-based image description systems may be fully automated."

We discuss computational frameworks underlying REG, and demonstrate a recent trend that seeks to link REG algorithms with well-established Knowledge Representation techniques. Considerable attention is given to recent efforts at evaluating REG algorithms and the lessons that they allow us to learn. The article concludes with a discussion of the way forward in REG, focusing on references in larger and more realistic settings."

The first part, content planning, smooths the output of computer vision-based detection and recognition algorithms with statistics mined from large pools of visually descriptive text to determine the best content words to use to describe an image. The second step, surface realization, chooses words to construct natural language sentences based on the predicted content and general statistics from natural language. We present multiple approaches for the surface realization step and evaluate each using automatic measures of similarity to human generated reference descriptions. We also collect forced choice human evaluations between descriptions from the proposed generation system and descriptions from competing approaches. The proposed system is very effective at producing relevant sentences for images. It also generates descriptions that are notably more true to the specific image content than previous work."

We describe how we can train this model in a deterministic manner using standard backpropagation techniques and stochastically by maximizing a variational lower bound. We also show through visualization how the model is able to automatically learn to fix its gaze on salient objects while generating the corresponding words in the output sequence. We validate the use of attention with state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets: Flickr9k, Flickr30k and MS COCO."

Natural language object retrieval differs from text-based image retrieval task as it involves spatial information about objects within the scene and global scene context. To address this issue, we propose a novel Spatial Context Recurrent ConvNet (SCRC) model as scoring function on candidate boxes for object retrieval, integrating spatial configurations and global scene-level contextual information into the network. Our model processes query text, local image descriptors, spatial configurations and global context features through a recurrent network, outputs the probability of the query text conditioned on each candidate box as a score for the box, and can transfer visual-linguistic knowledge from image captioning domain to our task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively utilizes both local and global information, outperforming previous baseline methods significantly on different datasets and scenarios, and can exploit large scale vision and language datasets for knowledge transfer."

In this paper, we present a generative model based on a deep recurrent architecture that combines recent advances in computer vision and machine translation and that can be used to generate natural sentences describing an image. The model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the target description sentence given the training image. Experiments on several datasets show the accuracy of the model and the fluency of the language it learns solely from image descriptions. Our model is often quite accurate, which we verify both qualitatively and quantitatively. For instance, while the current state-of-the-art BLEU-1 score (the higher the better) on the Pascal dataset is 25, our approach yields 59, to be compared to human performance around 69. We also show BLEU-1 score improvements on Flickr30k, from 56 to 66, and on SBU, from 19 to 28. Lastly, on the newly released COCO dataset, we achieve a BLEU-4 of 27.7, which is the current state-of-the-art."

Our pipeline effectively unifies joint image-text embedding models with multimodal neural language models. We introduce the structure-content neural language model that disentangles the structure of a sentence to its content, conditioned on representations produced by the encoder. The encoder allows one to rank images and sentences while the decoder can generate novel descriptions from scratch. Using LSTM to encode sentences, we match the state-of-the-art performance on Flickr8K and Flickr30K without using object detections. We also set new best results when using the 19-layer Oxford convolutional network. Furthermore we show that with linear encoders, the learned embedding space captures multimodal regularities in terms of vector space arithmetic e.g. *image of a blue car* - \"blue\" + \"red\" is near images of red cars. Sample captions generated for 800 images are made available for comparison."

We construct a study designed to elicit naturalistic referring expressions to relatively complex objects, and find aspects of reference that have not been accounted for in work on Referring Expression Generation (REG). This includes reference to object parts, size comparisons without crisp measurements, and the use of analogies. By drawing on research in cognitive science, neurophysiology, and psycholinguistics, we begin developing the input structure and background knowledge necessary for an algorithm capable of generating the kinds of reference we observe."

This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model."

In this paper we present the Inside-Outside Net (ION), an object detector that exploits information both inside and outside the region of interest. Contextual information outside the region of interest is integrated using spatial recurrent neural networks. Inside, we use skip pooling to extract information at multiple scales and levels of abstraction. Through extensive experiments we evaluate the design space and provide readers with an overview of what tricks of the trade are important. ION improves state-of-the-art on PASCAL VOC 2012 object detection from 73.9% to 77.9% mAP. On the new and more challenging MS COCO dataset, we improve state-of-the-art from 19.7% to 33.1% mAP. In the 2015 MS COCO Detection Challenge, our ION model won \"Best Student Entry\" and finished 3rd place overall. As intuition suggests, our detection results provide strong evidence that context and multi-scale representations improve small object detection."

Answering these questions entails discovering the mapping from image A to image B and then extending the mapping to image C and searching for the image D such that the relation from A to B holds for C to D. We pose this problem as learning an embedding that encourages pairs of analogous images with similar transformations to be close together using convolutional neural networks with a quadruple siamese architecture. We introduce a dataset of visual analogy questions in natural images, and show first results of its kind on solving analogy questions on natural images."

Results show that we can achieve a 50% match to human performance as opposed to a 16% baseline for just guessing the most frequent type of nominal expression in the COCONUT corpus.

The dense captioning task generalizes object detection when the descriptions consist of a single word, and Image Captioning when one predicted region covers the full image. To address the localization and description task jointly we propose a Fully Convolutional Localization Network (FCLN) architecture that processes an image with a single, efficient forward pass, requires no external regions proposals, and can be trained end-to-end with a single round of optimization. The architecture is composed of a Convolutional Network, a novel dense localization layer, and Recurrent Neural Network language model that generates the label sequences. We evaluate our network on the Visual Genome dataset, which comprises 94,000 images and 4,100,000 region-grounded captions. We observe both speed and accuracy improvements over baselines based on current state of the art approaches in both generation and retrieval settings."

                "text": "Typicality and Object Reference Margaret Mitchell (m.mitchell@jhu.edu) Human Language Technology Center of Excellence, Johns Hopkins University Baltimore, MD 21211 USA Ehud Reiter (e.reiter@abdn.ac.uk) Kees van Deemter (k.vdeemter@abdn.ac.uk) Computing Science Department, University of Aberdeen Aberdeen, Scotland AB24 3FX UK Abstract Does the typicality of an object affect how we identify it? When we produce initial reference to a visible object, we are influenced by a variety of factors, including what is visually salient (bottom-up influences) as well as our previous experi- ences with the object (top-down influences). In this study, we seek to understand how the top-down influence of typicality affects initial reference to an object. We use real world, every- day objects, and focus on the visual properties of SHAPE and MATERIAL . Our findings suggest that there is a tendency to select the atypical over the typical. But we have only begun to scratch the surface of understanding reference to real world ob- jects. The annotated corpus from this study is made available for future research on modeling reference in visual domains. 1 Keywords: referring expressions; description; reference; vi- sion; typicality (a) A GRE3D3 scene. Figure 1: Example scenes from the GRE3D3 Corpus and the TUNA Furniture sub-corpus. Participants produce refer- ring expressions such as yellow ball on top of the red cube (GRE3D3) or small fan (TUNA). Introduction I never saw a purple cow. I never hope to see one, But I can say this anyhow: I\u2019d rather see than be one. \u2014 Gelett Burgess When we identify an object for a hearer, we have a number of choices to make about what to mention. When the object is visible to both speaker and hearer, properties that help guide visual attention, such as color and size, are particularly infor- mative (Treisman & Gelade, 1980; Wolfe, 2006). Properties that are salient to the discourse or relevant to the speaker and hearer\u2019s previous interactions also affect what we will men- tion and describe (Clark & Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986; Brennan & Clark, 1996; Clark & Krych, 2004). We hypothesize that when we generate initial reference to an object for a hearer, our knowledge about objects of the same type is also likely to affect what we mention. In other words, our understanding of what is typical for an object cat- egory influences the selection of modifiers \u2013 the adjectives and longer descriptive phrases \u2013 that we produce when we first describe an object. This understanding of what is typical for an object category may stem from stored object proto- types (Rosch & Mervis, 1975; Rosch, C. Mervis, W. Gray, Johnson, & Braem, 1976) or mental representations of simi- lar objects in previous situations (Yeh & Barsalou, 2006; Wu & Barsalou, 2009). Because of typicality, we know that the purple cow mentioned in the example above is remarkable. Previous work on reference has paid little attention to the role of typicality. This is equally true for psycholinguistic 1 http://m-mitchell.com/corpora/typicality corpus/ (b) A TUNA scene. work (Arnold, 2008) and for work on computational mod- els of reference (Dale & Reiter, 1995; Krahmer, van Erk, & Verleg, 2003; Krahmer & van Deemter, 2012). The present study addresses what we believe to be a significant gap in our understanding of reference. We examine the role of typicality in reference to real world, everyday objects, focusing on material and shape properties. Objects are presented so that one of these two properties will distinguish the object. We test whether there is a sig- nificant difference between groups when participants in one may choose between atypical shape or typical material to describe target objects, while participants in a second group may choose between typical shape or atypical material to de- scribe target objects. Our findings suggest that there is a ten- dency to select the atypical over the typical. Although this study focuses on shape and material typical- ity, we release the full corpus from our experiments, anno- tated with a variety of visual properties, in hopes of helping further work in constructing models of reference to real ob- jects. Current available corpora for reference to visible ob- jects, such as the GRE3D3 Corpus (Viethen & Dale, 2008) or the TUNA Corpus (van Deemter, Gatt, van der Sluis, & Power, 2012), were built from reference elicited to graphics of simple objects presented on a computer screen (see Figure 1). In this work, we seek to better understand the rich details of reference in real world visual domains, where a multitude of different visual properties interact. This opens up several aspects of reference that have not been researched before and gives rise to further questions about the factors influencing initial reference and visual object descriptions. We discuss some of these issues, and their implications for a computa-"

For this purpose, we annotate semantic parts for all 20 object categories on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, which provides information on object pose, occlusion, viewpoint and functionality. DeePM is a latent graphical model based on the state-of-the-art R-CNN framework, which learns an explicit representation of the object-part configuration with flexible type sharing (e.g., a sideview horse head can be shared by a fully-visible sideview horse and a highly truncated sideview horse with head and neck only). For comparison, we also present an end-to-end Object-Part (OP) R-CNN which learns an implicit feature representation for jointly mapping an image ROI to the object and part bounding boxes. We evaluate the proposed methods for both the object and part detection performance on PASCAL VOC 2012, and show that DeePM consistently outperforms OP R-CNN in detecting objects and parts. In addition, it obtains superior performance to Fast and Faster R-CNNs in object detection."

The system answers questions, executes commands, and accepts information in an interactive English dialog. It is based on the belief that in modeling language understanding, we must deal in an integrated way with all of the aspects of language\u2014syntax, semantics, and inference. The system contains a parser, a recognition grammar of English, programs for semantic analysis, and a general problem solving system. We assume that a computer cannot deal reasonably with language unless it can understand the subject it is discussing. Therefore, the program is given a detailed model of a particular domain. In addition, the system has a simple model of its own mentality. It can remember and discuss its plans and actions as well as carrying them out. It enters into a dialog with a person, responding to English sentences with actions and English replies, asking for clarification when its heuristic programs cannot understand a sentence through the use of syntactic, semantic, contextual, and physical knowledge. Knowledge in the system is represented in the form of procedures, rather than tables of rules or lists of patterns. By developing special procedural representations for syntax, semantics, and inference, we gain flexibility and power. Since each piece of knowledge can be a procedure, it can call directly on any other piece of knowledge in the system."

It directly models the probability distribution of generating a word given previous words and an image. Image captions are generated by sampling from this distribution. The model consists of two sub-networks: a deep recurrent neural network for sentences and a deep convolutional network for images. These two sub-networks interact with each other in a multimodal layer to form the whole m-RNN model. The effectiveness of our model is validated on four benchmark datasets (IAPR TC-12, Flickr 8K, Flickr 30K and MS COCO). Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we apply the m-RNN model to retrieval tasks for retrieving images or sentences, and achieves significant performance improvement over the state-of-the-art methods which directly optimize the ranking objective function for retrieval.

We develop a novel recurrent convolutional architecture suitable for large-scale visual learning which is end-to-end trainable, and demonstrate the value of these models on benchmark video recognition tasks, image description and retrieval problems, and video narration challenges. In contrast to current models which assume a fixed spatio-temporal receptive field or simple temporal averaging for sequential processing, recurrent convolutional models are \u201cdoubly deep\u201d in that they can be compositional in spatial and temporal \u201clayers\u201d. Such models may have advantages when target concepts are complex and/or training data are limited. Learning long-term dependencies is possible when nonlinearities are incorporated into the network state updates. Long-term RNN models are appealing in that they directly can map variable-length inputs (e.g., video frames) to variable length outputs (e.g., natural language text) and can model complex temporal dynamics; yet they can be optimized with backpropagation. Our recurrent long-term models are directly connected to modern visual convnet models and can be jointly trained to simultaneously learn temporal dynamics and convolutional perceptual representations. Our results show such models have distinct advantages over state-of-the-art models for recognition or generation which are separately defined and/or optimized."

One contribution is our technique for the automatic collection of this new dataset \u2013 performing a huge number of Flickr queries and then filtering the noisy results down to 1 million images with associated visually relevant captions. Such a collection allows us to approach the extremely challenging problem of description generation using relatively simple non-parametric methods and produces surprisingly effective results. We also develop methods incorporating many state of the art, but fairly noisy, estimates of image content to produce even more pleasing results. Finally we introduce a new objective performance measure for image captioning."

                "text": "We present a method for detecting objects in images using a single deep neural network. Our approach, named SSD, discretizes the output space of bounding boxes into a set of default boxes over different aspect ratios and scales per feature map location. At prediction time, the network generates scores for the presence of each object category in each default box and produces adjustments to the box to better match the object shape. Additionally, the network combines predictions from multiple feature maps with different resolutions to naturally handle objects of various sizes. Our SSD model is simple relative to methods that require object proposals because it completely eliminates proposal generation and subsequent pixel or feature resampling stage and encapsulates all computation in a single network. This makes SSD easy to train and straightforward to integrate into systems that require a detection component. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and ILSVRC datasets confirm that SSD has comparable accuracy to methods that utilize an additional object proposal step and is much faster, while providing a unified framework for both training and inference. Compared to other single stage methods, SSD has much better accuracy, even with a smaller input image size. For $300\\times 300$ input, SSD achieves 72.1% mAP on VOC2007 test at 58 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X and for $500\\times 500$ input, SSD achieves 75.1% mAP, outperforming a comparable state of the art Faster R-CNN model.

These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision."

The winning model on the localization sub-task was a network that predicts a single bounding box and a confidence score for each object category in the image. Such a model captures the whole-image context around the objects but cannot handle multiple instances of the same object in the image without naively replicating the number of outputs for each instance. In this work, we propose a saliency-inspired neural network model for detection, which predicts a set of class-agnostic bounding boxes along with a single score for each box, corresponding to its likelihood of containing any object of interest. The model naturally handles a variable number of instances for each class and allows for cross-class generalization at the highest levels of the network. We are able to obtain competitive recognition performance on VOC2007 and ILSVRC2012, while using only the top few predicted locations in each image and a small number of neural network evaluations."

Advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015 competitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks. Code has been made publicly available"

We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8\u00d7 deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC & COCO 2015 competitions1, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation."

                "text": "Several variants of the long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture for recurrent neural networks have been proposed since its inception in 1995. In recent years, these networks have become the state-of-the-art models for a variety of machine learning problems. This has led to a renewed interest in understanding the role and utility of various computational components of typical LSTM variants. In this paper, we present the first large-scale analysis of eight LSTM variants on three representative tasks: speech recognition, handwriting recognition, and polyphonic music modeling. The hyperparameters of all LSTM variants for each task were optimized separately using random search, and their importance was assessed using the powerful functional ANalysis Of VAriance framework. In total, we summarize the results of 5400 experimental runs ( $\\approx 15$  years of CPU time), which makes our study the largest of its kind on LSTM networks. Our results show that none of the variants can improve upon the standard LSTM architecture significantly, and demonstrate the forget gate and the output activation function to be its most critical components. We further observe that the studied hyperparameters are virtually independent and derive guidelines for their efficient adjustment."

This paper describes the creation of this benchmark dataset and the advances in object recognition that have been possible as a result. We discuss the challenges of collecting large-scale ground truth annotation, highlight key breakthroughs in categorical object recognition, provide a detailed analysis of the current state of the field of large-scale image classification and object detection, and compare the state-of-the-art computer vision accuracy with human accuracy. We conclude with lessons learned in the 5\u00a0years of the challenge, and propose future directions and improvements."

Fast R-CNN trains the very deep VGG16 network 9x faster than R-CNN, is 213x faster at test-time, and achieves a higher mAP on PASCAL VOC 2012. Compared to SPPnet, Fast R-CNN trains VGG16 3x faster, tests 10x faster, and is more accurate.

                "text": "As Grice\u2019s enthusiasm for ordinary language philosophy became increasingly qualified during the 1950s, his interest was growing in the rather different styles of philosophy of language then current in America. Recent improvements in communications had made possible an exchange of ideas across the Atlantic that would have been unthinkable before the war. W. V. O. Quine had made a considerable impression at Oxford during his time as Eastman Professor. Grice was interested in Quine\u2019s logical approach to language, although he differed from him over certain specific questions, such as the viability of the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements. Quine, who was visiting England for a whole year, and who brought with him clothes, books and even provisions in the knowledge that rationing was still in force, travelled by ship.1 However, during the same decade the rapid proliferation of passenger air travel enabled movement of academics between Britain and America for even short stays and lecture tours. Grice himself made a number of such visits, and was impressed by the formal and theory-driven philosophy he encountered. Most of all he was impressed by the work of Noam Chomsky."
