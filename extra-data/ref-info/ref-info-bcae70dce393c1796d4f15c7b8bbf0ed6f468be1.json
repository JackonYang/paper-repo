The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds."

KNN is used to find the matches, and RANSAC to reject inconsistent matches from which the inliers can take as correct matches. The performance of the robust feature detection methods are compared for scale changes, rotation, and blur. All the experiments use repeatability measurement and the number of correct matches for the evaluation measurements. SIFT presents its stability in most situations although it\u201fs slow. SURF is the fastest one with good performance as the same as SIFT. PCA-SIFT show its advantages in rotation and illumination changes."

To this end we develop a number of novel components. First, we introduce a new edge-based local feature detector that is invariant to similarity transformations. The features are localized on edges and a neighbourhood is estimated in a scale invariant manner. Second, the neighbourhood descriptor computed for foreground features is not affected by background clutter, even if the feature is on an object boundary. Third, the descriptor generalizes Lowe's SIFT method to edges. An object model is learnt from a single training image. The object is then recognized in new images in a series of steps which apply progressively tighter geometric restrictions. A final contribution of this work is to allow sufficient flexibility in the geometric representation that objects in the same visual class can be recognized. Results are demonstrated for various object classes including bikes and rackets."

Recent work has shown that scale-space `interest points' may be found with good repeatability in spite of such changes. Further- more, the high entropy of the surrounding image regions means that local descriptors are highly discriminative for matching. For descrip- tors at interest points to be robustly matched between images, they must be as far as possible invariant to the imaging process. In this work we introduce a family of features which use groups of interest points to form geometrically invariant descriptors of image regions. Feature descriptors are formed by resampling the image rel- ative to canonical frames de\u00afned by the points. In addition to robust matching, a key advantage of this approach is that each match implies a hypothesis of the local 2D (projective) transformation. This allows us to immediately reject most of the false matches using a Hough trans- form. We reject remaining outliers using RANSAC and the epipolar constraint. Results show that dense feature matching can be achieved in a few seconds of computation on 1GHz Pentium III machines."

The design of this local feature is motivated by a desire to obtain feature vectors which are semi-invariant under common image deformations, yet distinctive enough to provide useful identity information. A recent proposal for such local features involves combining differential invariants to particular image deformations, such as rotation. Our approach differs in that we consider a wider class of image deformations, including the addition of noise, along with both global and local brightness variations. We use steerable filters to make the feature robust to rotation. And we exploit the fact that phase data is often locally stable with respect to scale changes, noise, and common brightness changes. We provide empirical results comparing our local feature with one based on differential invariants. The results show that our phase-based local feature leads to better performance when dealing with common illumination changes and 2-D rotation, while giving comparable effects in terms of scale changes."

However, it is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest point detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the point detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion detection rate with respect to false positive rate and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare SIFT descriptors (Lowe, 1999), steerable filters (Freeman and Adelson, 1991), differential invariants (Koenderink ad van Doorn, 1987), complex filters (Schaffalitzky and Zisserman, 2002), moment invariants (Van Gool et al., 1996) and cross-correlation for different types of interest points. In this evaluation, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors does not depend on the point detector and that SIFT descriptors perform best. Steerable filters come second ; they can be considered a good choice given the low dimensionality."

In other words, it generates coarse segmentation cues, and can hence be seen as preceding further processing, which can then be properly tuned. It is argued that once such information is available, many other processing tasks can become much simpler. Experiments on real imagery demonstrate that the proposed theory gives intuitive results."

The model uses probability distributions to describe the range of possible variation in the object's appearance. These distributions are organized on two levels. Large variations are handled by partitioning training images into clusters corresponding to distinctly different views of the object. Within each cluster, smaller variations are represented by distributions characterizing uncertainty in the presence, position, and measurements of various discrete features of appearance. Many types of features are used, ranging in abstraction from edge segments to perceptual groupings and regions. A matching procedure uses the feature uncertainty information to guide the search for a match between model and image. Hypothesized feature pairings are used to estimate a viewpoint transformation taking account of feature uncertainty. These methods have been implemented in an object recognition system, OLIVER. Experiments show that OLIVER is capable of learning to recognize complex objects in cluttered images, while acquiring models that represent those objects using relatively few views."

                "text": "In practice the relevant details of images exist only over a restricted range of scale. Hence it is important to study the dependence of image structure on the level of resolution. It seems clear enough that visual perception treats images on several levels of resolution simultaneously and that this fact must be important for the study of perception. However, no applicable mathematically formulated theory to deal with such problems appers to exist. In this paper it is shown that any image can be embedded in a one-parameter family of derived images (with resolution as the parameter) in essentially only one unique way if the constraint that no spurious detail should be generated when the resolution is diminished, is applied. The structure of this family is governed by the well known diffusion equation (a parabolic, linear, partial differential equation of the second order). As such the structure fits into existing theories that treat the front end of the visual system as a continuous tack of homogeneous layer, characterized by iterated local processing schemes. When resolution is decreased the images becomes less articulated because the extrem (\u201clight and dark blobs\u201d) disappear one after the other. This erosion of structure is a simple process that is similar in every case. As a result any image can be described as a juxtaposed and nested set of light and dark blobs, wherein each blod has a limited range of resolution in which it manifests itself. The structure of the family of derived images permits a derivation of the sampling density required to sample the image at multiple scales of resolution. The natural scale along the resolution axis (leading to an informationally uniform sampling density) is logarithmic, thus the structure is apt for the description of size invariances."
