In particular, the field of Information Extraction (IE), in which knowledge is extracted automatically from text, has shown promise for large-scale knowledge acquisition. While IE systems can uncover assertions about individual entities with an increasing level of sophistication,alltext understanding -- the formation of a coherent theory from a textual corpus -- involves representation and learning abilities not currently achievable by today's IE systems. Compared to individual relational assertions outputted by IE systems, a theory includes coherent knowledge of abstract concepts and the relationships among them. We believe that the ability to fully discover the richness of knowledge present within large, unstructured and heterogeneous corpora will require a lifelong learning process in which earlier learned knowledge is used to guide subsequent learning. This paper introduces Alice, a lifelong learning agent whose goal is to automatically discovera collection of concepts, facts and generalizations that describe a particular topic of interest directly from a large volume of Web text. Building upon recent advances in unsupervised information extraction, we demonstrate that Alice can iteratively discover new concepts and compose general domain knowledge with a precision of 78%."

Two goals motivate the approach: (i) avoidance of the need for pre-encoded knowledge and (ii) applicability across a wide range of text. We identify a set of lexico-syntactic patterns that are easily recognizable, that occur frequently and across text genre boundaries, and that indisputably indicate the lexical relation of interest. We describe a method for discovering these patterns and suggest that other lexical relations will also be acquirable in this way. A subset of the acquisition algorithm is implemented and the results are used to augment and critique the structure of a large hand-built thesaurus. Extensions and applications to areas such as information retrieval are suggested."

In its first major run, KNOWITALL extracted over 50,000 facts with high precision, but suggested a challenge: How can we improve KNOWITALL's recall and extraction rate without sacrificing precision? \n \nThis paper presents three distinct ways to address this challenge and evaluates their performance. Rule Learning learns domain-specific extraction rules. Subclass Extraction automatically identifies sub-classes in order to boost recall. List Extraction locates lists of class instances, learns a \"wrapper\" for each list, and extracts elements of each list. Since each method bootstraps from KNOWITALL's domain-independent methods, no hand-labeled training examples are required. Experiments show the relative coverage of each method and demonstrate their synergy. In concert, our methods gave KNOWITALL a 4-fold to 19-fold increase in recall, while maintaining high precision, and discovered 10,300 cities missing from the Tipster Gazetteer."

Semantic patterns are useful for a variety of text understanding tasks, in particular for locating events in text for information extraction. The method builds upon previously described approaches to iterative unsupervised pattern acquisition. One common characteristic of prior approaches is that the output of the algorithm is a continuous stream of patterns, with gradually degrading precision.Our method differs from the previous pattern acquisition algorithms in that it introduces competition among several scenarios simultaneously. This provides natural stopping criteria for the unsupervised learners, while maintaining good precision levels at termination. We discuss the results of experiments with several scenarios, and examine different aspects of the new procedure."

In this paper, we suggest a method for incorporating domain knowledge in semi-supervised learning algorithms. Our novel framework unies and can exploit several kinds of task specic constraints. The experimental results presented in the information extraction domain demonstrate that applying constraints helps the model to generate better feedback during learning, and hence the framework allows for high performance learning with significantly less training data than was possible before on these tasks."

In particular, we consider a problem setting motivated by the task of learning to classify web pages, in which the description of each example can be partitioned into two distinct views. For example, the description of a web page can be partitioned into the words occurring on that page, and the words occurring in hyperlinks t,hat point to that page. We assume that either view of the example would be sufficient for learning if we had enough labeled data, but our goal is to use both views together to allow inexpensive unlabeled data to augment, a much smaller set of labeled examples. Specifically, the presence of two distinct views of each example suggests strategies in which two learning algorithms are trained separately on each view, and then each algorithm\u2019s predictions on new unlabeled examples are used to enlarge the training set of the other. Our goal in this paper is to provide a PAC-style analysis for this setting, and, more broadly, a PAC-style framework for the general problem of learning from both labeled and unlabeled data. We also provide empirical results on real web-page data indicating that this use of unlabeled examples can lead to significant improvement of hypotheses in practice. *This research was supported in part by the DARPA HPKB program under contract F30602-97-1-0215 and by NSF National Young investigator grant CCR-9357793.

We also evaluated several kinds of wrappers for set expansion and showed that character-based wrappers perform better than HTML-based wrappers. In addition, we demonstrated a technique that extends SEAL to learn binary relational concepts (e.g., \"x is the mayor of the city y\") from only two seeds.

An active learner may pose queries, usually in the form of unlabeled data instances to be labeled by an oracle (e.g., a human annotator). Active learning is well-motivated in many modern machine learning problems, where unlabeled data may be abundant or easily obtained, but labels are difficult, time-consuming, or expensive to obtain. This report provides a general introduction to active learning and a survey of the literature. This includes a discussion of the scenarios in which queries can be formulated, and an overview of the query strategy frameworks proposed in the literature to date. An analysis of the empirical and theoretical evidence for successful active learning, a summary of problem setting variants and practical issues, and a discussion of related topics in machine learning research are also presented."

A large number of rules is needed for coverage of the domain, suggesting that a fairly large number of labeled examples should be required to train a classifier. However, we show that the use of unlabeled data can reduce the requirements for supervision to just 7 simple \"seed\" rules. The approach gains leverage from natural redundancy in the data: for many named-entity instances both the spelling of the name and the context inwhich it appears are sufficient to determine its type. We present two algorithms. The first method uses a similar algorithm to that of (Yarowsky 95), with modifications motivated by (Blum and Mitchell 98). The second algorithm extends ideas from boosting algorithms, designed for supervised learning tasks, to the framework suggested by (Blum and Mitchell 98)."

                "text": "The Hearsay-II system, developed during the DARPA-sponsored five-year speech-understanding research program, represents both a specific solution to the speech-understanding problem and a general framework for coordinating independent processes to achieve cooperative problem-solving behavior. As a computational problem, speech understanding reflects a large number of intrinsically interesting issues. Spoken sounds are achieved by a long chain of successive transformations, from intentions, through semantic and syntactic structuring, to the eventually resulting audible acoustic waves. As a consequence, interpreting speech means effectively inverting these transformations to recover the speaker's intention from the sound. At each step in the interpretive process, ambiguity and uncertainty arise. \n \nThe Hearsay-II problem-solving framework reconstructs an intention from hypothetical interpretations formulated at various levels of abstraction. In addition, it allocates limited processing resources first to the most promising incremental actions. The final configuration of the Hearsay-II system comprises problem-solving components to generate and evaluate speech hypotheses, and a focus-of-control mechanism to identify potential actions of greatest value. Many of these specific procedures reveal novel approaches to speech problems. Most important, the system successfully integrates and coordinates all of these independent activities to resolve uncertainty and control combinatorics. Several adaptations of the Hearsay-II framework have already been undertaken in other problem domains, and it is anticipated that this trend will continue; many future systems necessarily will integrate diverse sources of knowledge to solve complex problems cooperatively. \n \nDiscussed in this paper are the characteristics of the speech problem in particular, the special kinds of problem-solving uncertainty in that domain, the structure of the Hearsay-II system developed to cope with that uncertainty, and the relationship between Hearsay-II's structure and those of other speech-understanding systems. The paper is intended for the general computer science audience and presupposes no speech or artificial intelligence background."

Semi-supervised training using only a few labeled examples is typically unreliable because the learning task is underconstrained. This paper pursues the thesis that much greater accuracy can be achieved by further constraining the learning task, by coupling the semi-supervised training of many extractors for different categories and relations. We characterize several ways in which the training of category and relation extractors can be coupled, and present experimental results demonstrating significantly improved accuracy as a result."

A fundamental problem for both UIE and supervised IE is assessing the probability that extracted information is correct. In massive corpora such as the Web, the same extraction is found repeatedly in different documents. How does this redundancy impact the probability of correctness? \n \nThis paper introduces a combinatorial \"balls-andurns\" model that computes the impact of sample size, redundancy, and corroboration from multiple distinct extraction rules on the probability that an extraction is correct. We describe methods for estimating the model's parameters in practice and demonstrate experimentally that for UIE the model's log likelihoods are 15 times better, on average, than those obtained by Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) and the noisy-or model used in previous work.

We present a multilevel bootstrapping algorithm that generates both the semantic lexicon and extraction patterns simultaneously. As input, our technique requires only unannotated training texts and a handful of seed words for a category. We use a mutual bootstrapping technique to alternately select the best extraction pattern for the category and bootstrap its extractions into the semantic lexicon, which is the basis for selecting the next extraction pattern. To make this approach more robust, we add a second level of bootstrapping (metabootstrapping) that retains only the most reliable lexicon entries produced by mutual bootstrapping and then restarts the process. We evaluated this multilevel bootstrapping technique on a collection of corporate web pages and a corpus of terrorism news articles. The algorithm produced high-quality dictionaries for several semantic categories."

Their major weakness is that, without costly human intervention, the extracted terms (often rapidly) drift from the meaning of the original seed terms. In this paper we propose Mutual Exclusion bootstrapping (MEB) in which multiple semantic classes compete for each extracted term. This significantly reduces the problem of semantic drift by providing boundaries for the semantic classes. We demonstrate the superiority of MEB to standard bootstrapping in extracting named entities from the Google Web 1T 5-grams. Finally, we demonstrate that MEB is a multi-way cut problem over semantic classes, terms and contexts."

Lebiere, 1998) has evolved into a theory that consists of multiple modules but also explains how these modules are integrated to produce coherent cognition. The perceptual-motor modules, the goal module, and the declarative memory module are presented as examples of specialized systems in ACT-R. These modules are associated with distinct cortical regions. These modules place chunks in buffers where they can be detected by a production system that responds to patterns of information in the buffers. At any point in time, a single production rule is selected to respond to the current pattern. Subsymbolic processes serve to guide the selection of rules to fire as well as the internal operations of some modules. Much of learning involves tuning of these subsymbolic processes. A number of simple and complex empirical examples are described to illustrate how these modules function singly and in concert."

Information extraction(IE) is a form of shallow text understanding that locates specific pieces of data in natural language documents, transforming unstructured text into a structured database. This paper describes a system called DISCOTEX, that combines IE and data mining methodologies to perform text mining as well as improve the performance of the underlying extraction system. Rules mined from a database extracted from a corpus of texts are used to predict additional information to extract from future documents, thereby improving the recall of IE. Encouraging results are presented on applying these techniques to a corpus of computer job announcement postings from an Internet newsgroup."

Previous approaches to multitask learning usually deal with homogeneous tasks, such as purely regression tasks, or entirely classification tasks. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning multiple related tasks of predicting both continuous and discrete outputs from a common set of input variables that lie in a high-dimensional feature space. All of the tasks are related in the sense that they share the same set of relevant input variables, but the amount of influence of each input on different outputs may vary. We formulate this problem as a combination of linear regressions and logistic regressions, and model the joint sparsity as L1/L\u221e or L1/L2 norm of the model parameters. Among several possible applications, our approach addresses an important open problem in genetic association mapping, where the goal is to discover genetic markers that influence multiple correlated traits jointly. In our experiments, we demonstrate our method in this setting, using simulated and clinical asthma datasets, and we show that our method can effectively recover the relevant inputs with respect to all of the tasks."
