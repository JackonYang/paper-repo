Instead of classifying the sentiment of an entire document about a subject, SA detects all references to the given subject, and determines sentiment in each of the references using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Our sentiment analysis consists of 1) a topic specific feature term extraction, 2) sentiment extraction, and 3) (subject, sentiment) association by relationship analysis. SA utilizes two linguistic resources for the analysis: the sentiment lexicon and the sentiment pattern database. The performance of the algorithms was verified on online product review articles (\"digital camera\" and \"music\" reviews), and more general documents including general Webpages and news articles."

Recent interest in identifying overall affect or sentiment in text falls into the second category. Judging from the limited results reported so far, it appears to be a more challenging problem than topic identification. This is presumably because topic, to first approximation, can reasonably be represented by the straightforward accumulation of word content, whereas tone or affect -like meaning itself -depends on relationships of words with each other and with referents external to the text."

In this paper, we discuss a necessary component for an opinion question answering system: separating opinions from fact, at both the document and sentence level. We present a Bayesian classifier for discriminating between documents with a preponderance of opinions such as editorials from regular news stories, and describe three unsupervised, statistical techniques for the significantly harder task of detecting opinions at the sentence level. We also present a first model for classifying opinion sentences as positive or negative in terms of the main perspective being expressed in the opinion. Results from a large collection of news stories and a human evaluation of 400 sentences are reported, indicating that we achieve very high performance in document classification (upwards of 97% precision and recall), and respectable performance in detecting opinions and classifying them at the sentence level as positive, negative, or neutral (up to 91% accuracy)."

The classification of a review is predicted by the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs. A phrase has a positive semantic orientation when it has good associations (e.g., \"subtle nuances\") and a negative semantic orientation when it has bad associations (e.g., \"very cavalier\"). In this paper, the semantic orientation of a phrase is calculated as the mutual information between the given phrase and the word \"excellent\" minus the mutual information between the given phrase and the word \"poor\". A review is classified as recommended if the average semantic orientation of its phrases is positive. The algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 74% when evaluated on 410 reviews from Epinions, sampled from four different domains (reviews of automobiles, banks, movies, and travel destinations). The accuracy ranges from 84% for automobile reviews to 66% for movie reviews."

Ideally, an opinion mining tool would process a set of search results for a given item, generating a list of product attributes (quality, features, etc.) and aggregating opinions about each of them (poor, mixed, good). We begin by identifying the unique properties of this problem and develop a method for automatically distinguishing between positive and negative reviews. Our classifier draws on information retrieval techniques for feature extraction and scoring, and the results for various metrics and heuristics vary depending on the testing situation. The best methods work as well as or better than traditional machine learning. When operating on individual sentences collected from web searches, performance is limited due to noise and ambiguity. But in the context of a complete web-based tool and aided by a simple method for grouping sentences into attributes, the results are qualitatively quite useful."

The primary linguistic resource for fuzzy semantic typing is the fuzzy affect lexicon, from which other important resources are generated, notably the fuzzy thesaurus and affect category groups. Free text is tagged with affect categories from the lexicon, and the affect categories' centralities and intensities are combined using techniques from fuzzy logic to produce affect sets fuzzy sets that represent the affect quality of a document. We show different aspects of affect analysis using news stories and movie reviews. Our experiments show a very good correspondence of affect sets with human judgments of affect content. We ascribe this to the effective representation of ambiguity in our fuzzy affect lexicon, and the ability of fuzzy logic to deal successfully with the ambiguity of words in natural language. Planned extensions of the system include personalized profiles for Web-based content dissemination, fuzzy retrieval, clustering and classification."

A log-linear regression model uses these constraints to predict whether conjoined adjectives are of same or different orientations, achieving 82% accuracy in this task when each conjunction is considered independently. Combining the constraints across many adjectives, a clustering algorithm separates the adjectives into groups of different orientations, and finally, adjectives are labeled positive or negative. Evaluations on real data and simulation experiments indicate high levels of performance: classification precision is more than 90% for adjectives that occur in a modest number of conjunctions in the corpus."

We investigate the feasibility of applying link-based methods in new applications domains. The specific application we consider is to partition authors into opposite camps within a given topic in the context of newsgroups. A typical newsgroup posting consists of one or more quoted lines from another posting followed by the opinion of the author. This social behavior gives rise to a network in which the vertices are individuals and the links represent \"responded-to\" relationships. An interesting characteristic of many newsgroups is that people more frequently respond to a message when they disagree than when they agree. This behavior is in sharp contrast to the WWW link graph, where linkage is an indicator of agreement or common interest. By analyzing the graph structure of the responses, we are able to effectively classify people into opposite camps. In contrast, methods based on statistical analysis of text yield low accuracy on such datasets because the vocabulary used by the two sides tends to be largely identical, and many newsgroup postings consist of relatively few words of text."

In particular, this paper proposes an approach to multi-perspective question answering that views the task as one of opinion-oriented information extraction. We first describe an annotation scheme developed for the low-level representation of opinions, and note the results of interannotator agreement studies using the opinion-based annotation framework. Next, we propose the use of opinion-oriented \u201cscenario templates\u201d to act as a summary representation of the opinions expressed in a document, a set of documents, or an arbitrary text segment. Finally, we outline an approach for the automatic construction of opinion-based summary representations and describe how they might be used to support a variety of multi-perspective question answering tasks."

Previous approaches to textual affect sensing have employed keyword spotting, lexical affinity, statistical methods, and hand-crafted models. This paper demonstrates a new approach, using large-scale real-world knowledge about the inherent affective nature of everyday situations (such as \"getting into a car accident\") to classify sentences into \"basic\" emotion categories. This commonsense approach has new robustness implications.Open Mind Commonsense was used as a real world corpus of 400,000 facts about the everyday world. Four linguistic models are combined for robustness as a society of commonsense-based affect recognition. These models cooperate and compete to classify the affect of text. Such a system that analyzes affective qualities sentence by sentence is of practical value when people want to evaluate the text they are writing. As such, the system is tested in an email writing application. The results suggest that the approach is robust enough to enable plausible affective text user interfaces."

It is, however, very costly to collect and analyze survey data manually. This paper presents a new framework for mining product reputations on the Internet. It automatically collects people's opinions about target products from Web pages, and it uses text mining techniques to obtain the reputations of those products.On the basis of human-test samples, we generate in advance syntactic and linguistic rules to determine whether any given statement is an opinion or not, as well as whether such any opinion is positive or negative in nature. We first collect statements regarding target products using a general search engine, and then, using the rules, extract opinions from among them and attach three labels to each opinion, labels indicating the positive/negative determination, the product name itself, and an numerical value expressing the degree of system confidence that the statement is, in fact, an opinion. The labeled opinions are then input into an opinion database.The mining of reputations, i.e., the finding of statistically meaningful information included in the database, is then conducted. We specify target categories using label values (such as positive opinions of product A) and perform four types of text mining: extraction of 1) characteristic words, 2) co-occurrence words, 3) typical sentences, for individual target categories, and 4) correspondence analysis among multiple target categories.Actual marketing data is used to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the framework, which offers a drastic reduction in the overall cost of reputation analysis over that of conventional survey approaches and supports the discovery of knowledge from the pool of opinions on the web."

Such passages take a character's psychological point of view. A language understander must determine the current psychological point of view in order to distinguish the beliefs of the characters from the facts of the story, to correctly attribute beliefs and other attitudes to their sources, and to understand the discourse relations among sentences. Tracking the psychological point of view is not a trivial problem, because many sentences are not explicitly marked for point of view, and whether the point of view of a sentence is objective or that of a character (and if the latter, which character it is) often depends on the context in which the sentence appears. Tracking the psychological point of view is the problem addressed in this work. The approach is to seek, by extensive examinations of naturally occurring narrative, regularities in the ways that authors manipulate point of view, and to develop an algorithm that tracks point of view on the basis of the regularities found. This paper presents this algorithm, gives demonstrations of an implemented system, and describes the results of some preliminary empirical studies, which lend support to the algorithm."

The major restriction is that the energy function's smoothness term must only involve pairs of pixels. We propose two algorithms that use graph cuts to compute a local minimum even when very large moves are allowed. The first move we consider is an /spl alpha/-/spl beta/-swap: for a pair of labels /spl alpha/,/spl beta/, this move exchanges the labels between an arbitrary set of pixels labeled a and another arbitrary set labeled /spl beta/. Our first algorithm generates a labeling such that there is no swap move that decreases the energy. The second move we consider is an /spl alpha/-expansion: for a label a, this move assigns an arbitrary set of pixels the label /spl alpha/. Our second algorithm, which requires the smoothness term to be a metric, generates a labeling such that there is no expansion move that decreases the energy. Moreover, this solution is within a known factor of the global minimum. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration, stereo and motion."
