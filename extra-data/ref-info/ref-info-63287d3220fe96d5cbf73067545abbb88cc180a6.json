Query-by-Committee is used to actively select documents for labeling, then EM with a naive Bayes model further improves classiication accuracy by concurrently estimating probabilistic labels for the remaining unlabeled documents and using them to improve the model. We also present a metric for better measuring disagreement among committee members; it accounts for the strength of their disagreement and for the distribution of the documents. Experimental results show that our method of combining EM and active learning requires only half as many labeled training examples to achieve the same accuracy as either EM or active learning alone."

In this paper, we describe an active learning method that uses a committee of learners to reduce the number of training examples required for learning. Our approach is similar to the Query by Committee framework, where disagreement among the committee members on the predicted label for the input part of the example is used to signal the need for knowing the actual value of the label. Our experiments are conducted in the text categorization domain, which is characterized by a large number of features, many of which are irrelevant. We report here on experiments using a committee of Winnowbased learners and demonstrate that this approach can reduce the number of labeled training examples required over that used by a single Winnow learner by l-2 orders of magnitude. 1.

This paper shows that the accuracy of a naive Bayes text classi er can be signi cantly improved by taking advantage of a hierarchy of classes. We adopt an established statistical technique called shrinkage that smoothes parameter estimates of a data-sparse child with its parent in order to obtain more robust parameter estimates. The approach is also employed in deleted interpolation, a technique for smoothing n-grams in language modeling for speech recognition. Our method scales well to large data sets, with numerous categories in large hierarchies. Experimental results on three real-world data sets from UseNet, Yahoo, and corporate web pages show improved performance, with a reduction in error up to 29% over the traditional at classi er."

One can use existing classifiers by ignoring the hierarchical structure, treating the topics as separate classes. Unfortunately, in the context of text categorization, we are faced with a large number of classes and a huge number of relevant features needed to distinguish between them. Consequently, we are restricted to using only very simple classifiers, both because of computational cost and the tendency of complex models to overfit. We propose an approach that utilizes the hierarchical topic structure to decompose the classification task into a set of simpler problems, one at each node in the classification tree. As we show, each of these smaller problems can be solved accurately by focusing only on a very small set of features, those relevant to the task at hand. This set of relevant features varies widely throughout the hierarchy, so that, while the overall relevant feature set may be large, each classifier only examines a small subset. The use of reduced feature sets allows us to utilize more complex (probabilistic) models, without encountering the computational and robustness difficulties described above."

This situation arises, e.g., for medical images, where although training features may be plentiful, expensive expertise is required to extract their class labels. We propose a classifier structure and learning algorithm that make effective use of unlabelled data to improve performance. The learning is based on maximization of the total data likelihood, i.e. over both the labelled and unlabelled data subsets. Two distinct EM learning algorithms are proposed, differing in the EM formalism applied for unlabelled data. The classifier, based on a joint probability model for features and labels, is a \"mixture of experts\" structure that is equivalent to the radial basis function (RBF) classifier, but unlike RBFs, is amenable to likelihood-based training. The scope of application for the new method is greatly extended by the observation that test data, or any new data to classify, is in fact additional, unlabelled data - thus, a combined learning/classification operation - much akin to what is done in image segmentation - can be invoked whenever there is new data to classify. Experiments with data sets from the UC Irvine database demonstrate that the new learning algorithms and structure achieve substantial performance gains over alternative approaches."

Categorization of text is of increasing importance in information retrieval and natural language processing systems. Previous research on automated text categorization has mixed machine learning and knowledge engineering methods, making it diicult to draw conclusions about the performance of particular methods. In this paper we present empirical results on the performance of a Bayesian classiier and a decision tree learning algorithm on two text categorization data sets. We nd that both algorithms achieve reasonable performance and allow controlled tradeoos between false positives and false negatives. The stepwise feature selection in the decision tree algorithm is particularly eeective in dealing with the large feature sets common in text categorization. However, even this algorithm is aided by an initial preeltering of features, connrming the results found by Almuallim and Dietterich on artiicial data sets. We also demonstrate the impact of the time-varying nature of category deenitions."

Some use a multi-variate Bernoulli model, that is, a Bayesian Network with no dependencies between words and binary word features (e.g. Larkey and Croft 1996; Koller and Sahami 1997). Others use a multinomial model, that is, a uni-gram language model with integer word counts (e.g. Lewis and Gale 1994; Mitchell 1997). This paper aims to clarify the confusion by describing the differences and details of these two models, and by empirically comparing their classification performance on five text corpora. We find that the multi-variate Bernoulli performs well with small vocabulary sizes, but that the multinomial performs usually performs even better at larger vocabulary sizes--providing on average a 27% reduction in error over the multi-variate Bernoulli model at any vocabulary size."

These algorithms both construct classifiers that allow the \u201ccontext\u201d of a word w to affect how (or even whether) the presence or absence of w will contribute to a classification. However, RIPPER and sleeping-experts differ radically in many other respects: differences include different notions as to what constitutes a context, different ways of combining contexts to construct a classifier, different methods to search for a combination of contexts, and different criteria as to what contexts should be included in such a combination. In spite of these differences, both RIPPER and sleeping-experts perform extremely well across a wide variety of categorization problems, generally outperforming previously applied learning methods. We view this result as a confirmation of the usefulness of classifiers that represent contextual information."

We discovered that the knowledge about relevance among queries and documents can be used to obtain empirical connections between query terms and the canonical concepts which are used for indexing the content of documents. These connections do not depend on whether there are shared terms among the queries and documents; therefore, they are especially effective for a mapping from queries to the documents where the concepts are relevant but the terms used by article authors happen to be different from the terms of database users. We employ a Linear Least Squares Fit (LLSF) technique to compute such connections from a collection of queries and documents where the relevance is assigned by humans, and then use these connections in the retrieval of documents where the relevance is unknown. We tested this method on both retrieval and indexing with a set of MEDLINE documents which has been used by other information retrieval systems for evaluations. The effectiveness of the LLSF mapping and the significant improvement over alternative approaches was evident in the tests."

In this paper we study the properties of phrasal and clustered indexing languages on a text categorization task, enabling us to study their properties in isolation from query interpretation issues. We show that optimal effectiveness occurs when using only a small proportion of the indexing terms available, and that effectiveness peaks at a higher feature set size and lower effectiveness level for a syntactic phrase indexing than for word-based indexing. We also present results suggesting that traditional term clustering method are unlikely to provide significantly improved text representations.

One important feature of the model is that the tf statistic, which usually appears in probabilistic IR models as a heuristic, is an integral part of the model. Another is that the variable length of documents is accounted for, without either making a uniform length assumption or using length normalization. The multinomial model employs independence assumptions which are similar to assumptions made in previous probabilistic models, particularly the binary independence model and the 2-Poisson model. The use of simulation to study the model is described. Performance of the model is evaluated on the TREC-3 routing task. Results are compared with the binary independence model and with the simulation studies."

K-nearest-neighbor, relevance feedback, and Bayesian independence classifers were applied individually and in combination. A combination of diierent classiiers produced better results than any single type of classiier. For this speciic medical categoriza-tion problem, new query formulation and weighting methods used in the k-nearest-neighbor classiier improved performance. 1 Introduction Past research in information retrieval has shown that one can improve retrieval eeectiveness by using multiple representations in indexing and query formulation 27] 19] 3] 11] and by using multiple search strategies 5] 24] 7]. In this work, we investigate whether we can attain similar improvements in the domain of text categorization by combining diierent representations and classiication methods. Our domain is the automatic assignment of ICD9 codes to dictated inpatient discharge summaries. There is a great deal of interest in automating the assignment of categories such as ICD9-CM and other codes to patient medical records. Many hours of human eeort go into this task. Because this coding determines reimbursement, it is important to accomplish this task as easily and as accurately as possible. The most common approaches use a large corpus of previously coded documents to infer codes for new documents. Many diierent algorithms have been used for text cate-gorization, including k-nearest-neighbor algorithms 6, 26, 18], Bayesian independence classiiers 13], relevance feedback 21], and rule-induction algorithms from machine learning , like decision trees 2, 16]. These categorization algorithms have been applied to many diierent subject domains, usually news stories, but also physics abstracts 9], and medical text 29]. We are following several of these approaches to automatic"

The goal of the research described here is to automatically create a computer understandable world wide knowledge base whose content mirrors that of the World Wide Web. Such a knowledge base would enable much more effective retrieval of Web information, and promote new uses of the Web to support knowledge-based inference and problem solving. Our approach is to develop a trainable information extraction system that takes two inputs: an ontology defining the classes and relations of interest, and a set of training data consisting of labeled regions of hypertext representing instances of these classes and relations. Given these inputs, the system learns to extract information from other pages and hyperlinks on the Web. This paper describes our general approach, several machine learning algorithms for this task, and promising initial results with a prototype system."

No explanation for this has been proposed so far. In this paper we show that the SBC does not in fact assume attribute independence, and can be optimal even when this assumption is violated by a wide margin. The key to this nding lies in the distinction between classi cation and probability estimation: correct classi cation can be achieved even when the probability estimates used contain large errors. We show that the previously-assumed region of optimality of the SBC is a second-order in nitesimal fraction of the actual one. This is followed by the derivation of several necessary and several su cient conditions for the optimality of the SBC. For example, the SBC is optimal for learning arbitrary conjunctions and disjunctions, even though they violate the independence assumption. The paper also reports empirical evidence of the SBC's competitive performance in domains containing substantial degrees of attribute dependence. 1 THE SIMPLE BAYESIAN"

Furthermore, by ex- periments, we show that by using additional unlabeled samples more representative estimates can be obtained.

The user rates explored pages on a three point scale, and Syskill & Webert learns a user profile by analyzing the information on each page. The user profile can be used in two ways. First, it can be used to suggest which links a user would be interested in exploring. Second, it can be used to construct a LYCOS query to find pages that would interest a user. We compare six different algorithms from machine learning and information retrieval on this task. We find that the naive Bayesian classifier offers several advantages over other learning algorithms on this task. Furthermore, we find that an initial portion of a web page is sufficient for making predictions on its interestingness substantially reducing the amount of network transmission required to make predictions."

The labels /spl theta//sub i/ are independent random variables satisfying Pr{/spl theta//sub i/=1}=/spl eta/, Pr{/spl theta//sub i/=2}=1-/spl eta/. The labeled observations X/sub i/ are independently distributed with conditional density f/sub /spl theta/i/(/spl middot/) given /spl theta//sub i/. Let (X/sub 0/,/spl theta//sub 0/) be a new sample, independently distributed as the samples in the training set. We observe X/sub 0/ and we wish to infer the classification /spl theta//sub 0/. In this paper we first assume that the distributions f/sub 1/(/spl middot/) and f/sub 2/(/spl middot/) are given and that the mixing parameter is unknown. We show that the relative value of labeled and unlabeled samples in reducing the risk of optimal classifiers is the ratio of the Fisher informations they carry about the parameter /spl eta/. We then assume that two densities g/sub 1/(/spl middot/) and g/sub 2/(/spl middot/) are given, but we do not know whether g/sub 1/(/spl middot/)=f/sub 1/(/spl middot/) and g/sub 2/(/spl middot/)=f/sub 2/(/spl middot/) or if the opposite holds, nor do we know /spl eta/. Thus the learning problem consists of both estimating the optimum partition of the observation space and assigning the classifications to the decision regions. Here, we show that labeled samples are necessary to construct a classification rule and that they are exponentially more valuable than unlabeled samples."

Thus resource availability, influenced by environmental conditions, may be particularly important during offspring development. This study examined the influence of a haematophagous ectoparasite Carnus hemapterus (Diptera: Milichiidae) in relation to environmental conditions on the growth, immune response, and health of nestling European Bee-eaters (Merops apiaster). The abundance of this bloodsucking ectoparasite per nest was experimentally manipulated to determine its impact on nestling body condition, immune system function in terms of T-cell-mediated and humoral immune response, and two health parameters, sedimentation rate and haematocrit level. Results indicate a significant negative effect of C. hemapterus intensity on nestling body condition and immune response, and on one blood parameter (haematocrit levels). Nestling body condition, \u03b3-globulin levels, wing web swelling, and haematocrit levels increased when parasites were removed. Although a broad spectrum of fitness indicators seems to be affected, no difference in nestling mortality during the experiment was observed between the two treatment groups.
