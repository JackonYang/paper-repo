These points are the boundaries between successive step functions which adequately represent a reduced form of the picture suitable for encoding in a compression scheme. \"Suitable here means an adequate representation of the picture as judged by eye. The device is based upon a statistical inference process which effectively leads to discrimination between the video signal and the background random noise based upon the fact that the statistical properties of successive picture points are different for the picture itself and for the noise."

More efficient coding of transmitted pictorial information and more efficient utilization of humanly produced information could result from its solution. The problem of pattern recognition has been stated as the assignment of a meaningful code to a recognizable structure in a set of signals. The signals, in this case organized spatially, are the result of a transformation from a visual picture field P to an electrical representation of this field. The points of this signal field S correspond to a characteristic of points in the picture. In this study, the reflectivity of given picture-point areas is quantized as black or white as a basis for a two-state electrical-signal representation of points of a pattern."

Where the goal is extraction of information and where the image is to be processed prior to viewing, the information content of the image is the only true evaluation criterion. Under these conditions, the improvement achieved by processing can be evaluated by comparing the ability of the human observer to extract information from the image before and after processing. The extent to which the processing approaches the optimum can be evaluated by determining the fraction of the total information content of the image which can be visually extracted after processing. The basic mathematical concepts of image processing are indicated, relating the input point spread function (p. s. f. of the unprocessed image), the processing point spread function (p. s. f. which defines the processing operation), and the output point spread function (p. s. f. of the processed image), and their Fourier domain equivalents. Examples are shown of images which have been processed and the details of the processing operations are described."

This processing is done manually in many applications. Thus, such inputs as punched cards, magnetic tape, and punched paper tape often are the result of a manual processing operation in which a human being is required to inspect visually an array of printed characters and to describe these data in a form capable of being processed by machine. In recognition of the importance of automating such operations, many investigations have been undertaken to devise automatic character sensing equipment. Suppose, however, that we attempt to view such efforts in proper perspective. We find a more fundamental problem that has, heretofore, failed to receive the attention that it warrants. The problem is one of making directly available to a computer pictorial information which would ordinarily be visually processed by human beings before being fed to a data processing system. This pictorial information may range from such highly stylized forms as printed characters, diagrams, schematic drawings, emblems, and designs through less stylized forms in cartoons and handwritten characters to such highly amorphous forms as photographs of real objects, e.g., people, aerial views, and microscopic and telescopic images."

In this paper, we find the optimum restoration of a noisy image by the criterion that expectation \u3008 \u2223Oj-O\u00afj\u2223K\u3009 be a minimum. Subscript j denotes the spatial frequency \u03c9j at which the unknown object spectrum O\u00af is to be restored, O\u00af denotes the optimum restoration by this criterion, and K is any positive number at the user\u2019s discretion. In general, such processing is nonlinear and requires the use of an electronic computer. Processor O\u00af uses the presence of known, Markov-image statistics to enhance the restoration quality and permits the image-forming phenomenon to obey an arbitrary law Ij = \u2112(\u03c4j, Oj, Nj). Here, \u03c4j denotes the intrinsic system characteristic (usually the optical transfer function), and Nj represents a noise function. When restored values O\u00af j, j=1, 2, \u22ef, are used as inputs to the band-unlimited restoration procedure (derived in a previous paper), the latter is optimized for the presence of noise. The optimum O\u00af j is found to be the root of a finite polynomial. When the particular value K=2 is used, the root O\u00af j is known analytically. Particular restorations O\u00af j are found for the case of additive, independent, gaussian detection noise and a white object region. These restorations are graphically compared with that due to conventional, linear processing."

The number n of video frames varied from 2 to 2048. Enhancement of signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio went nearly as VII, and S/N ratios of 1700:1 were obtained in about 1 min. A new design is presented to raise the digitizing rate from the present 180 kHz to 2.4 MHz in order to improve resolution. The application is to the measurement of solar magnetic fields, which are proportional to small differences between solar pictures of opposite polarization. A sensitivity increase of NTri and real time display will provide a possible solar flare warning system. Other applications are mentioned."

It can perform a large variety of linear operations upon the object or input. In general, it is difficult to produce complex filters, since both amplitude transmission and phase delay may vary across the filter plane in a complicated manner. Our own filters which are very similar to binary holograms, consist of many little transparent rectangles on opaque background. They can easily be drawn on a large scale by a computer-guided plotter, and then photographically reduced in size. We show that our filters, despite containing only amplitude values zero and one, can perform any data processing operation which could be performed by any complex filter. After explaining the principle, we present three groups of applications. First, we describe new versions of some classical methods: schlieren observation and phase contrast. Next, we report on spatial which perform differential operations upon the object in order to enhance gradients or corners. Finally, we use our binary filters for signal detection."

The filter has the capability of recognizing and classifying three-dimensional objects regardless of their size and orientation with respect to the viewing mechanism. The applications of the techniques include reconnaissance, photo interpretation, and star field recognition for space probes. Self-organization was used as a design tool only; the decision filter itself is not adaptive. Design principles described here are directly applicable to an even wider variety of problems in the broad areas of communication and data processing. A natural selection process of eliminating elements of marginal utility enables a significant reduction of network size without adversely affecting its classification capability. Full advantage was taken of the self-organization process to minimize the engineering design task involved. Many of the features described have not previously been reported in the literature."

Little attention'12 has been paid to techniques for dynamic character recognition, i.e., examination during the time of formation, presumably because such processes have tended to be inefficient as communication techniques and wasteful of computer time. With the recent interest in closer man-machine coupling3 and the development of computer time-sharing techniques' to make such coupling economic, it is important to consider ways to utilize manual printing as a link to a computer system, particularly since the size and nature of the character sets available on convention keyboards is restricted compared to the symbol requirements in many disciplines. For example, it would be very useful to be able to describe a mathematic expression to a FORTRAN compiler using normal mathematical forms including integral signs, etc."

This ability of the human observer suggests that completely automatic operation might at least partially separate noise and picture. A nonstationary, nonlinear operation has been found which selectively removes moderate amounts of additive Gaussian noise from a received picture signal. Running tests are performed upon the signal to detect the presence of perceptually significant picture detail in a number of different categories. Depending upon the test results, a selection is made from a number of available smoothing filter modes to maximize the suppression of noise without picture blurring. No preparatory operation is required at the transmitter, so that the technique is compatible with existing picture transmission systems. The process is applicable to conventional broadcast television, and could in principle be incorporated in home receivers to improve reception in fringe areas."

The resulting transparencies of the degraded images were digitized by a photoelectric scanner and processed on a digital computer. The processing consisted of applying corrections to the amplitude and phase coefficients of the two-dimensional Fourier series representing the degraded images. The correction factors were obtained from the optical transfer function of the turbulence measured at the time the images were photographed. The experiment was done for 5-msec and 1-min exposure times. The processed data were used to generate photographs. The processed images were found to have significantly more visual detail than the original degraded images; the 5-msec-exposure restorations were superior to the 1-min-exposure restorations."

The discussion will consider scenes having a fair degree of generality, namely those that can be made out of arbitrary lines. Let us think of lines as being collections of points, visual shapes as being collections of lines, and visual scenes as being collections of points, lines, and shapes. Thus, any linedrawing qualifies as a scene in our sense. The collection of points shown in FIGURE 1, for example, is considered as forming two lines, one fairly straight, the other looping on itself. Handprinted alphanumeric characters, as in FIGURE 2, provide examples of visual shapes. * An example of visual scene is shown in FIGURE 3. The elements of this scene are the alphanumeric characters S, E, and G, and some additional lines and points. In principle, any photograph can be reduced to a visual scene by suitable computer processing.' By scene analysis we mean the process whereby the shapes contained in a scene are discovered, and identifying information about each shape is generated (e.g., name, size, position). The Cyclops-1 system' performs scene analysis in the above sense. If the scene shown in the first frame of FIGURE 3 is presented to the system, then the sequence of the remaining three frames of FIGURE 3 will be produced as output. In each of these three frames, the system has intensified a certain group of points to indicate that these points define a shape known to the system. In connection with the last three frames of FIGURE 3, the system also provides a8 additional information the name, the size, and the position of the shape in the field of view. Let us explain briefly how Cyclops-1 works. The first stage consists of line-forming, a process whereby the individual points are organized into lines. In this stage the points shown in FIGURE 1, e.g., are separated into two lines, and the points in each lines are ordered according to their position along the 1ine.t"

This result, which has intuitive appeal, is obtained from the two-dimensional matched filter \u201coptimum\u201d for detecting known signals immersed in a typical low-frequency, isotropic, additive background. Truly spatial (i.e., simultaneously in two dimensions) high-pass filtering is achieved for high-contrast object scenes in an experimental correlator in which bipolar transmittance is effectively obtained by using the known quenching characteristics of a fluorescent screen.A table of bipolar aperture masks is given for approximating various partial derivatives for edge enhancement. This table indicates that some earlier experiments with negative light may be interpreted as essentially optical differentiation, examples of which are given."

                "text": "The problem which concerns us may be stated as follows: A digital computer receives information about a plane black-and-white pattern, and is to decide on the basis of this infoim~ation whether the pattern is \"similar\", in some sense to be specified below, to a given prototype. It is usually assumed that the patterns considered are of bounded size, say each contained in a given rectangle. Thus a pattern may be defined as any subset of the points in the rectangle, namely, the subset of \"black\" points. The information given to the computer must be of finite length; usually the rectangle is covered by a finite number of cells, and the information to the computer amounts to signals indicating whether any given cell is white or black. Patterns used as prototypes may be, for example, a ring, the letter \"A\", or the like. The recognition of alphabetic and numerical characters is of particular practical importance. What constitutes \"similarity\" varies widely from ease to case, and the methods which the machine uses in recognizing similarity must vary accordingly. To give two extreme examples, one might call two patterns similar only if they agree point for point (or rather, cell for cell) ; or else, one might admit as similar two patterns which are topo-logically equivalent (after defining a suitable topology in the space of cells), so that e.g. any simple closed curve would be called similar to a circle. 3/fany intermediate definitions are possible. In particular, for the recognition of printed characters one will wish to admit as similar two patterns if they differ at most in the following respects: (A) Location (B) Size (C) \"Stretching\" and \"Squeezing\" in either X-or Y-direction. Mathematically , these are affine transformations preserving the X-and Y-directions, i.e., transformations of the form X* = aX + b, Y* = cY + d. The special ease a = c = 1 corresponds to translations, i.e. to (A). (D) While one might consider rotation through a small angle as admissible, rotations through large angles are obviously not; e.g. the characters \"6\" and \"9\" should be recognized as different. It seems preferable to omit rotation entirely and admit in its place \"slanting\" such as occurs in italic type by comparison with roman. Mathematically, this is characterized as an affine transformation which leaves the points of the X-axis fixed. Combinations of the transformations (A) and (D) ex-240"

The method may be applied to any form of spatial pattern, but in the present instance, patterns consisting of line figures are considered. The pattern is presented to a flying-spot scanner connected to a digital computer. The shape of the pattern is analysed and a statement is prepared describing the basic features of the pattern. The pattern is then recognized by comparing this statement with a number of others already stored in the computer which relate to named patterns. Patterns are recognized independently of the angle at which they are presented to the scanner, and may be of any size provided that limits imposed by the resolution of the scanner are not exceeded. The average time to recognize a character is 60 seconds with the system programmed on a medium-speed computer. Special-purpose equipment built to perform certain of the stages of the process, together with the use of higher-speed computers now envisaged, will reduce this time by at least a thousandfold. If a new pattern is presented to the machine it will indicate its inability to recognize the pattern, but by giving the machine the name of the pattern, it may become one of the standard patterns which it can subsequently recognize. All the patterns recognized by the machine are hand-drawn and consist of such symbols as the capital letters of the alphabet and numerals, although the system is in no way limited to any special set of characters. Using exactly the same method but with an increase in the degree of complexity, it will be possible for machines to read handwriting. Special allowances are made for imperfections in the patterns, including breaks and general ill-definition. Where there is some confusion and an unknown pattern resembles two or more of the standard patterns, the relative degrees of similarity of the unknown to each of these standard patterns is printed out by the machine."

Coherent optical systems have the added property that one may easily obtain many successive two-dimensional Fourier transforms of any given light amplitude distribution, or, by use of astigmatic optics, one-dimensional transforms can be obtained. Therefore, most linear operations of an integral transform nature are easily implemented. The optical implementation of integral transforms which are of importance to communication theory is discussed; the general problems of optical filter synthesis and multichannel computation and data processing are introduced, followed by a discussion of potential applications. Astigmatic systems, which permit multichannel operation in lieu of two-dimensional processing, are treated as a special case of general two-dimensional processors. Complex input functions are discussed with relation to their role in coherent optical systems."

Since then much work has been done in applying this to bubble chamber pictures. The parallel processing simulator, originally written for an IBM 7094 system, has now been rewritten for a CDC 3600 system. This paper describes briefly the structure of syntactic descriptive models by considering their specific application to bubble chamber pictures. How the description generated in this phase can be embedded in a larger \u201cconversation\u201d program is explained by means of a certain specific example that has been worked out. A partial generative grammar for \u201chandwritten\u201d English letters is given, as are also a few computer-generated outputs using this grammar and the parallel processing simulator mentioned earlier."

One processor, the Pattern Articulation Unit (PAU), has been singled out for detailed discussion. Other units, in particular the Arithmetic Unit and the Taxicrinic Unit, are treated in reports listed in the bibliography. The PAU has been shown to be a processor of fundamentally new design-its logical organization has no analog in the central processing unit of existing computers. The PAU is the first modular parallel processor which because of its digital organization is capable of more reliable visual identification than part analog/part digital preprocessors of much less generality and potential virtuosity; is faster than any presently suggested alternative realizable today at comparable cost; and can serve as a prototype to a new generation of parallel computers that will capitalize upon thin film and integrated semiconductor circuitry of the immediate future."

These areas probably are of doubtful visual significance in the sense that their brightness values could be highly distorted without materially degrading the subjective appearance of the picture."

It is shown that there are a number of ways of encoding arbitrary geometric curves to facilitate such manipulations, each having its own particular advantages and disadvantages. One method, the so-called rectangular-array type of encoding, is discussed in detail. In this method the slope function is quantized into a set of eight standard slopes. This particular representation is one of the simplest and one that is most readily utilized with present-day computing and display equipment."

A computer-controlled scanner is used to acquire the characters, to adjust the raster resolution and registration, and to monitor the black-white threshold of the quantizer. The dimensionality of the decision problem is reduced by a hybrid system of measurements. In the measurement design, three types of measurements are generated: a set of \"topological\" measurements, a set of logical \"n-tuples,\" both designed by hand, and a large set of n-tuples machine generated at random under special constraints. The final set of 100 measurements is selected automatically by a programmed algorithm that attempts to minimize the maximum expected error rate between every character pair. Computer simulation experiments show the effectiveness of the selection procedure, the contribution of the different types of measurements, the effect of the number of measurements selected on recognition, and the desirability of size and shear normalization. The final system is tested on four data sets printed under different degrees of control on the writers. Each data set consists of approximately 10 000 characters. For this comparison, a first-order maximum likelihood function with weights quantized to 100 levels is used. Error versus reject curves are given on several combinations of training and test sets."

New acquisition techniques, equipment, and sensors, plus a growing demand for rapidly obtained, accurate information necessitate machine performance of tasks presently accomplished by observers and interpreters. Many of these tasks can be described as pattern recognition or information processing functions. This paper discusses significant problems encountered when attempting to identify objects or regions automatically from aerial photography. Problems include sensor distortions, variations in target environment, and concepts of design and \"teaching\" of an actual device. Operational requirements such as processing speed and flexibility restrict the types of solutions available. Approaches to target recognition with relative merits and shortcomings are presented; these include shape correlation, feature extraction, and image quantization. The effect of mission requirements on system parameters is discussed. A bibliography is included."

Computer-aided design is based on a real-time graphical dialogue between the man and the computer in which the man draws on a display by means of a \"light pen\" or other input device. The computer \"understands\" the picture, makes calculations based on it, and presents the results pictorially to the user for his approval or revision. This man-computer graphical conversation has been made possible by recent advances in the speed of the digital computer, time-sharing programming, computer-driven display technology, and graphical input devices. The light pen is the most commonly used graphical input device, but keyboards, joysticks, flat matrix arrays, and other devices are also used. The programming state-of-the-art is a limiting factor in the implementatation of graphical computer-aided design; much work remains to be done in systems programming, efficient time sharing, list structure concepts, file organization, and memory protection. A number of experimental equipment configurations in use in various laboratories are cited and the hardware state-of-the-art is reviewed. Several experimental and production applications of computer-aided design evolved in a large aircraft company are described and illustrated, by display photographs. These applications relate to structural analysis, dynamics, information retrieval, accounting, and numerical control tape preparation. For the future, advances are required in improved man-computer communication, techniques to permit the operation of displays at great distances from the central computer, and methods of inputting existing drawings into the computer in a meaningful form."

Solution of such an integral equation when the data are corrupted by noise or experimental error is treated as the problem of finding an estimate that is a linear functional of the data and minimizes the mean squared error between the true solution and itself. The estimate depends on assumptions about the spectral densities of the images and the noise, the choice of which is discussed. Coherent optical processing and digital processing are described."

It is found that, for a given process and emulsion, the differential height of the surface relief between minimum and maximum density points is strongly dependent on frequency. For a given peak-to-peak density swing, the relief height is very small at zero frequency, builds up to a maximum at a spatial frequency which is inversely proportional to the emulsion thickness, and then declines slowly with increasing spatial frequency. The effect is explained in terms of the differential tanning action of the developer between high- and low-exposure regions. The effect has been studied as a function of several emulsion parameters, processing, spatial frequency, peak-to-peak density swing, and emulsion thickness."

At many tasks, such as the solution of systems of linear equations, these machines are thousands of times as fast as human beings. However, they are relatively inept at solving many problems where the data is arranged naturally in a spatial form. For example, when it comes to playing chess or recognizing sophisticated patterns, present day machines cannot match the performance of their designers. The difficulty in such cases appears to be that conventional computers can actively cope with only a small amount of information at any one time. (This circumstance is aptly illustrated by the title of an article by Samuel, \"Computing Bit by Bit.\") It appears that efficient handling of problems of the type mentioned above cannot be accomplished without some form of parallel action. A stored program computer is described which can handle spatial problems by operating directly on information in planar form without scanning or using other techniques for transforming the problem into some other domain. The order structure of this machine is explained and illustrated by a few simple programs. An estimate of the size of the computer (based on one possible design) is given. Programs have been written that enable the machine to recognize alphabetic characters independent of position, proportion, and size."

It is shown that even when all spatial frequencies associated with image detail are removed by high-pass filtering, the square-law rectification of grain noise reproduces a recognizable image. A similar effect is shown to occur for halftone images. A simple explanation is provided for halftones which agrees well with experiment. A linear theory is also given for the case of granularity. Experimental results, relating macroscopic density measurements in the original and the filtered image, show argeement to the theory for fine-grain films, while results for coarse-grain films suggest minor deviations."

The required analyses are equivalent to taking inner products of pairs of vectors only one of which is variable in each case. Subsequently, the necessary network may be realized with fixed threshold logic, independent of the character classes to be recognized. The effectiveness of the property filter has been confirmed with printed and handwritten numerals by coupling it to a standard adaptive categorizer of a type assuming linear separability.

The picture sources are the largely schematic pictures that occur in the same class of documents. However, the discussion is broadened slightly to include other picture sources. For a tiny fragment of English, the paper shows how the syntactic structure of text may be described, and then goes on to suggest that a similar analysis may be performed on the class of pictures under study. The description of these two kinds of information sources with a single class of descriptive techniques is suggested as an alternative to the synthetic approach in which artificial languages are specified and then learned and used. The major reason for doing syntactical analysis of such sources discussed here is that several information processing operations, amounting to the interpretation of the information sources looked upon as languages, can be done by the technique of syntax direction which uses the results of syntactic analysis to mediate subsequent processes for manipulating the information tokens. The paper concludes with an illustration of an algorithm for matching the sentences given by a simple grammar against the class of simple pictures which these sentences purport to describe."

For good picture quality using standard PCM transmission, at least six bits are required at each sample point, since the eye is very sensitive to the small intensity steps introduced by quantization. However, by simply adding some noise to the signal before it is quantized and subtracting the same noise at the receiver, the quantization steps can be broken up and the source rate reduced to three bits per sample. Pseudo-random number generators can be synchronized at the transmitter and receiver to provide the identical \"noise\" which makes the process possible. Thus, with the addition of only a small amount of equipment, the efficiency of a PCM channel can be doubled."

Much of this data is in the form of pictures: photomicrographs, electron micrographs, X-ray films, Schlieren photographs, X-ray diffraction patterns, autoradiographs, time-lapse films, cineradiographs, or the like. Individual pictures hold a great wealth of precise numerical information, such as the morphological and structural characteristics of lengths, areas, volumes, and densities. From sequences of pictures, quantitative results can be derived, such as the kinematic and dynamic characteristics of trajectories. Such pictures relate to almost every field of biomedical research: chromosome karyograms in cytogenetics, angiogram cineradiographs in cardiology, Schlieren photographs in ultracentrifugal molecular-weight determinations, autoradiographs of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the study of leukemia, Golgi-stained neuron photomicrographs in the study of the ontogeny and phylogeny of the brain, X rays of bones in studies of calcium density distribution in orthopedic diseases, X rays of epiphysial plates of the hand in investigations of accurate physiological age, X-ray crystallographic plates in protein structure determination, electron micrographs in the investigation of the fine structure of virus particles, motion pictures of marine crustaceans in the detection of their sensitivity to polarized light, tissue-culture time-lapse films in the investigation of cancer-cell motility, and many others."

A mathematical model of the space of hand-written numerals constrained to be a bounded portion of a plane is developed first. Each numeral is transformed into a real function of a real variable by means of a procedure involving horizontal and vertical scanning of the pattern. The functions thus obtained are defined in an interval normalized to [0, 1], are uniformly bounded, piecewise continuous and non-negative. They form a sub-set of the Hilbert space L 2[0, 1 ]. An operator technique in L 2 is then employed to achieve clustering and recognition. When there are m classes S i of patterns, the outcome of the application of the ith operator H i (followed by a normalization) decides if an unclassified pattern belongs or not to S i . The operators are abstracted from a learning set composed of representative samples of the classes. This requires the determination of functions F i and G i..."

A constructive method, which can be readily programmed for computer processing, is proposed for finding the shortest scanning path realizable for any given set. In the case of noise, scanning paths are sought which maintain a prescribed minimal \"distance'' between the patterns, and hence yield a prescribed level of error-detecting capability.

The particular contribution of the paper is a more complete analysis of the effects of various types of noise on system performance than has been given previously. Background noise, measurement noise, and computer roundoff error are considered, and the errors in the reconstructed image caused by these noise processes are evaluated. Numerical results for the special case of a perfect one-dimensional slit aperture are obtained. A general conclusion is that the reconstruction technique described here is most useful when the smoothing is severe and when a modest improvement of resolution may be worthwhile."

Three problems have been presented to such a machine: hand-print classification, blood-cell sorting and target identification in gray-scale aerial photographs. Performance of decision functions utilizing corrective training were compared with that obtained by a simple form of Bayes' weighting. In general, the technique of corrective training was found to yield markedly superior results over the training sequence, but the ability to generalize or recognize samples not included in the training sequence was found to be about the same for the two techniques. Analysis of the experimental data permitted a quantitative evaluation of the effects of statistical dependence in the system together with a prediction of terminal error rates for the condition in which the number of A units is made infinitely large."

Also described is an optical configuration that can easily search for the scale of a signal, as well as its location and orientation. The use of a prism in the optical configuration simplifies the search for the orientation and scale of the signal. The spatial carrier-frequency filter introduces some aberrations, but only astigmatism and distortion remain uncorrected. The necessary magnitude of the spatial carrier frequency depends upon the size of the signal and of the input data. A natural extension of this consideration leads directly to a corresponding requirement on the spatial carrier frequencies for multiplexed filters."

This program consists of two subroutines: (1) to search for logic circuits having certain constraints on hardware design, and (2) to evaluate these logics in terms of their discriminating ability over samples of the character set they are expected to recognize. An executive routine is used to apply these subroutines to select a complete logic with a given performance and complexity. This logic consists of 39 to 96 AND gates connected to a shift register and a table look-up or resistance network comparison system. \n \nThe methods were applied to the design of recognitionl ogics for the 52 upper and lower case characters of IBM Electric Modern Pica type font and lower case Cyrillic characters scanned from Russian text. In both cases when the logics were tested on data different from that used to design the logics, the substitution rate was about one error per thousand. A single logic was designed to read two different Cyrillic fonts. For this design, an error rate of one error per hundred characters was observed. \n \nSeveral experiments are reported ona number of logics designed for typewritten data, and single- and two-font Cyrillic data.

A simplified recognition problem is considered involving the identification of any one of 12 letters when it is superimposed on an m \u00d7 n matrix. Translation, stretching, and compression of the letter are permitted. It is shown that the number of threshold gates required increases linearly as do the dimensions of the matrix with about 300 gates being necessary for a 20 \u00d7 20. On such a matrix, several hundred thousand configurations of the 12 letters can be correctly identified with each pattern being insensitive to varying degrees of \"noise.\" A threshold gate having the necessary fan power for this application is described together with its implementation in a small experimental model. Extensions of the methods to include rotation and magnification are discussed."

The main objective of the analysis is to compare the performance obtainable when optimum two-dimensional processing of the data is used and the performance obtainable when only one-dimensional (along the lines) processing is used. Optimization under the constraint that only processing along the lines is available is a new and interesting problem in optimum filter theory, and the results are of practical importance since in most systems this constraint is imposed. Since it is possible to modify the systems to accommodate arbitrary two-dimensional processing at the expense of some system complexity, it is important to determine the corresponding performance improvement. The emphasis is on the general theory, and many special cases deserve quantitative treatment. In this paper quantitative comparisons are made for two cases; specifically, top hat and cone-shaped frequency responses of the aperture are considered. These characteristics occur in coherent and incoherent scanners in which the \u201cresolution\u201d is limited by the optical aperture of the scanner. Three performance criteria are used: least-squares error, maximum-peak signal to rms noise ratio, and minimum system resolution. Table I shows the improvement of arbitrary two-dimensional filtering over one-dimensional filtering along the lines."

Recognition of handwritten arabic numerals requires sufficient system flexibility to cope with both unlimited variations in character shape and a large number of writing instruments. This flexibility has been achieved by combining the use of a stored recognition table and a hardware microprogram. The recognition logic obtained by computer simulation is immediately stored in the core memory as a table. The numerals are recognized by extracting a sequence of the geometrical features in horizontal zones of the character after normalization of the height of the character and the width of the strokes. The use of sequential recognition logic helps reduce the capacity of core memory required to obtain the desired high rate of recognition. The correct recognition rate of a single digit for a large sample of letters averaged 95 percent. For a three-digit sorting with 13 stackers the sorter incorrectly recognized approximately 0.1 percent, a rate of error consistent with manual sorting."

The coherently illuminated input distributions are spatially separated at the front focal plane of a spherical lens so that the spatial Fourier transforms are detected with a relative phase shift between the two transforms that are a linear function of the coordinates of the transform plane. The result is that the detection is sensitive to both amplitude and relative phase of the two Fourier transforms. This technique is used to operate directly on transparencies of interest and the result is displayed on a cathode-ray tube. Spatial distributions may be compared for differences or a distribution may be interrogated for images of a particular shape."

In this technique, a coherent optical system interferometrically generates a signal suitable for recording on the medium being tested. A second coherent optical system is used to obtain the MTF; spatial filters are used to remove the effects of film-grain noise, phase errors in the emulsion of the film, and extraneous light distributions. Since both systems are coherent, this technique can be used equally well to measure the MTF of phase-modulated media or bleached photographic film. A satisfying feature of this technique is that the MTF is displayed at the output of the second optical system as an easily detectable light distribution."

In spite of many serious mechanical perception of microscopic fields with a reliability that would inspire routine application still eludes us. Many facets of the problem appear to be well within the grasp of presentday technology. Thus, available histochemical techniques make it possible to prepare biological materials so that morphological integrity is preserved, key constituents are stained stoichiometrically, and the specimens are favorably dispersed for effective imaging one by one. Scanning microscopes now have the requisite sensitivity, resolution, and stability to sample such objects and make photometric measurements over a wide range of magnifications and wavelengths within the visible and near-visible spectrum. Furthermore, modern large capacity, high speed data facilities at last provide the ability to manipulate the hitherto unmanageable quantities of optical information contained within all but the simplest images. With the basic materials for achieving automation via mensuration finally a t hand, attention has been turned toward generating and evaluating methods for extracting meaning from quantitative optical information. Definitive concepts for image structuring and image characterization have yet to be realized, to be given satisfactory operational definitions, and to be assembled within a machine-oriented perceptual framework.6 Criteria for effective and efficient discrimination and interpretation of images must be evolved. It would be a serious mistake to presuppose that mechanical perception must mimic the human\u2019s perceptual apparatus in organizing images as complexes of picture eIements. Likewise i t would be serious to ignore traditional descriptive morphology and established taxonomies. In steering a middle course, the exploration of many complementary approaches and the introduction of numeric methods which fully utilize measurements of light intensity of optical density seemed to us to hold the most promise for augmenting and explicating the existing, largely verbal tradition of microscopic morphology. To realize these objectives, we have designed a system with three basic components: 1) a sensor which rigorously and effectively scans microscopic fields and converts the optical information into digital form; 2) human analysts who contribute heuristics, devise image processing methods and en-"

This pattern recognition technique is extremely efficient in handwritten character recognition, which is used for illustration in this paper. Because each input pattern is processed with all the pattern classes simultaneously, the speed of this pattern recognition technique is very high. It is found that most input patterns are recognized within first comparison process and no input patterns require more than two comparison processes for their recognition."

In this paper the performance of a matched filtering system is related to the degree of displacement for both uniform and nonuniform noise spectral densities. Static displacements of the filter normal or parallel to the optical axis are treated, as well as random motion of the filter normal to the optical axis. Displacements normal to the optical axis cause the performance to decrease more rapidly than those parallel to the axis. For both kinds, the positioning tolerances are more critical when the noise spectral density is nonuniform. A dual frequency-plane optical precessor is described; this processor helps overcome the tolerance problem when the noise is nonuniform because the fixed part of the matched filter can be placed in one frequency plane and the changeable part in another."

Random-dot images of black and white dots with various area fractions and tesselations (square and triangular lattices) were used as stimuli. The constructs of random geometry are correlation functions of n-th order and some functionals defined on them. The only parameter which is independent of the tesselation used is the first-order correlation which is the area fraction. It was first conjectured and then experimentally verified that figure-ground perception is not affected by the various tesselations used. Thus, figure-ground phenomena depend only on the area fraction of the white and black dots in the stimulus. There is a perceptual bias for white, that is, figure-ground reversal is easiest at 40 percent white-black area fraction. It was also experimentally shown that size-constancy prevails in figure-ground perception, but brightness-constancy does not."

Any absolute limit to the resolving power of an optical system must be based upon the existence of ambiguous images rather than on an arbitrary specification of the precision of image measurement, since precision can always be improved, even at the photon-counting limit. It is shown that for all objects of finite angular size, the image spectrum within the passband of the optical system contains the information necessary to determine the object spectrum throughout the entire frequency domain. Knowledge of the object spectrum implies knowledge of the object. It is shown that two distinctly different objects of finite size cannot have identical images, so that no ambiguous image exists for such objects. Therefore, diffraction limits resolving power in the sense of only the lack of precision of image measurement imposed by the system noise. Equations are derived which describe processing procedures by means of which object detail can be extracted from diffraction images. An illustrative example shows the successful processing of the image of two monochromatic point sources separated by 0.2 of the Rayleigh criterion distance."

For binary decisions in the presence of Gaussian noise, the probability of a correct decision is determined by the quadratic content of the difference image and the noise variance per unit of area. In the spatial frequency domain the probability of correct decision involves the integral of the power spectrum of the difference image and the noise variance per unit of area. The merit of a particular optical system for the performance of a specific binary decision task may be evaluated by use of a formula involving its modulation transfer function. The resolution of two monochromatic, incoherent point sources under conditions of high background radiation is discussed, as an illustrative example. The resolution of two point sources is limited only by the precision with which the flux density at all points in the image plane can be determined. The manner in which this increased precision can be obtained by increasing the period of observation is discussed, for the case of a photon-counting detector."

The phase index of modulation must be less than 0.2 rad to prevent intermodulation noise if a square-law detector is used. Phase holograms satisfy this requirement and, with care, so do spatial filters. In spatial filtering, however, an intolerable amount of distortion is introduced because the upper range of intensity levels of the fringe subcarrier exceeds the dynamic range of the recorder-modulator (photographic plates in this study). The impulse responses of spatial phase modulation filters show the effects of this distortion. Filters using spatial amplitude modulation have the same distortion but it is reduced because of the increasing opacity of the film in the overexposed regions. Simple blocking of the regions producing distortions effectively reduces the noise in the impulse response of the filter."

A diffuse, broadband light source is used to illuminate two transparencies that represent functions of differing scale factors. The transparencies are placed so that the light passing through both forms a pattern in a third position; this pattern represents the correlation of the func\u00ad tions. Robertson first used lensless correlography for obtaining the Patterson function for crystal lattices. Soon afterward, Bragg introduced a lens into the system so that, with identical scale factors in the two transparencies, the correlation function occurred in the focal plane of the lens. Meyer-Eppler proposed the lensless technique for noncrystallographic patterns. McLachlan demonstrated the application of lensless correlography to pattern recognition, and recently Wilde has demonstrated its applica\u00ad bility to many data forms. As the basis for lensless correlog\u00ad raphy is well-documented in the above references, it will not be repeated here. The simple expedient of imaging one of the transparencies allows the plane in which the correlation function occurs to be used for spatial filtering. This is directly analogous to conven\u00ad tional spatial filtering, in which the Fourier transform of the ob\u00ad ject occurs between the object and its image. Thus spatial filters can be used in the same manner as in conventional spatial filtering, and correlation function filtering of binary and variable density functions has been performed with good results. The Bragg configuration, shown above a bracket in Fig. 1, is used to obtain the correlation function \u03a6\u0391\u0392 in the focal plane of"

The rule of operation of the categorizer is called the ``recognition function.'' The optimization of the recognition function is discussed, and the form of the optimal function is derived. In practice, a prohibitively large sample is required to provide a basis for estimating the optimal recognition function. If, however, certain assumptions about the probability distributions of the measurements are warranted, recognition functions that are asymptotically optimal may be obtained readily. A small numerical example, involving the recognition of the hand-printed characters A, B, and C is solved by means of the techiques described. The recognition accuracy is found to be 95 per cent."

The transform of the record presents data in a reference frame that simplifies the problem of identifying and locating differences between the two input distributions. The process of transforming, detecting, and retransforming is a method of convolving the two input distributions. If the inputs are identical, the autocorrelation function is derived. If only real functions are evaluated, the autocorrelation function is symmetrical about the correlation peak. An asymmetry indicates a difference between the inputs, i.e., a cross-correlation function. The value of the technique is that it reduces the procedure for comparing spatial distributions to a search for asymmetry about an easily defined point. The same process may be used to identify spatial distributions by heterodyning a reference distribution with the field of view to be searched. The cross correlation function derived contains a sharp correlation peak for each target within the field of view."

                "text": "xThe ideas of information theory are at present stimulating many different areas of psychological inquiry. In providing techniques for quantifying situations which have hitherto been difficult or impossible to quantify, they suggest new and more precise ways of conceptualizing these situations (see Miller [12] for a general discussion and bibliography). Events ordered in time are particularly amenable to informational analysis; thus language sequences are being extensively studied, and other sequences, such as those of music, plainly invite research. In this paper I shall indicate some of the ways in which the concepts and techniques of information theory may clarify our understanding of visual perception. When we begin to consider perception as an information-handling process, it quickly becomes clear that much of the information received by any higher organism is redundant. Sensory events are highly interdependent in both space and time: if we know at a given moment the states of a limited number of receptors (i.e., whether they are firing or not firing), we can make better-than-chance inferences with respect to the prior and subsequent states of these receptors, and also with respect to the present, prior, and subsequent states of other receptors. The preceding statement, taken in its broadest im1 The experimental work for this study was performed as part of the United States Air Force Human Resources Research and Development Program.

In the present discussion, however, we shall restrict our attention to special types of lawfulness which may exist in space at a fixed time, and which seem particularly relevant to processes of visual perception."

The information efficiency is the information capacity divided by the number of photons that are needed to achieve the capacity, and is measured in bits per photon. The photographic films are discussed in separate sections from two points of view: that of maximizing the information capacity in bits/cm2, and that of maximizing the information efficiency. The other detectors and the beam of light are discussed only from the point of view of maximizing the information efficiency, because there is no upper bound to the information capacity that is related to practical use. The paper is primarily a review of the results of four previously published papers, but some new material is included: The results in Tables I and II on the information capacity of a beam of light are more extensive and more accurate than those previously published, and an explicit proof is given for the fact that it is not necessary to employ a radiation signal having spatial structure to obtain the greatest information efficiency with an image-transducing detector; a time varying radiation signal incident at a single point of the responsive surface is sufficient to achieve the maximum possible information efficiency."

Each of these simulated machines has read documents containing rows of handwritten Arabic numbers. Sample numbers were produced by at least 20 people for each simulation study. The three machines simulated differ in the control required of the writer during document preparation and in the complexity of the machines. Writing controls were required for the preparation of the first two types of documents. A section of this paper concerns experiments with and a mathematical model of controlled writing. The third simulated machine was applied both to numbers written within preprinted boxes and to numbers written without any guide marks. About one per cent of 2180 of these numbers were misread as the wrong character. This error rate is based on a sequential experiment in which the recognition logic is constructed from all characters not recognized and thus rejected prior to each input character. Numbers, when rejected, cause the programn to identify them from a table. Their structure is then entered into the recognition logic. The rejection rate decreased throughout the experiment. The last rejection rate was about 10 per cent."

As buildingblocks for this model will serve certain simple but foundamental concepts: signs, configurations, and images. These are related by similarity, synonymity and deformation transformations. Using these concepts it is shown how patterns can be analysed into elementary parts, both pure patterns and deformed ones. As a result of such an analysis one gets a grammatical description of the image presented to the observer. For didactic reasons the grammatical construction is limited to a special but typical case; a more general grammer of patterns will be treated elsewhere. The introduction of the mathematical model is accompanied by a number of illustrative examples."

                "text": "The advent of high energy particle accelerators and liquid bubble chamber detectors has added the demands of high speed data reduction to the many problems of modern nuclear physics research. For example, one six-month experiment on the University of California 72-inch Hydrogen Bubble Chamber yields photographic records of millions of nuclear events. This paper discusses one of the new measuring and topological identification devices which has been developed to analyze these great volumes of research data.\n Dr. Bruce McCormick has proposed a scanning technique which allows rapid recognition, separation and measurement of the photographic records of star type nuclear events. A device known as the Spiral Reader measures background and star type event features impartially, discriminating against non-radial patterns by the geometry of its rotating scanning element. The event measurements are separated from the background measurements by an IBM 704 computer under the direction of a program called FILTER. The separated nuclear event measurements are subsequently reconstructed in space for physics analysis.\n FILTER exploits the observation that if a segment of a circular arc is rotated about a point on that arc, intercepts occur at regular intervals along a radius to the point at constant angular intervals of the rotation azimuth. The Spiral Reader, by placing the burden of event discrimination on a high speed digital computer, minimizes the need for either special analysis equipment or for a human operator to make the topological separation. Simulation, calibration and cathode ray tube display routines have been included in the filter system.\n This paper describes the computer program FILTER which separates the topological star-type event configurations from undesired background features."

The kinds of puzzles and their properties are discussed in detail.

In statistical recognition systems, pattern information is stored in the machine in the form of pattern characteristics with statistics relating the characteristics to the patterns. If the number of characteristics a system can process is limited, and if the system designer, while able to conceive of a large number of relevant characteristics, does not know which are the most important, then an experimental selection of these characteristics is required. As tools, the designer may have at his disposal a large computer, a large sample of the patterns to be recognized, and a set of programs to measure the characteristics. Thus, he can compare certain statistics relating the patterns to the characteristics. The problem is: what statistics should he calculate in order to select the best characteristics? Assuming the characteristics to be independent in their effect on the decision, this paper examines the notion of a single number statistic for each characteristic which would have certain desirable properties related to the \"goodness\" of the characteristic. It is shown that, in general, no such statistic exists. However, a statistic is proposed which, while not having these properties in general, at least has them in a wide range of situations. An experimental study of the validity of this choice is reported together with the design of a letter recognition system. Using a sample of 15 complete 62 symbol alphabets, 13 characteristics were selected. The resulting system recognized correctly 81.9% of the letters presented to it."

Under the microscope the chromosomes are visible as dark structures approximately one micron to eight micron in overall length and less than one micron in width.' Cells of gormal persons contain 22 pairs of autosomesand one pair of sex chromosomes classifiable by group and number. Consistent chromosome abnormalities are found to occur in association with specific congenital disorder^.^ The two types of observed chromosomal aberrations are: (a) chromosome complements with abnormal numbers of chromosomes, and (b) disturbances in the structure of the chromosome rather than in number. In addition to congenital defects chromosome abnormalities are reported in persons with a diagnosis of ~ancer ' l -~ and chromosome damage is found in individuals after irradiati~n.'.~ Chemical mutagens as well have produced chromosome spreads with aberrations.'\"'\" Less is known about chromosomal variations in the general population. Due in part to the time-consuming work involved in karyotyping the chromosome spreads, only about 100 cases can be analyzed in one year by a laboratory having a senior scientist and a highly trained technician. This rate is not only insufficient to meet existing demands for clinical evaluation, but quite inadequate for large-scale studies of radiation induced chromosome damage particularly at low dosage levels, or for the investigation of specific chromosome polymorphism in populations. Computer techniques of pattern recognition appeared to be of value for the specific task of chromosome analysis.

The theory of how test results should be combined to yield an optimal assignment has been discussed in an earlier paper. Here, attention is focused on the tests themselves. At present, we usually measure the effectiveness of a set of tests empirically, i.e., by determining the percentage of correct recognitions made by some recognition device which uses these tests. In this paper, we discuss some of the theoretical problems encountered in trying to determine a more formal measure of the effectiveness of a set of tests; a measure which might be a practical substitute for the empirical evaluation. Specifically, the following question is considered: What constitutes an effective set of tests, and how is this effectiveness dependent on the correlations among, and the properties of, the individual tests in the set? Specific suggestions are considered for the case in which the test results are normally distributed, but arbitrarily correlated. The discussion is supported by the results of experiments dealing with automatic recognition of hand-printed characters."

Each member of this class of problems consists of a set of labeled line drawings. The task to be performed can be concisely described by the question: 'figure A is to figure B as figure C is to which of the given answer figures?' For example, given the problem illustrated as Fig. 1, the geometric-analogy program (which we shall subsequently call ANALOGY, for brevity) selected the problem figure labeled 4 as its answer. It seems safe to say that most people would agree with ANALOGY's answer to this problem (which, incidentally, is taken from the 1942 edition of the Psychological Test for College Freshmen of the American Council on Education). Furthermore, if one were required to make explicit the reasoning by which he arrived at his answer, prospects are good that the results would correspond closely to the description of its 'reasoning' produced by ANALOGY."

The \"schedule,\" on the other hand, is the numerical means by which practical cases can be rapidly and systematically solved. Besides revealing the redundancies in a given set, both the \"mobile\" and the \"schedule\" may serve as useful tools in evaluating and designing sampling programs."

In 1960, Subcommittee 30.4 on Methods of Measurement of Noise of the IRE Audio and Electroacoustics Committee (Technical Committee 30) became concerned with the characterization and measurement of quantities having a short duration. The subject of this special issue, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), is a technique that substantially reduces the time required to perform Fourier analysis on a computer. The first paper, was prepared by members of the Concepts Subcommittee (formerly 30.4) as a general survey of the subject. The second paper, is the keynote paper presented by C. Bingham, Jr., at the Power Spectrum Workshop. Short contributions prepared by four of the workshop panelists follow the keynote paper. Each panelist was at liberty to submit his contribution as an informal discussion or as a formal paper. These short contributions are followed by \"Historical Notes on the Fast Fourier Transform,\" by J.W. Cooley, P.A.W. Lewis, and P.D. Welch. The remainder of the special issue is given to five papers on applications of the Fast Fourier Transform. These papers discuss mathematical developments as well as experimental results obtained by use of the Fast Fourier Transform for the solution of engineering problems."

Extending a known result (A is convex iff S = phi iff D = phi) one can prove: different sets have the same skeletal pair iff they have the same convex deficiency. Several other results are presented concerning the correspondence A approaching (S,q) and the properties of S and q. The relevance of these notions and theorems for a mathematical model of visual perception is emphasized. (Author)"

Complex visual objects are not only harder to reproduce from memory than simple ones (4, 6), but also harder to learn by name (4, 7) and to match (11). Complexity is an ill-defined variable, however. No two of the experiments referenced above employ exactly the same operations of physical measurement , and an essential communality between them is not easy to specify in objective terms. In the study reported here, ratings of the complexity of nonrepresenta-tional shapes were obtained from a large number of Ss and related to measurable physical characteristics of the shapes. The results not only have interest in their own right, but also serve to indicate the physical variables most likely to be relevant to other tasks, like those initially mentioned , on which data are typically harder to get and less precise. The relationship of judged complexity to informational content, \"degrees of freedom,\" compactness, and certain other variables will be considered. METHOD Materials.-\u2014The stimuli were 72 \"random\" shapes, each constructed by the following general method. In a k X k matrix, n random points were plotted, i.e., all coordinates of the points were random numbers between 1 and k. The points were then connected randomly into a polygon of n sides. This connecting process involved two steps. First, peripheral points were connected into a convex polygon which enclosed all the points not included in its contour (as if a pin were stuck into each point and a rubber band snapped around the whole cluster). Second, the unconnected points were given a random order and each in turn was \"taken into\" a randomly chosen segment of the surrounding polygon (as if by hooking that segment of the rubber band over the interior pin). Since lines connecting the points were not permitted to cross, the number of alternative segments into which a given point might be taken could either increase or decrease as the process continued; hence the assignment of a random sequence to the unconnected points. Connections which placed certain points outside the polygon were permitted, though in consequence the ways in which such points could themselves be connected were restricted. Some of the polygons thus constructed were further developed into curved figures by replacing angles with inscribed arcs of random 221"

                "text": "Gibson and Gibson (1955a) have offered the hypothesis that there is a perfect correspondence between variations in perceptual responses and variations in the physical properties of stimuli. They have suggested that perceptual learning consists of responding to variables of physical stimulation not previously responded to and, consequently, that there is some set of physical characteristics which uniquely determines every response. For such an hypothesis to be adequately tested it is necessary to know exactly what physical properties of the stimulus are the determinants of any given discriminatory response, but the problem of discovering these stimulus properties still awaits systematic treatment. One possible approach to the problem is by way of phenomenological analysis of the percept. This was the method which produced the classic set of \"gestalt properties\" of forms. It should be noted, however, that although these gestalt properties are ascribed to the stimulus, they are actually the results of a judgmental process, and their specification in terms of physical operations has never been completely accomplished. This latter requirement is met by the standard psychophysical methods, but these methods were developed originally in unidimensional cases and have not as yet been too successful in accounting for responses which are determined interactively by several physical dimensions of the stimulus. Attneave (1957) has shown a way of handling the multidimensional case by using a multiple correlation technique. H e had a large number of Ss judge nonsense forms in terms of their Complexity. H e then correlated a number of selected physical characteristics of the forms (number of sides, perimeter, area, etc.) with the judgments and combined the most relevant physical variables in a multiple correlation. He was able to account for slightly more than 90% of the total variance associated with the judgments by this technique. A subsequent experiment by Elliott (1958) established that these results could be duplicated despite changes in the subject population (Air Force officers vs. enlisted men), changes in the stimulus sample, and changes in the"

The first mechanism averages an apparition over a group, and in the treatment of this mechanism it is suggested that scansion plays a significant part. The second mechanism reduces an apparition to a standard selected from among its many legitimate presentations. The former mechanism is exemplified by the recognition of chords regardless of pitch and shapes regardless of size. The latter is exemplified here only in the reflexive mechanism translating apparitions to the fovea.

The fact that the incidence of this type of white cell is of the order of one per each million blood cells makes practical use of this index by the human observer essentially impossible. The Atomic Energy Commission has therefore arranged for the construction of a blood cell scanning system with which to determine the feasibility of the semi-automatic identification of the binucleate lymphobyte in glass-mounted smears of human blood.\n The CELLSCAN system consists of a closed circuit television microscope coupled to a special purpose digital computer. The system produces a quantized image of the leucocyte whose pattern is to be analyzed. The computer program causes the quantized image to be operated upon serially in such a way that groupings of contiguous binary \"1's\" are reduced to single 1's. Sampling the number of isolated 1's at various instants during the reduction process produces a histogram of the leucocyte's various constituent parts. The CELLSCAN system is intended to determine whether the resultant histogram of the binucleate lymphocyte is unique in the histogram population of all leucocytes."

Some methods may involve retaining as much information as possible throughout the process until the final classification is accomplished. Suggested here is a concept of pre-organization of information by \"property filtration\" which reduces the information as near the source within the automata as is feasible with respect to the over-all system compatibility. \"Property filtration\" is explained and illustrated by describing two practical and several theoretical property filters. The results of this work to date indicate that this approach to data reduction and pattern identification may greatly simplify the ultimate construction of adaptive automata, if such property filters are used as functional input units."

The matrix yields information about a patterm mapped on its cells by reporting whether or not a threshold exceeds the number of cells that remain in a ``zero'' state after a sequence of operations that include directed cell-to-cell propagations of change of state. The pattern furnishes a barrier to the propagations. The testing process is a program written to suit some alphabet of pattern classes. An automatic sequencer for controlling the testing process is described. The testing operations are few, but they can be combined in tests for an abundance of features of great variety. A computer simulation, using a single decision tree, classifies the commonest press and typewriter fonts. A small manually sequenced model employing integrated microelectronic cells has been built."

This model may now be tested against the specification and will generally be modified iteratively until the design goal is achieved, in this case a layout with the required characteristics. It may also be that the design problem is being tackled by a team, in which case several users of the design system may wish to access and transform the model, for instance to display views and projections of it, or check on how it interfaces with a parallel project.\n The rest of this paper is concerned with the basic requirements of the data structure package, and with a survey of those packages which have been implemented and about which information is available."

The adequacy of the model is checked by comparing estimated readability with observed readability for two sets of data, one with high variability and one with low variability. The Browning-Bledsoe recognition scheme is also treated as a coding and decoding problem in which case the concepts of information theory are useful. Finally, brief mention is made of the connection between pattern recognition problems and classification problems in general, and the Browning-Bledsoe recognition scheme is compared and contrasted with other recognition schemes which make use of measurements on patterns."

Operators are generated and refined by the program itself as a function of the problem space and of its own successes and failures in dealing with the problem space. Not only does the program learn information about different patterns, it also learns or constructs, in part at least, a secondary code appropriate for the analysis of the particular set of patterns input to it."

The English-like questions all pertain to simple diagrams built of elementary figures with relations like 'above' and 'larger than.' The input to the program into which the algorithm presented here could be implemented are questions such as 'Is it true that in Fig. 1 each triangle is above a circle,' and may include terms like 'how,' 'when,' 'what,' in an interesting variety of interrogative sentence types. The output of the program is a flow diagram for another program to answer the question by inference and search of a structured data base in which representations of diagrams are stored. The English-like source language of questions that the algorithm can process, though restricted and fixed in syntax and domain of discourse, has a potentially wide scope in that it includes some of the fundamental question types."

                "text": "S HAPE has always been of concern in geography. Indeed, many geographical features such as deltas, oxbow lakes, and island chains are named from their distinctive shapes or forms, and shape has been found to be extremely useful for describing towns, trade areas, and political units. Although shape has been primarily used in geography as a descriptive device, it has also been of value as an analytical tool. But it is in the related disciplines, such as the biological sciences and mineralogy, that shape has been productive of theories.' However, lack of adequate methods for measuring shape has restricted its widespread use. Two methods of measurement have now been developed and are presented here, together with a review of some of the more pertinent articles concerned with shape or form and an example of the application of shape in urban geography. It is hoped that the study will lead to further applications of shape in solving gogeraphical problems."
