This paper first introduces a simple principle for reducing the descriptions of event sequences without loss of information. A consequence of this principle is that only unexpected inputs can be relevant. This insight leads to the construction of neural architectures that learn to divide and conquer by recursively decomposing sequences. I describe two architectures. The first functions as a self-organizing multilevel hierarchy of recurrent networks. The second, involving only two recurrent networks, tries to collapse a multilevel predictor hierarchy into a single recurrent net. Experiments show that the system can require less computation per time step and many fewer training sequences than conventional training algorithms for recurrent nets."

The principle of history compression 18] provides a means of transforming long sequences with redundant information into equivalent shorter sequences; the shorter sequences are more easily manipulated and learned by neural networks. The principle states that expected sequence elements can be removed from the sequence to form an equivalent, more compact sequence without loss of information. The principle was embodied in a neural net predictive architecture that attempted to anticipate the next element of a sequence given the previous elements. If the prediction was accurate, the next element was discarded; otherwise, it was passed on to a second network that processed the sequence in some fashion (e.g., recognition, classiication, autoencoding, etc.). As originally proposed, a binary judgement was made as to the predictability of each element. Here, we describe a contininuous version of history compression in which elements are discarded in a graded fashion dependent on their predictability, embodied by their (Shannon) information. We implement continuous history compression using a RAAM architecture, yielding a class of sequence learning algorithms that are both entirely local and still able to bridge long time lags between correlated events."

One basic idea is to train an adaptive predictor module to predict future events from past events, and to train an additional condence module to model the reliability of the predictor's predictions. We select system states at those points in time where there are changes in prediction reliability, and use them recur-sively as inputs for higher-level predictors. This can be benecial for\u00e0daptive sub-goal generation' as well as for`conventional' goal-directed (supervised and reinforcement) learning: Systems based on these design principles were successfully tested on tasks where conventional training algorithms for recurrent nets fail. Finally we describe the principles of the rst neural sequenc\u00e8chunker' which collapses a self-organizing multi-level predictor hierarchy into a single recurrent network. This paper is based on th\u00e8principle of reduced history description': As long as an adaptive sequence processing dynamic system is able to predict future environmental inputs from previous ones, no additional knowledge can be obtained by observing these inputs in reality. Only unpredicted inputs deserve attention ([7][4][9]). This paper demonstrates that it can be very ecient to focus on unexpected inputs and ignore expected ones. First we motivate this work by describing a major problem of`conventional' learning algorithms for time-varying inputs, namely, the problem of long time lags between relevant inputs. Then we introduce a principle for unsupervised detection of causal chains in streams of input events. Short representations of`presumed causal chains' recursively serve as inputs for`higher-level' detec"

Although variants of back propagation can in principle be used to find structure in sequences, in practice they are not sufficiently powerful to discover arbitrary contingencies, especially those spanning long temporal intervals or involving high order statistics. For example, in designing a connectionist network for music composition, we have encountered the problem that the net is able to learn musical structure that occurs locally in time--e.g., relations among notes within a musical phrase--but not structure that occurs over longer time periods--e.g., relations among phrases. To address this problem, we require a means of constructing a reduced description of the sequence that makes global aspects more explicit or more readily detectable. I propose to achieve this using hidden units that operate with different time constants. Simulation experiments indicate that slower time-scale hidden units are able to pick up global structure, structure that simply can not be learned by standard back propagation."

These algorithms either are not local in time or not local in space. Those algorithms which are local in both time and space usually cannot deal sensibly with \u2018hidden units\u2019. In contrast, as far as we can judge, learning rules in biological systems with many \u2018hidden units\u2019 are local in both space and time. In this paper we propose a parallel on-line learning algorithms which performs local computations only, yet still is designed to deal with hidden units and with units whose past activations are \u2018hidden in time\u2019. The approach is inspired by Holland's idea of the bucket brigade for classifier systems, which is transformed to run on a neural network with fixed topology. The result is a feedforward or recurrent \u2018neural\u2019 dissipative system which is consuming \u2018weight-substance\u2019 and permanently trying to distribute this substance onto its connections in an ap..."

This algorithm allows a network to learn specified trajectories in state space in response to various input sequences. The network dynamics are described by a system of coupled differential equations that specify the continuous change of the unit activities and weights over time. The algorithm is nonlocal, in that a change in the connection weight between two units may depend on the values for some of the weights between different units. However, the operation of a learned network (fixed weights) is local. If the network units are specified to behave like electronic amplifiers, then an analog implementation of the learned network is straightforward. An example demonstrates the use of the algorithm in a completely connected network of four units. The network creates a limit cycle attractor in order to perform the specified task.<<ETX>>"

One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction."

A method for accomplishing this is presented which buffers a small number of past actions based on the unpredictability of or attention to each as it occurs. This approach allows for the buffer size to be small, and yet learning can reach indefinitely far back into the past; it also allows the system to learn when reinforcement is not only delayed but also reinforcements from other unrelated actions may arrive during this delay. An example of a simulated food-finding creature is used to show the system at work in a predictive application where reinforcements show this interleaving behaviour."

To a considerable extent the continuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discrete case by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but finite number of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved on a discrete basis. As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters in general approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case. There are, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change of emphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results to particular cases."
