For computational reasons the set is also (e) orthogonal and lends itself to (f) rapid computation. The systems are derived from concepts in matrix algebra, but are closely connected to decompositions based on quadrature mirror filters. Our computations take place hierarchically, leading to a pyramid representation in which all of the basis functions have the same basic shape, and appear at many scales. By placing the high-pass and low-pass kernels on staggered grids, we can derived odd-tap QMF kernels that are quite compact. We have developed pyramids using separable, quincunx, and hexagonal kernels. Image data compression with the pyramids gives excellent results, both in terms of MSE and visual appearance. A non-orthogonal variant allows good performance with 3-tap basis kernels and the appropriate inverse sampling kernels."

The properties of the operator which approximates a signal at a given resolution were studied. It is shown that the difference of information between the approximation of a signal at the resolutions 2/sup j+1/ and 2/sup j/ (where j is an integer) can be extracted by decomposing this signal on a wavelet orthonormal basis of L/sup 2/(R/sup n/), the vector space of measurable, square-integrable n-dimensional functions. In L/sup 2/(R), a wavelet orthonormal basis is a family of functions which is built by dilating and translating a unique function psi (x). This decomposition defines an orthogonal multiresolution representation called a wavelet representation. It is computed with a pyramidal algorithm based on convolutions with quadrature mirror filters. Wavelet representation lies between the spatial and Fourier domains. For images, the wavelet representation differentiates several spatial orientations. The application of this representation to data compression in image coding, texture discrimination and fractal analysis is discussed. >"

                "text": "Subband coding has become quite popular for the source encoding of speech. This paper presents a simple yet efficient extension of this concept to the source coding of images. We specify the constraints for a set of two-dimensional quadrature mirror filters (QMF's) for a particular frequency-domain partition, and show that these constraints are satisfied by a separable combination of one-dimensional QMF's. Bits are then optimally allocated among the subbands to minimize the mean-squared error for DPCM coding of the subbands. Also, an adaptive technique is developed to allocate the bits within each subband by means of a local variance mask. Optimum quantization is employed with quantizers matched to the Laplacian distribution. Subband coded images are presented along with their signal-to-noise ratios (SNR's). The SNR performance of the subband coder is compared to that of the adaptive discrete cosine transform (DCT), vector quantization, and differential vector quantization for bit rates of 0.67, 1.0, and 2.0 bits per pixel for 256 \u00d7 256 monochrome images. The adaptive subband coder has the best SNR performance."

The objectives of the present work, however, are not restricted to coding. The analysis part is designed so that it can also serve applications in the area of computer vision. Indeed, derivatives of Gaussians, which have found widespread application in feature detection over the past few years, play a central role in the Hermite analysis. It is also argued that the proposed processing scheme is in close agreement with current insight into the image processing that is carried out by the human visual system. In particular, it is demonstrated that the Hermite transform is in better agreement with human visual modeling than Gabor expansions. >"

The representation differs from established techniques in that the code elements are localized in spatial frequency as well as in space. Pixel-to-pixel correlations are first removed by subtracting a lowpass filtered copy of the image from the image itself. The result is a net data compression since the difference, or error, image has low variance and entropy, and the low-pass filtered image may represented at reduced sample density. Further data compression is achieved by quantizing the difference image. These steps are then repeated to compress the low-pass image. Iteration of the process at appropriately expanded scales generates a pyramid data structure. The encoding process is equivalent to sampling the image with Laplacian operators of many scales. Thus, the code tends to enhance salient image features. A further advantage of the present code is that it is well suited for many image analysis tasks as well as for image compression. Fast algorithms are described for coding and decoding."

                "text": "The data structure used to represent image information can be critical to the successful completion of an image processing task. One structure that has attracted considerable attention is the image pyramid This consists of a set of lowpass or bandpass copies of an image, each representing pattern information of a different scale. Here we describe a variety of pyramid methods that we have developed for image data compression, enhancement, analysis and graphics. \u00a91984 RCA Corporation Final manuscript received November 12, 1984 Reprint Re-29-6-5 that can perform most of the routine visual tasks that humans do effortlessly. It is becoming increasingly clear that the format used to represent image data can be as critical in image processing as the algorithms applied to the data. A digital image is initially encoded as an array of pixel intensities, but this raw format i s not suited to most tasks. Alternatively, an image may be represented by its Fourier transform, with operations applied to the transform coefficients rather than to the original pixel values. This is appropriate for some data compression and image enhancement tasks, but inappropriate for others. The transform representation is particularly unsuited for machine vision and computer graphics, where the spatial location of pattem elements is critical. Recently there has been a great deal of interest in representations that retain spatial localization as well as localization in the spatial\u2014frequency domain. This i s achieved by decomposing the image into a set of spatial frequency bandpass component images. Individual samples of a component image represent image pattern information that is appropriately localized, while the bandpassed image as a whole represents information about a particular fineness of detail or scale. There is evidence that the human visual system uses such a representation, and multiresolution schemes are becoming increasingly popular in machine vision and in image processing in general. The importance of analyzing images at many scales arises from the nature of images themselves. Scenes in the world contain objects of many sizes, and these objects contain features of many sizes. Moreover, objects can be at various distances from the viewer. As a result, any analysis procedure that is applied only at a single scale may miss information at other scales. The solution is to carry out analyses at all scales simultaneously. Convolution is the basic operation of most image analysis systems, and convolution with large weighting functions is a notoriously expensive computation. In a multiresolution system one wishes to perform convolutions with kernels of many sizes, ranging from very small to very large. and the computational problems appear forbidding. Therefore one of the main problems in working with multiresolution representations is to develop fast and efficient techniques. Members of the Advanced Image Processing Research Group have been actively involved in the development of multiresolution techniques for some time. Most of the work revolves around a representation known as a \"pyramid,\" which is versatile, convenient, and efficient to use. We have applied pyramid-based methods to some fundamental problems in image analysis, data compression, and image manipulation."

Most edge detection schemes ignore the composite nature of these edges, resulting in systematic errors in detection and localization. The problem of detecting and localizing these edges is addressed, along with the problem of false responses in smoothly shaded regions with constant gradient of the image brightness. A class of nonlinear filters, known as quadratic filters, is appropriate for this task, while linear filters are not. Performance criteria are derived for characterizing the SNR, localization and multiple responses of these filters in a manner analogous to Canny's criteria for linear filters. A two-dimensional version of the approach is developed which has the property of being able to represent multiple edges at the same location and determine the orientation of each to any desired precision. This permits junctions to be localized without rounding. Experimental results are presented.<<ETX>>"

A fundamental problem in computing such descriptions is scale: a derivative must be taken over some neighborhood, but there is seldom a principled basis for choosing its size. Scale-space filtering is a method that describes signals qualitatively, managing the ambiguity of scale in an organized and natural way. The signal is first expanded by convolution with gaussian masks over a continuum of sizes. This \"scale-space\" image is then collapsed, using its qualitative structure, into a tree providing a concise but complete qualitative description covering all scales of observation. The description is further refined by applying a stability criterion, to identify events that persist of large changes in scale."

In the present neural network approach, based on interlaminar interactions involving two layers with fixed weights and one layer with adjustable weights, the network finds coefficients for complete conjoint 2-D Gabor transforms without restrictive conditions. In wavelet expansions based on a biologically inspired log-polar ensemble of dilations, rotations, and translations of a single underlying 2-D Gabor wavelet template, image compression is illustrated with ratios up to 20:1. Also demonstrated is image segmentation based on the clustering of coefficients in the complete 2-D Gabor transform. >"

The theoretical lower limit for the joint entropy, or uncertainty, of these variables is achieved by an optimal 2D filter family whose spatial weighting functions are generated by exponentiated bivariate second-order polynomials with complex coefficients, the elliptic generalization of the one-dimensional elementary functions proposed in Gabor's famous theory of communication [J. Inst. Electr. Eng. 93, 429 (1946)]. The set includes filters with various orientation bandwidths, spatial-frequency bandwidths, and spatial dimensions, favoring the extraction of various kinds of information from an image. Each such filter occupies an irreducible quantal volume (corresponding to an independent datum) in a four-dimensional information hyperspace whose axes are interpretable as 2D visual space, orientation, and spatial frequency, and thus such a filter set could subserve an optimally efficient sampling of these variables. Evidence is presented that the 2D receptive-field profiles of simple cells in mammalian visual cortex are well described by members of this optimal 2D filter family, and thus such visual neurons could be said to optimize the general uncertainty relations for joint 2D-spatial-2D-spectral information resolution. The variety of their receptive-field dimensions and orientation and spatial-frequency bandwidths, and the correlations among these, reveal several underlying constraints, particularly in width/length aspect ratio and principal axis organization, suggesting a polar division of labor in occupying the quantal volumes of information hyperspace.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The estimator is shown to be a nonstationary linear combination of three stationary estimators. The relation of the estimator to human visual physiology is discussed. A method for estimating the nonstationary control information is described and shown to be effective when the estimation is made from noisy data. A suboptimal approach which is computationally less demanding is presented and used in the restoration of a variety of images corrupted by additive white noise. The results show that the method can improve the quality of noisy images even when the signal-to-noise ratio is very low."

An efficient pyramid image coding system using quadrature mirror filters to form the image-pyramids is proposed in this paper. Characteristics of the image-pyramids are presented. Since the Laplacian pyramids of most nature images contain sparse and spatially concentrated data, a combined run-length coding for zero-valued elements and entropy coding for elements larger than a certain threshold is employed. The textural features in the Laplacian pyramids suggest that coding techniques pursuing spatial correlation may be advantageous. Therefore, vector quantization is chosen to code the Laplacian pyramids. Simulation results have shown that simple vector quantization accomplished significant bit-rate reduction over scalar quantization. The proposed system has also shown good-quality reproduction at bit rates lower than 1 bit/pixel."

Two of their main applications are subband coders for speech processing and transmultiplexers for telecommunications. Below, we derive a theoretical framework for the analysis, synthesis, and computational complexity of multirate filter banks. The use of matrix notation leads to basic results derived from properties of linear algebra. Using rank and determinant of filter matrices, it is shown how to obtain aliasing/ crosstalk-free reconstruction, and when perfect reconstruction is possible. The synthesis of filters for filter banks is also explored, three design methods are presented, and finally, the computational complexity is considered."

Use of QMF's enables to avoid the aliasing effects due to samples decimation when signal is split into sub-bands. Each sub-band is then coded independently with use of Block Companded PCM (BCPCM) quantizers. Then a variable number of bits is allocated to each sub-band quantizer in order to take advantage of the relative perceptual effect of the quantizing error. The paper is organized as follows: - First, splitting in two sub-bands with QMF's is analysed. -Then, a general description of a splitband voice coding scheme using QMF's is made. -Finally, two coding schemes are considered, operating respectively at 16 KBps and 32 KBps. Averaged values of S/N performances are given when encoding both male and female voices. Comparisons are made with conventional BCPCM and CCITT A-Law. Taped results will be played at the conference."

To solve these problems, we must be able to relate natural surfaces to their images; this requires a good model of natural surface shapes. Fractal functions are a good choice for modeling 3-D natural surfaces because 1) many physical processes produce a fractal surface shape, 2) fractals are widely used as a graphics tool for generating natural-looking shapes, and 3) a survey of natural imagery has shown that the 3-D fractal surface model, transformed by the image formation process, furnishes an accurate description of both textured and shaded image regions. The 3-D fractal model provides a characterization of 3-D surfaces and their images for which the appropriateness of the model is verifiable. Furthermore, this characterization is stable over transformations of scale and linear transforms of intensity. The 3-D fractal model has been successfully applied to the problems of 1) texture segmentation and classification, 2) estimation of 3-D shape information, and 3) distinguishing between perceptually ``smooth'' and perceptually ``textured'' surfaces in the scene."
