However, existing techniques restrict these properties to categorical labels (for example, a person is \u2018smiling\u2019 or not, a scene is \u2018dry\u2019 or not), and thus fail to capture more general semantic relationships. We propose to model relative attributes. Given training data stating how object/scene categories relate according to different attributes, we learn a ranking function per attribute. The learned ranking functions predict the relative strength of each property in novel images. We then build a generative model over the joint space of attribute ranking outputs, and propose a novel form of zero-shot learning in which the supervisor relates the unseen object category to previously seen objects via attributes (for example, \u2018bears are furrier than giraffes\u2019). We further show how the proposed relative attributes enable richer textual descriptions for new images, which in practice are more precise for human interpretation. We demonstrate the approach on datasets of faces and natural scenes, and show its clear advantages over traditional binary attribute prediction for these new tasks."

Moreover, these approaches also ignore the interdependencies among the query terms. In contrast, we propose a principled approach for multi-attribute retrieval which explicitly models the correlations that are present between the attributes. Given a multi-attribute query, we also utilize other attributes in the vocabulary which are not present in the query, for ranking/retrieval. Furthermore, we integrate ranking and retrieval within the same formulation, by posing them as structured prediction problems. Extensive experimental evaluation on the Labeled Faces in the Wild(LFW), FaceTracer and PASCAL VOC datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art ranking and retrieval methods."

First, we show that retrieving images of particular objects based on attribute vectors gives results comparable to the state of the art. Second, we demonstrate that combining attribute and Fisher vectors improves performance for retrieval of particular objects as well as categories. Third, we implement an efficient coding technique for compressing the combined descriptor to very small codes. Experimental results on the Holidays dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms the state of the art, even for a very compact representation of 16 bytes per image. Retrieving category images is evaluated on the \u201cweb-queries\u201d dataset. We show that attribute features combined with Fisher vectors improve the performance and that combined image features can supplement text features."

We introduce an approach to define a vocabulary of attributes that is both human understandable and discriminative. The system takes object/scene-labeled images as input, and returns as output a set of attributes elicited from human annotators that distinguish the categories of interest. To ensure a compact vocabulary and efficient use of annotators' effort, we 1) show how to actively augment the vocabulary such that new attributes resolve inter-class confusions, and 2) propose a novel \"nameability\" manifold that prioritizes candidate attributes by their likelihood of being associated with a nameable property. We demonstrate the approach with multiple datasets, and show its clear advantages over baselines that lack a name-ability model or rely on a list of expert-provided attributes."

Attributes are visual qualities of objects, such as 'red', 'striped', or 'spotted'. The model sees attributes as patterns of image segments, repeatedly sharing some characteristic properties. These can be any combination of appearance, shape, or the layout of segments within the pattern. Moreover, attributes with general appearance are taken into account, such as the pattern of alternation of any two colors which is characteristic for stripes. To enable learning from unsegmented training images, the model is learnt discriminatively, by optimizing a likelihood ratio. \n \nAs demonstrated in the experimental evaluation, our model can learn in a weakly supervised setting and encompasses a broad range of attributes. We show that attributes can be learnt starting from a text query to Google image search, and can then be used to recognize the attribute and determine its spatial extent in novel real-world images."

In order to scale the use of these describable visual attributes to a large number of categories, especially those not well studied by psychologists or linguists, it will be necessary to find alternative techniques for identifying attribute vocabularies and for learning to recognize attributes without hand labeled training data. We demonstrate that it is possible to accomplish both these tasks automatically by mining text and image data sampled from the Internet. The proposed approach also characterizes attributes according to their visual representation: global or local, and type: color, texture, or shape. This work focuses on discovering attributes and their visual appearance, and is as agnostic as possible about the textual description."

This setup has hardly been studied in computer vision research, but it is the rule rather than the exception, because the world contains tens of thousands of different object classes and for only a very few of them image, collections have been formed and annotated with suitable class labels. In this paper, we tackle the problem by introducing attribute-based classification. It performs object detection based on a human-specified high-level description of the target objects instead of training images. The description consists of arbitrary semantic attributes, like shape, color or even geographic information. Because such properties transcend the specific learning task at hand, they can be pre-learned, e.g. from image datasets unrelated to the current task. Afterwards, new classes can be detected based on their attribute representation, without the need for a new training phase. In order to evaluate our method and to facilitate research in this area, we have assembled a new large-scale dataset, \u201cAnimals with Attributes\u201d, of over 30,000 animal images that match the 50 classes in Osherson's classic table of how strongly humans associate 85 semantic attributes with animal classes. Our experiments show that by using an attribute layer it is indeed possible to build a learning object detection system that does not require any training images of the target classes."

Describable visual attributes are labels that can be given to an image to describe its appearance. This paper focuses on images of faces and the attributes used to describe them, although the concepts also apply to other domains. Examples of face attributes include gender, age, jaw shape, nose size, etc. The advantages of an attribute-based representation for vision tasks are manifold: They can be composed to create descriptions at various levels of specificity; they are generalizable, as they can be learned once and then applied to recognize new objects or categories without any further training; and they are efficient, possibly requiring exponentially fewer attributes (and training data) than explicitly naming each category. We show how one can create and label large data sets of real-world images to train classifiers which measure the presence, absence, or degree to which an attribute is expressed in images. These classifiers can then automatically label new images. We demonstrate the current effectiveness-and explore the future potential-of using attributes for face verification and image search via human and computational experiments. Finally, we introduce two new face data sets, named FaceTracer and PubFig, with labeled attributes and identities, respectively."

Doing so allows us not only to name familiar objects, but also: to report unusual aspects of a familiar object (\u201cspotty dog\u201d, not just \u201cdog\u201d); to say something about unfamiliar objects (\u201chairy and four-legged\u201d, not just \u201cunknown\u201d); and to learn how to recognize new objects with few or no visual examples. Rather than focusing on identity assignment, we make inferring attributes the core problem of recognition. These attributes can be semantic (\u201cspotty\u201d) or discriminative (\u201cdogs have it but sheep do not\u201d). Learning attributes presents a major new challenge: generalization across object categories, not just across instances within a category. In this paper, we also introduce a novel feature selection method for learning attributes that generalize well across categories. We support our claims by thorough evaluation that provides insights into the limitations of the standard recognition paradigm of naming and demonstrates the new abilities provided by our attribute-based framework."

Using simple text queries such as \"smiling men with blond hair and mustaches,\" users can search through over 3.1 million faces which have been automatically labeled on the basis of several facial attributes. Faces in our database have been extracted and aligned from images downloaded from the internet using a commercial face detector, and the number of images and attributes continues to grow daily. Our classification approach uses a novel combination of Support Vector Machines and Adaboost which exploits the strong structure of faces to select and train on the optimal set of features for each attribute. We show state-of-the-art classification results compared to previous works, and demonstrate the power of our architecture through a functional, large-scale face search engine. Our framework is fully automatic, easy to scale, and computes all labels off-line, leading to fast on-line search performance. In addition, we describe how our system can be used for a number of applications, including law enforcement, social networks, and personal photo management. Our search engine will soon be made publicly available."

For example, we may want to simultaneously label every image region according to its basic-level object category (car, building, road, tree, etc.), superordinate category (animal, vehicle, manmade object, natural object, etc.), geometric orientation (horizontal, vertical, etc.), and material (metal, glass, wood, etc.). Some object regions may also be given part names (a car can have wheels, doors, windshield, etc.). We compute co-occurrence statistics between different label types of the same region to capture relationships such as \u201croads are horizontal,\u201d \u201ccars are made of metal,\u201d \u201ccars have wheels\u201d but \u201chorses have legs,\u201d and so on. By incorporating these constraints into a Markov Random Field inference framework and jointly solving for all the label sets, we are able to improve the classification accuracy for all the label sets at once, achieving a richer form of image understanding."

Existing multi-class active learning approaches have focused on utilizing classification uncertainty of regions to select the most ambiguous region for labeling. These approaches, however, ignore the contextual interactions between different regions of the image and the fact that knowing the label for one region provides information about the labels of other regions. For example, the knowledge of a region being sea is informative about regions satisfying the \u201con\u201d relationship with respect to it, since they are highly likely to be boats. We explicitly model the contextual interactions between regions and select the question which leads to the maximum reduction in the combined entropy of all the regions in the image (image entropy). We also introduce a new methodology of posing labeling questions, mimicking the way humans actively learn about their environment. In these questions, we utilize the regions linked to a concept with high confidence as anchors, to pose questions about the uncertain regions. For example, if we can recognize water in an image then we can use the region associated with water as an anchor to pose questions such as \u201cwhat is above water?\u201d. Our active learning framework also introduces questions which help in actively learning contextual concepts. For example, our approach asks the annotator: \u201cWhat is the relationship between boat and water?\u201d and utilizes the answer to reduce the image entropies throughout the training dataset and obtain more relevant training examples for appearance models."

The ability to predict the performance of a recognition system based on its outputs for each match instance is desirable for a number of important reasons, including automatic threshold selection for determining matches and nonmatches, and automatic algorithm selection or weighting for multi-algorithm fusion. The emerging body of literature on postrecognition score analysis has been largely constrained to biometrics, where the analysis has been shown to successfully complement or replace image quality metrics as a predictor. We develop a new statistical predictor based upon the Weibull distribution, which produces accurate results on a per instance recognition basis across different recognition problems. Experimental results are provided for two different face recognition algorithms, a fingerprint recognition algorithm, a SIFT-based object recognition system, and a content-based image retrieval system."

                "text": "Recognition problems in computer vision often benefit from a fusion of different algorithms and/or sensors, with score level fusion being among the most widely used fusion approaches. Choosing an appropriate score normalization technique before fusion is a fundamentally difficult problem because of the disparate nature of the underlying distributions of scores for different sources of data. Further complications are introduced when one or more fusion inputs outright fail or have adversarial inputs, which we find in the fields of biometrics and forgery detection. Ideally a score normalization should be robust to model assumptions, modeling errors, and parameter estimation errors, as well as robust to algorithm failure. In this paper, we introduce the w-score, a new technique for robust recognition score normalization. We do not assume a match or non-match distribution, but instead suggest that the top scores of a recognition system's non-match scores follow the statistical Extreme Value Theory, and show how to use that to provide consistent robust normalization with a strong statistical basis."

The problem is complicated both because it is unclear what facial features humans use to determine facial similarity and because facial similarity is subjective in nature: similarity judgements change from person to person. In this work we suggest a system which places facial similarity on a solid computational footing. First we describe methods for acquiring facial similarity ratings from humans in an efficient manner. Next we show how to create feature vector representations for each face by extracted patches around facial key-points. Finally we show how to use the acquired similarity ratings to learn functional mapping which project facial-feature vectors into face spaces which correspond to our notions of facial similarity. We use different collections of images to both create and validate the face spaces including: perceptual similarity data obtained from humans, morphed faces between two different individuals, and the CMU PIE collection which contains images of the same individual under different lighting conditions. We demonstrate that using our methods we can effectively create face spaces which correspond to human notions of facial similarity."

Users cannot easily find faces with slightly more furrowed brows or specific leftward pose shifts, for example. To address this problem, we propose a new face search technique based on shape manipulation that is complementary to current search engines. Users drag one or a small number of contour points, like the bottom of the chin or the corner of an eyebrow, to search for faces similar in shape to the current face, but with updated geometric attributes specific to their edits. For example, the user can drag a mouth corner to find faces with wider smiles, or the tip of the nose to find faces with a specific pose. As part of our system, we propose (1) a novel confidence score for face alignment results that automatically constructs a contour-aligned face database with reasonable alignment accuracy, (2) a simple and straightforward extension of PCA with missing data to tensor analysis, and (3) a new regularized tensor model to compute shape feature vectors for each aligned face, all built upon previous work. To the best of our knowledge, our system demonstrates the first face retrieval approach based chiefly on shape manipulation. We show compelling results on a sizable database of over 10,000 face images captured in uncontrolled environments."

Most approaches use co-occurrence of \"nouns\" and image features over large datasets to determine the correspondence, but many correspondence ambiguities remain. We further constrain the correspondence problem by exploiting additional language constructs to improve the learning process from weakly labeled data. We consider both \"prepositions\" and \"comparative adjectives\" which are used to express relationships between objects. If the models of such relationships can be determined, they help resolve correspondence ambiguities. However, learning models of these relationships requires solving the correspondence problem. We simultaneously learn the visual features defining \"nouns\" and the differential visual features defining such \"binary-relationships\" using an EM-based approach."

These query tools differ from those used in standard image databases in that they make direct use of the image content rather than relying on text annotations. Direct search on image content is made possible by use of semantics-preserving image compression, which reduces images to a small set of perceptually-significant coefficients. We discuss three types of Photobook descriptions in detail: one that allows search based on appearance, one that uses 2-D shape, and a third that allows search based on textural properties. These image content descriptions can be combined with each other and with text-based descriptions to provide a sophisticated browsing and search capability. In this paper we demonstrate Photobook on databases containing images of people, video keyframes, hand tools, fish, texture swatches, and 3-D medical data."

To obtain human facial similarity ratings, we conduct a subjective study, where a set of human subjects rate the similarity of pairs of faces. Such similarity scores are obtained from 12 subjects on 180 3D faces, with a total of 5490 pairs of similarity scores. We then extract Gabor features from automatically detected fiducial points on the range and texture images from the 3D face and demonstrate that these features correlate well with human judgements of similarity. Finally, we demonstrate the application of using such facial similarity ratings for scalable face recognition."
