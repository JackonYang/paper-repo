In this paper, we propose an experimental method to acquire the layout knowledge automatically from sample document images. In particular, we focus on the acquisition of the layout of business cards.

The system is conceptually simple, and straightforward to implement. It involves three stages of processing. The first stage extracts row-regions from the image, where each row is a hypothesized line of text. The next stage scans an OCR classifier over each row image, creating a character hypothesis graph in the process. This graph is then searched using a priority-queue based algorithm for the best matches with a set of words (lexicon). Performance evaluation on a set of museum archive cards indicates competitive accuracy and also reasonable throughput. The priority queue algorithm is over two hundred times faster than using flat dynamic programming on these graphs."

For the most part these are printed on paper and are dealt with manually, so that each invoice after receipt involves processing costs of about 9 Euro on average. Often, human searching and typing of data into computer forms is required to transfer the information from paper into the computer, e.g. into ERP-systems, like SAP, that many companies run. This article presents the main results of our 300-page market survey of 11 suppliers of invoice reading systems (\\(\\mathcal{I}\\)-\\(\\mathcal{R}\\)-\\(\\mathcal{S}\\)), which automate the transfer of invoice data to ERP-systems. For the scientific \\(\\mathcal{I}\\)-\\(\\mathcal{R}\\)-\\(\\mathcal{S}\\) community we hope to provide the service of a better visibility of our discipline to potential investors and users."

The system first performs optical character recognition to find words and in some cases parts of words (we have observed error rates as high as 10 to 20 percent). For all these \u201cnoisy\u201d words, a set of features is computed which include internal text features, location features, and relationship features. These features are combined to estimate the relevance of the word in the context of the page and the recipient database. The parameters of the word relevance function are learned from training data using the AdaBoost learning algorithm. Words are then compared to the database of recipients to find likely matches. The recipients are finally ranked by combining the quality of the matches and the relevance of the words. Experiments are presented which demonstrate the effectiveness of this system on a large set of real data."
