We measured the responses of 247 neurons recorded from the striate cortex of monkeys and cats as a function of the contrast intensity of luminance-modulated spatialtemporal sine-wave grating patterns to provide a qualitative description and a quantitative mathematical formulation of the contast response function (CRF). 2. Qualitatively, it is possible to provide a general description of the contrast response function for the majority of cells as follows: as the luminance contrast of a pattern increases, the response increases in a relatively linear fashion over approximately 50-607o of the response range (generally less than I log unit along the contrast range), the slope of the function then begins a rapid compression to an asymptotic maximum-saturation response level. There is, however, a great deal of variation. from cell to cell, in the exact shape and location of the CRF. 3. Quantitatively, the responses of each cell were analyzed in terms of the leastsquares (parameter optimized) best fit using four different mathematical functions: linear, logarithmic power, and hyperbolic ratio. The results of this procedure showed that, across the range of contrasts measured ( 1.4567o), the hypcrbolic ratio (H ratio) provided the best fit for the vast majority of striate cells: some 7O9o f the cells were best fitted by the H ratio and further, averaged across all cells, the H ratio produced the least average residual variance. 4. The contrast response function is an important factor when considering the spatial properties of cortical cells; nonlinearities in the CRF (compression and saturation) will necessarily influence the spatial tuning. We therefore measured the CRF at different spatial frequencies and used the parameters of the H ratio to test the predictions of two general classes of models. If the overall gain, compression, and saturation are set by the absolute response level (response-set gain), then the CRFs measured at different frequencies should shift horizontally along the contrast axis. Results show that the measured CRFs (tested on the same cell using different spatial frequencies) were shifted primarily vertically, suggesting that the gain, compression, and saturation were set by the absolute contrast level (contrast-set gain), relatively independent of spatial frequency; in terms of the H ratio, the semisaturation contrast and the exponent were relatively constant in comparison to the asymptotic saturation response. Thus, the spatial frequency response functions are relatively constant when measured at different stimulus contrasts. 5. There is a great deal of variation in the location of the dynamic response range, from cell to cell, along the contrast axis: some cells distribute their dynamic response range over the first lOVo of contrast, others the second, etc. (relatively independent of preferred spatial frequency). One might expect this range variation to be an important factor in behavioral contrast discrimination. To provide an indication of the average population response as a function of contrast, all cells were averaged together (percent response relative to each cell 's maximum): the slope of the bcst-fitt ing [nwer function (0.77) falls well within the range of estimates found for human psychophysical contrast discrimination functions."

We have examined the responses of simple cells in the cat's atriate cortex to visual patterns that were designed to reveal the extent to which these cells may be considered to sum light\u2010evoked influences linearly across their receptive fields. We used one\u2010dimensional luminance\u2010modulated bars and grating as stimuli; their orientation was always the same as the preferred orientation of the neurone under study. The stimuli were presented on an oscilloscope screen by a digital computer, which also accumulated neuronal responses and controlled a randomized sequence of stimulus presentations. 2. The majority of simple cells respond to sinusoidal gratings that are moving or whose contrast is modulated in time in a manner consistent with the hypothesis that they have linear spatial summation. Their responses to moving gratings of all spatial frequencies are modulated in synchrony with the passage of the gratings' bars across their receptive fields, and they do not produce unmodulated responses even at the highest spatial frequencies. Many of these cells respond to temporally modulated stationary gratings simply by changing their response amplitude sinusoidally as the spatial phase of the grating the grating is varied. Nonetheless, their behavior appears to indicate linear spatial summation, since we show in an Appendix that the absence of a 'null' phase in a visual neurone need not indicate non\u2010linear spatial summation, and further that a linear neurone lacking a 'null' phase should give responses of the form that we have observed in this type of simple cell. 3. A minority of simple cells appears to have significant non\u2010linearities of spatial summation. These neurones respond to moving gratings of high spatial frequency with a partially or totally unmodulated elevation of firing rate. They have no 'null' phases when tested with stationary gratings, and reveal their non\u2010linearity by giving responses to gratings of some spatial phases that are composed partly or wholly of even harmonics of the stimulus frequency ('on\u2010off' responses). 4. We compared simple receptive fields with their sensitivity to sinusoidal gratings of different spatial frequencies. Qualitatively, the most sensitive subregions of simple cells' receptive fields are roughly the same width as the individual bars of the gratings to which they are most sensitive. Quantitatively, their receptive field profiles measured with thin stationary lines, agree well with predicted profiles derived by Fourier synthesis of their spatial frequency tuning curves."

The experimental paradigm consisted of comparing the response to drifting grating stimuli with linear predictions based on the response to stationary contrast-reversing gratings. The spatial phase dependence of the response to contrast-reversing gratings was consistent with a high degree of linearity of spatial summation within the receptive fields. Furthermore, the preferred direction predicted from the response to stationary gratings generally agreed with the measurements made with drifting gratings. The amount of directional selectivity predicted was, on average, about half the measured value, indicating that nonlinear mechanisms act in concert with linear mechanisms in determining the overall directional selectivity."

                "text": "1. The activity of single units was recorded from the striate cortex (area 17) of anaesthetized, paralysed cats. Responses to stimuli moving at different velocities were examined. 2. Peak evoked firing frequency, rather than fotal evoked spikes, is used throughout as a measure of response. The former mea\u2010ure gives curves of response vs. velocity that correlate well with curves of contrast sensitivity vs. velocity, wheras the latter does not. 3. Cortical receptive fields were classified according to the criteria of Hubel & Wiesel. Simple cells were found to prefer lower velocities (mean 2\u20102 deg sec\u20101) than complex cells (mean 18\u20138 deg sec\u20101). The response of simple cells to stimuli moving faster than 20 deg sec\u20101 is generally poor; complex cells usually discharge briskly to these speeds. 4. Cells classified as hypercomplex by the end\u2010inhibition criterion were further chara\u2010terized as type I or type II, according to the suggestion of Dreher (1972). Type I units are indistinguishable from simple cells in their velocity tuning, and type II units equally clearly resemble complex cells. These results are therefor consistent with Dreher's sbudivision. 5. Teh selectivity of cells for velocity is variable but can be quite marked. The average selectivities of simple and complex cells are not significantly different. There is an inverse correlation between preferred velocity and the sharpness of velocity selectivity for simple cells; no trend is apparent for other cell types. 6. No clear correlation is observed between the velocity preferances of units and their degree of direction selectivity, or receptive field arrangement. Simple cells with \u2018sustainef\u2019 temporal responses to flashed stimuli tend to prefer slower rates of movement than \u2018transient\u2019 ones, and to be less selective for velocity. 7. The results for different cortical cell\u2010types are compared with the velocity tuning of X\u2010 and Y\u2010cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus."

                "text": ".here has already been some discussion concerning hierarchical versus parallel processing of information in the striate cortex and I would like to add a few comments. Hubel and Wiesel,' in their classical papers, differentiated three categories of cells in the cat's striate cortex. They further suggested a hierarchical model which would explain the organization of the receptive fields of each type of cell. Thus only simple cells would receive a direct excitatory input from lateral geniculate neurons (LGN), and a number of simple cells with a common optimal orientation and slightly offset receptive-field positions would then provide the excitatory input to the complex cells. Finally, different complex cells with a common preferred orientation but again with offset receptive-field positions would provide excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the hypercomplex cells. The inhibitory input to the hypercomplex cell would explain that the sharp reduction in the discharge, as an optimally oriented stimulus, is elongated beyond the excitatory region in the receptive field. If the Hubel and Wiesel model is correct, one would expect a basic similarity between the responses of complex and hypercomplex cells. However, on the basis of the organization of their receptive field, we have been able to differentiate four classes of cells in the cat's striate cortex: simple, complex, and two distinct classes of hypercomplex cells. The majority of hypercomplex cells (Fig. 1, Type 1) have responses very similar to those of simple cells and their receptive fields can be subdivided into"

                "text": "1. A longstanding view of simple cells is that they sum their inputs linearly. However, the linear model falls short of a complete account of simple-cell direction selectivity. We have developed a nonlinear model of simple-cell responses (hereafter referred to as the normalization model) to explain a larger body of physiological data. 2. The normalization model consists of an underlying linear stage along with two additional nonlinear stages. The first is a half-squaring nonlinearity; half-squaring is half-wave rectification followed by squaring. The second is a divisive normalization non-linearity in which each model cell is suppressed by the pooled activity of a large number of cells. 3. By comparing responses with counterphase (flickering) gratings and drifting gratings, researchers have demonstrated that there is a nonlinear contribution to simple-cell responses. Specifically they found 1) that the linear prediction from counterphase grating responses underestimates a direction index computed from drifting grating responses, 2) that the linear prediction correctly estimates responses to gratings drifting in the preferred direction, and 3) that the linear prediction overestimates responses to gratings drifting in the nonpreferred direction. 4. We have simulated model cell responses and derived mathematical expressions to demonstrate that the normalization model accounts for this empirical data. Specifically the model behaves as follows. 1) The linear prediction from counterphase data underestimates the direction index computed from drifting grating responses. 2) The linear prediction from counterphase data overestimates the response to gratings drifting in the nonpreferred direction. The discrepancy between the linear prediction and the actual response is greater when using higher contrast stimuli. 3) For an appropriate choice of contrast, the linear prediction from counterphase data correctly estimates the response to gratings drifting in the preferred direction. For higher contrasts the linear prediction overestimates the actual response, and for lower contrasts the linear prediction underestimates the actual response. 5. In addition, the normalization model is qualitatively consistent with data on the dynamics of simple-cell responses. Tolhurst et al. found that simple cells respond with an initial transient burst of activity when a stimulus first appears. The normalization model behaves similarly; it takes some time after a stimulus first appears before the model cells are fully normalized. We derived the dynamics of the model and found that the transient burst of activity in model cells depends in a particular way on stimulus contrast. The burst is short for high-contrast stimuli and longer for low-contrast stimuli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

                "text": "1. Simple cells in cat striate cortex were studied with a number of stimulation paradigms to explore the extent to which linear mechanisms determine direction selectivity. For each paradigm, our aim was to predict the selectivity for the direction of moving stimuli given only the responses to stationary stimuli. We have found that the prediction robustly determines the direction and magnitude of the preferred response but overestimates the nonpreferred response. 2. The main paradigm consisted of comparing the responses of simple cells to contrast reversal sinusoidal gratings with their responses to drifting gratings (of the same orientation, contrast, and spatial and temporal frequencies) in both directions of motion. Although it is known that simple cells display spatiotemporally inseparable responses to contrast reversal gratings, this spatiotemporal inseparability is demonstrated here to predict a certain amount of direction selectivity under the assumption that simple cells sum their inputs linearly. 3. The linear prediction of the directional index (DI), a quantitative measure of the degree of direction selectivity, was compared with the measured DI obtained from the responses to drifting gratings. The median value of the ratio of the two was 0.30, indicating that there is a significant nonlinear component to direction selectivity. 4. The absolute magnitudes of the responses to gratings moving in both directions of motion were compared with the linear predictions as well. Whereas the preferred direction response showed only a slight amount of facilitation compared with the linear prediction, there was a significant amount of nonlinear suppression in the nonpreferred direction. 5. Spatiotemporal inseparability was demonstrated also with stationary temporally modulated bars. The time course of response to these bars was different for different positions in the receptive field. The degree of spatiotemporal inseparability measured with sinusoidally modulated bars agreed quantitatively with that measured in experiments with stationary gratings. 6. A linear prediction of the responses to drifting luminance borders was compared with the actual responses. As with the grating experiments, the prediction was qualitatively accurate, giving the correct preferred direction but underestimating the magnitude of direction selectivity observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

We confirmed that a stimulus of orientation orthogonal to a cell\u2019s long axis significantly reduces the cell\u2019s discharge rate. Further experiments revealed the following, (i) The inhibition was typically stronger for simple than for complex cells, (ii) It is very broadly tuned for orientation, all orientations outside the cell\u2019s tuning band having a comparable inhibitory effect. (iii) Similarly, it is broadly tuned for spatial frequency. These last two results suggest that the inhibition arises not from a single cell but from a pool of cells, (iv) The pattern of the discharge of the inhibition in response to stimulation by phase-reversed sinusoidal gratings is consistent with the notion that the inhibition arises from complex cells. A second series of recordings of stimulation by visual noise patterns demonstrated how \u2018cross-orientation inhibition\u2019 prevents simple cells from responding to two-dimensional visual noise while allowing them to respond to comparable one-dimensional noise patterns. We suggest that this mechanism may serve to render simple cells selectively sensitive to one-dimensional stimuli, such as the contours or borders of visual objects."

The expected responses to a counterphase grating, given a strictly linear model, would be the sum of the responses to the two drifting components. The measured responses were not consistent with the linear prediction. For example, nearly all cells showed two positions where the responses approached zero (i.e. two \"null phase positions\"); this was true, even for the most direction selective cells. However, the measured responses were consistent with the hypothesis that direction selectivity is a consequence of the linear spatiotemporal receptive-field structure, coupled with the nonlinearities revealed by the contrast-response function: contrast gain control, halfwave rectification, and expansive exponent. When arranged in a particular sequence, each of these linear and nonlinear mechanisms performs a useful function in a general model of simple cells. The linear spatiotemporal receptive field initiates stimulus selectivity (for direction, orientation, spatial frequency, etc.). The expansive response exponent enhances selectivity. The contrast-set gain control maintains selectivity (over a wide range of contrasts, in spite of the limited dynamic response range and steep slope of the contrast-response function). Rectification conserves metabolic energy."

Under the appropriate conditions, all cells observed showed a progressive response decrement during the stimulation period, regardless of cell classification, i.e., simple, complex, or hypercomplex. 3. The observed response decrement was shown to be largely cortical in origin and could be adequately described with an exponential function of the form R = Rf +(R1-Rf)e-t/T. Time constants derived from such calculations yielded values ranging from 1.92 to 12.45 s under conditions of optimal-stimulation. 4. Most cells showed poststimulation effects, usually a brief period of reduced responsiveness that recovered exponentially. Recovery was essentially complete in about 5-35 s. 5. The degree to which stimuli were effective at inducing response was shown to have significant effects on the magnitude of the response decrement. 6. Several cells showed neural patterns of response and recovery that suggested the operation of intracortical inhibitory mechanisms. 7. A simple two-process model that adequately describes the behavior of all the studied cells is presented. 8.

In these cells an increase in stimulus length beyond an optimal value leads to a rapid decline in response. This decline has been attributed to an intracortical inhibitory input1 which may be driven by layer VI cells with very long receptive fields3. It is now clear, however, that cells in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), exhibit a degree of length tuning similar to that of cortical 'hypercomplex cells'4,5, suggesting that this response property could be generated subcortically. Alternatively, as the dLGN receives a massive corticofugal projection from layer VI cells in the visual cortex6, it is possible that this input has a function in generating length tuning in the dLGN. We have investigated this issue by comparing the length tuning of dLGN cells with and without corticofugal feedback. The data show that corticofugal feedback makes a highly significant contribution to the length tuning of dLGN cells. This raises the possibility that length tuning is an emergent property of the geniculo-cortical loop."

                "text": "The organization of geniculate inputs to a cat's visual cortical cell was studied by a cross-correlation technique. Simultaneous extracellular recordings were made in the lateral geniculate nucleus and in the striate cortex, and neuronal connectivity between a geniculate cell and a striate cell was examined by cross-correlograms of their impulse discharges under photic stimuli. Of 243 pairs of geniculate and striate cells with overlapping receptive fields, 82 showed positive correlations with short (0.9-2.7 ms) delay times. The delays in 65 of the 82 pairs were short enough to infer that the geniculate cell exerted monosynaptic excitatory action on the striate cell. Monosynaptic excitations were found in all types of striate cells. Those in cells with exclusively an on area or an off area (E-on/off cells) or in simple cells originated mostly from X geniculate cells; those in special-complex cells originated exclusively from Y geniculate cells; and those in standard-complex cells arose from both X and Y geniculate cells. The convergence number from geniculate cells to an E-on/off or simple striate cell was estimated as more than 10, since about 1/10 of the discharges from an E-on/off or simple cell in response to a moving stimulus was correlated with discharges from a geniculate cell. A larger convergence number (more than 30) was obtained for complex cells. Convergence from 2 to 5 geniculate cells was actually demonstrated in 17 of the 32 striate cells, each of which was tested in pair with 3-14 geniculate cells. The converging inputs thus observed included both X and Y geniculate cells in one E-on, one simple, and three standard-complex cells. They included both on-center and off-center geniculate cells in one simple, one special-complex, and five standard-complex cells. Under stimulation with a stationary light slit, the center fields but not the surround fields of geniculate cells were found to contribute to the receptive fields of the simple striate cells. However, the surround fields of geniculate cells contributed to the subliminal response areas flanking the central areas of E-on/off cells. The center fields of the geniculate cells also contributed to the central areas of the E-on/off cells. These observations suggest different models for simple cells and E-on/off cells as regards the organization of their geniculate inputs; simple cells may receive inputs from both on-center and off-center geniculate cells, but E-on/off cells receive inputs only from one or the other of them."

In particular, it has been suggested that the orientation and direction selectivity of cells in the visual cortex result from the action of a nonlinear 'shunting' inhibition that emulates an AND\u0096NOT logical operation4. The characteristic biophysical feature of this proposed inhibitory mechanism is that it evokes a large and relatively sustained increase in the conductance of the neuronal membrane while leaving the membrane potential unaffected. This shunting mechanism contrasts with linear 'summative' inhibition in which conductance changes are less prominent, and inhibition is achieved by hyperpolarization of the membrane potential1. In a direct experimental test of the hypothesis that the selectivity of visual cortical neurons depends on shunting inhibition we found no evidence for the large conductance changes predicted by the theory."

The temporal characteristics and contrast sensitivity of this phenomenon were explored by stimulating cortical cells with drifting gratings in which contrast sequentially incremented and decremented in stepwise fashion over time. All responses showed a clear hysteresis, in which contrast gain dropped on average 0.36 log unit and then returned to baseline values within 60 s. Noticeable gain adjustments were seen in as little as 3 s and with peak contrasts as low as 3%. Contrast adaptation was absent in responses from LGN cells. Adaptation was found to depend on temporal frequency of stimulation, with greater and more rapid adaptation at higher temporal frequencies. Two different tests showed that the mechanism controlling response reduction was influenced primarily by stimulus contrast rather than response amplitude. These results support the existence of a rapid and sensitive cortically based system that normalizes the output of cortical cells as a function of local mean contrast. Control of the adaptation appears to arise at least in part across a population of cells, which is consistent with the idea that the gain control serves to limit the information converging from many cells onto subsequent processing areas."

Most striate-cortex cells, however, are fairly narrowly tuned and would be expected to have more-periodic RF's. We have examined this question in recordings of the responses of cat and monkey striate-cortex cells to gratings of increasingly large number of cycles, all centered on the cells' RF's. Simple cells narrowly tuned for spatial frequency were found to increase their responses with increasing numbers of stimulus cycles beyond the 1 1/2 cycles expected from the classical RF shape. Broadly tuned simple cells were found to have less-periodic RF's. Whereas narrowly tuned complex cells were also found to respond maximally to many stimulus cycles, other more broadly tuned complex cells did as well (possibly reflecting summation across many broadly tuned simple cells without regard to phase). A suppressive region was often seen just outside the excitatory two-dimensional spatial-frequency region, at off orientations and/or off spatial frequencies and around the whole RF in space. Most striate cells can thus be described as having periodic RF's in the space domain such that they fire just to patterns whose local spatial-frequency spectra fall within a compact, restricted, roughly circular two-dimensional spatial-frequency region, with an encircling suppressive region in both the space and the frequency domains."

                "text": "1. The selectivity of adaptation to unidirectional motion was examined in neurons of the cat striate cortex. Following prolonged stimulation with a unidirectional high-contrast grating, the responsivity of cortical neurons was reduced. In many units this decrease was restricted to the direction of prior stimulation. This selective adaptation produced changes in the degree of direction selectivity of the cortical units (as measured by the ratio of the response to motion in the preferred direction to that in the nonpreferred direction). 2. The initial strength of the directional preference of a given cortical unit did not determine the degree of direction-selective adaptation. Indeed, even non-direction-selective units could exhibit pronounced direction-selective adaptation. The degree of direction-selective adaptation was also independent of the overall decrease in responsivity during adaptation. 3. There was no difference between simple and complex cells in the total amount of adaptation observed. The selectivity of the adaptation, however, did differ between these two cell types. As a group, simple cells showed significant direction-selective adaptation, whereas complex cells did not. The directional preference of most simple cells decreased following preferred direction adaptation and many highly direction selective simple cells became non-direction selective. In addition, simple cells became significantly more direction selective following nonpreferred direction adaptation. 4. Some complex cells also demonstrated direction-selective adaptation. There was, however, much more variability among complex cells than simple cells. Some complex cells actually increased direction selectivity following preferred direction adaptation. These differences between simple and complex cells suggest that changes in direction selectivity following unidirectional adaptation are not due to simple neuronal fatigue of the unit being recorded, but depend on selective adaptation of afferent inputs to the unit. 5. The spontaneous activity of many cortical neurons decreased following preferred direction adaptation but increased following adaptation in the nonpreferred direction. The response to a stationary grating also decreased following preferred direction adaptation. However, there was very little change in the response to a stationary grating following adaptation in the nonpreferred direction."

                "text": "Mechanisms supporting orientation selectivity of cat striate cortical cells were studied by stimulation with two superimposed sine-wave gratings of different orientations. One grating (base) generated a discharge of known amplitude which could be modified by the second grating (mask). Masks presented at nonoptimal orientations usually reduced the base-generated response, but the degree of reduction varied widely between cells. Cells with narrow orientation tuning tended to be more susceptible to mask presence than broadly tuned cells; similarly, simple cells generally showed more response reduction than did complex cells. The base and mask stimuli were drifted at different temporal frequencies which, in simple cells, permitted the identification of individual response components from each stimulus. This revealed that the reduction of the base response by the mask usually did not vary regularly with mask orientation, although response facilitation from the mask was orientation selective. In some sharply tuned simple cells, response reduction had clear local maxima near the limits of the cell's orientation-tuning function. Response reduction resulted from a nearly pure rightward shift of the response versus log contrast function. The lowest mask contrast yielding reduction was within 0.1-0.3 log unit of the lowest contrast effective for excitation. The temporal-frequency bandpass of the response-reduction mechanism resembled that of most cortical cells. The spatial-frequency bandpass was much broader than is typical for single cortical cells, spanning essentially the entire visual range of the cat. These findings are compatible with a model in which weak intrinsic orientation-selective excitation is enhanced in two stages: (1) control of threshold by nonorientation-selective inhibition that is continuously dependent on stimulus contrast; and (2) in the more narrowly tuned cells, orientation-selective inhibition that has local maxima serving to increase the slope of the orientation-tuning function."

Their responses to moving gratings of all but the lowest spatial frequencies are usually dominated by a component that is not modulated by the passage of the bars of the grating across the receptive field. They give responses to temporally modulated stationary gratings that consist mostly of even harmonics of the stimulus frequency and that vary little in amplitude or wave form as the spatial phase of the grating is varied. 2. We compared complex cells' receptive fields with their sensitivity to sinusoidal gratings of different spatial frequencies. Qualitatively, the receptive fields are usually two to five times wider than the bars of the gratings that stimulate them most effectively. Quantitatively, the receptive field profiles of complex cells are invariably broader than those predicted by Fourier synthesis of their spatial frequency tuning curves, and in particular lack predicted spatially antagonistic regions. 3. We further examined the receptive field organization of these cells, using pairs of stationary lines flashed synchronously on their receptive fields. If both lines are of the same polarity (bright or dark), complex cells respond to the paired stimulus much less well than they do to either of its component bars, unless the bars are separated by less than about one quarter of the width of the receptive field. If the lines are of opposite polarity, one bright and one dark, the opposite situation obtains: closely spaced bars elicit small responses, while paired bars of larger separation are much more effective. In either case, the results are independent in general character of the absolute positions of the stimuli within the receptive field; rather, they depend in a manner characteristic of each cell on the relative positions of the two bars. 4. The two\u2010line interaction profile that plots the change in a complex cell's response to one bar as a function of the position of a second added bar corresponds closely to the receptive field profile predicted from Fourier synthesis of the cell's spatial frequency tuning curve. These profiles may thus reveal the spatial characteristics of subunits within complex cell\u2010receptive fields. We examined the nature of the interaction between these subunits by performing several two\u2010line interaction experiments in which the onset of the second bar was delayed some time after the onset of the first. The results suggest that neighbouring subunits interact in a facilitatory fashion: for an interval after the presentation of one bar, responses to neighbouring bars are enhanced. 5. The subunits of a complex receptive field may, by their spatial properties, determine the spatial selectivities of complex cells, while the nature of the interaction among the subunits may determine these cells' sensitivity and selectivity for moving visual stimuli..."

                "text": "Spatial contrast adaptation, produced by prolonged exposure to high contrast grating patterns, has become an important psychophysical method for isolating spatial and orientation selective channels in the human visual system. It has been reasonably argued that this adaptation may be fundamentally dependent upon the activity of neurones in the striate cortex. To test the validity of this hypothesis, and several others, we measured the general adaptation characteristics of 144 striate neurones using a stimulus protocol comparable to the typical psychophysical methods. In general, during prolonged high contrast stimulation, the responses of most cells exponentially decayed from a transient peak response to a sustained plateau response; following adaptation, the responses to lower contrasts were depressed relative to the unadapted state but then gradually recovered from the transient depression to a sustained plateau. Such adaptation was a property common to both simple and complex cells (the distributions of the quantitative of adaptation were overlapping); there were however small but reliable differences. We compared the neurophysiological contrast adaptation with two psychophysical estimates of human contrast adaptation (threshold contrast elevation and apparent contrast reduction) and found that the time courses and the magnitudes were quite similar. The effect of contrast adaptation on the spatial frequency tuning was assessed by measuring the contrast response function at several different test spatial frequencies before and after adaptation at the optimum centre frequency. We found that the effect of adaptation decreased as the difference between test and adaptation frequency increased. Grating contrast adaptation has been alternatively described as 'constructive gain control' on the one hand and as 'deleterious fatigue' on the other. We tested the effect of contrast adaptation on the contrast response function and found (a) that adaptation shifts the curves vertically downward parallel to the response axis (thus reflecting a decrease in the maximum rate of firing and a deleterious compression of the response range) and (b) that adaptation shifts the curves horizontally to the right parallel to the contrast axis (thus reflecting a true sensitivity shift of the remaining response range for constructive maintenance of high differential sensitivity around the prevailing background level).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

The activity of forty\u2010three neurones in the cat's striate cortex in response to laterally moving sinusoidal gratings of various contrasts was recorded, in order to examine the relationship between response amplitude and contrast. 2. Neurones seemed to exhibit contrast thresholds: stimuli of very low contrast failed to evoke a change in the response amplitude from the concurrent levels of spontaneous activity. 3. The suprathreshold portion of the response\u2010contrast relation was found to be monotonic. Typically, the relation was adequately described as linear up to contrasts of about 0.3, above which, varying degrees of saturation were evident. 4. The response\u2010contrast relation had a higher threshold and a shallower slope when the spatial frequency was not optimal for the neurone. 5. The slope, or gain, of the response\u2010contrast relation for a stimulus of optimal orientation and spatial frequency varied considerably from neurone to neurone. The gains of special complex cells were significantly greater than those of either standard complex cells or simple cells. 6. The distributions of contrast threshold and contrast gain were examined for their dependence on optimal spatial frequency. Contrast threshold was significantly positively correlated with optimal spatial frequency, while contrast gain was significantly negatively correlated with optimal spatial frequency. This behaviour is consistent with an optical contribution to the measured response properties of striate cortical neurones."

                "text": "We have examined the idea that the adaptation of cortical neurons to local contrast levels in a visual stimulus is functionally advantageous. Specifically, cortical cells may have large differential contrast sensitivity as a result of adjustments that center a limited response range around a mean level of contrast. To evaluate this notion, we measured contrast-response functions of cells in striate cortex while systematically adapting them to different contrast levels of stimulus gratings. For the majority of cortical neurons tested, the results of this basic experiment show that contrast-response functions shift laterally along a log-contrast axis so that response functions match mean contrast levels in the stimulus. This implies a contrast-dependent change in the gain of the cell's contrast-response relationship. We define this process as contrast gain control. The degree to which this contrast adjustment occurs varies considerably from cell to cell. There are no obvious differences regarding cell type (simple vs. complex) or laminar distribution. Contrast gain control is almost certainly a cortical function, since lateral geniculate cells and fibers exhibit only minimal effects. Tests presented in the accompanying paper (37) provide additional evidence on the cortical origin of the process. In another series of experiments, the effect of contrast adaptation on physiological estimates of contrast sensitivity was evaluated. Sustained adaptation to contrast levels as low as 3% was capable of nearly doubling the thresholds of most of the cells tested. Adaptation may therefore be an important factor in determinations of the contrast sensitivity of cortical neurons. We tested the spatial extent of the mechanisms responsible for these gain-control effects by attempting to adapt cells using both a large grating and a grating patch limited to that portion of a cell's receptive field from which excitatory discharges could be elicited directly (the central discharge region). Adaptation was found to be an exclusive property of the central region. This held even in the case of hypercomplex cells, which received strong influences from surrounding regions of the visual field. Finally, we measured the time course of contrast adaptation. We found the process to be rather slow, with a mean time constant of approximately 6 s. Once again, there was considerable variability in this value from cell to cell."

Glass micropipettes filled with horseradish peroxidase were used to record extracellularly from single neurones. After studying the receptive field properties, the afferent inputs of the neurones were studied by determining their latency of response to electrical stimulation at different positions along the optic pathway. Some cells were thus classified as receiving a mono\u2010 or polysynaptic input from afferents of the lateral geniculate nucleus (l.g.n.), via X\u2010 or Y\u2010like retinal ganglion cells. Two striking correlations were found between dendritic morphology and receptive field type. All spiny stellate cells, and all star pyramidal cells in layer 4A, had receptive fields with spatially separate on and off subfields (S\u2010type receptive fields). All the identified afferent input to these, the major cell types in layer 4, was monosynaptic from X\u2010 or Y\u2010like afferents. Neurones receiving monosynaptic X\u2010 or Y\u2010like input were not strictly segregated in layer 4 and the lower portion of layer 3. Nevertheless the X\u2010 and Y\u2010like l.g.n. fibres did not converge on any of the single neurones so far studied. Monosynaptic input from the l.g.n. afferents was not restricted to cells lying within layers 4 and 6, the main termination zones of the l.g.n. afferents, but was also received by cells lying in layers 3 and 5. The projection pattern of cells receiving monosynaptic input differed widely, depending on the laminar location of the cell soma. This suggests the presence of a number of divergent paths within the striate cortex. Cells receiving indirect input from the l.g.n. afferents were located mainly within layers 2, 3 and 5. Most pyramidal cells in layer 3 had axons projecting out of the striate cortex, while many axons of the layer 5 pyramids did not. The layer 5 cells showed the most morphological variation of any layer, were the most difficult to activate by electrical stimulation, and contained some cells which responded with the longest latencies of any cells in the striate cortex. This suggests that they were several synapses distant from the l.g.n. input. The majority of cells in layers 2, 3, 4 and 6 had the same basic S\u2010type receptive field structure. Only layer 5 contained a majority of cells with spatially overlapping on and off subfields (C\u2010 and B\u2010type receptive fields).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Studies of perceptual after-effects have been used to infer properties of neurones in the human visual cortex2,4,5 similar to those pattern-selective neurones whose sensitivities have been directly measured in the visual cortex of cats and monkeys6,7. Such inferences are based on two assumptions: first, that perceptual changes result from changes in the distribution of activity within the responding population of neurones; second, that the effect of adaptation on each neurone of the population is to reduce its sensitivity uniformly to all stimuli. The experimental results reported here support the first but challenge the second assumption, as they show that after adaptation to a particular grating the sensitivity of a single neurone to that grating may be reduced more than its sensitivity to other gratings."

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

                "text": "Responses to single and multiple spatial frequency gratings were recorded from eighty\u2010eight cat striate cortex cells. A cell's response to a grating of its optimum spatial frequency (f) was examined both alone and in the presence of gratings of 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2, 3 and 4f, respectively. Some 97% (thirty\u2010seven of thirty\u2010eight) of all simple cells showed significant inhibition of f by one or more of the other frequencies. This inhibition was usually fairly narrowly tuned, with only one or two spatial frequencies producing significant inhibition. Thirty\u2010four simple cells were maximally inhibited by a higher frequency, three by a lower spatial frequency. By far the most common interaction was a considerable inhibition of f by 2f and/or 3f. Of the thirty\u2010seven simple cells showing inhibition to a complex grating, seventeen responded in a manner dependent on the relative phases of the two components. Some showed only inhibition of f; in others, the response to f was either increased or decreased, depending on the relative phase of the two frequencies. The other twenty simple cells showed phase\u2010independent inhibition: the inhibition was of approximately equal amplitude regardless of the relative phase angle of the two grating components. Such phase\u2010independent inhibition cannot be accounted for by linear summation within classical cortical receptive fields. Only eighteen of forty\u2010eight (38%) of the complex cells showed significant inhibition of f by one or more other spatial frequencies. Fourteen of these (29%) were maximally inhibited by a higher spatial frequency, four (8%) by a lower spatial frequency. Inhibitory interactions in complex cells were never dependent on the relative phase of the two component gratings. Six simple cells (16%) and fourteen complex cells (29%) showed significant facilitation of the response to f by one or more (most often lower) spatial frequencies. This enhanced response was greater than the sum of the responses to each component alone, was usually broadly tuned for spatial frequency, and did not depend on the relative phase of the two components. It thus differs from the increased response sometimes seen in a phase\u2010dependent interaction. Some of the observed spatial\u2010frequency\u2010specific interactions are incompatible with either a strictly hierarchical model of cortical architecture or a simple linear filter model of visual cortical processing. The asymmetry of inhibition suggests that it subserves some function other than (or in addition to) the narrowing of spatial frequency tuning functions."

In the cat striate cortex, layer 4 is the main recipient of input from the lateral geniculate nucleus, yet the cells in that layer possess several receptive field properties that are distinct from the geniculate input, including orientation specificity, binocularity, directionality and end-inhibition, the last of which allows cells to respond to edges of a restricted length1\u20134. These properties could be generated by connections within the layer, by its input from the claustrum5 or by the massive projection that layer 4 receives from layer 6 (refs 6\u20139). In the present study, we attempted to determine the functional role of the layer 6 to layer 4 projection by reversible inactivation of layer 6 using the inhibitory transmitter \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA). After inactivating layer 6, cells in layer 4 lost end-inhibition. Cells in layer 2+3, which receive their principal input from layer 4, were similarly affected. The elimination of end-inhibition was specific, other receptive field properties, such as direction selectivity or orientation specificity, remaining intact."

Interactions between visual contours are believed to underlie a wide range of perceptual phenomena, including geometric illusions and aftereffects, contrast adaptation, and visual masking. The physiological mechanisms that might underlie such interactions were studied in the visual cortex of the cat by recording responses of single neurons to pairs of brief stationary stimuli that were separated in time. The results revealed a long-lasting, orientation-selective suppression, termed \u201cpaired-pulse suppression,\u201d which was strongest at the cell's preferred orientation, but which was more broadly tuned for orientation than the excitatory response of the cell. Although the strength and duration of the suppression varied widely, some degree of response reduction was present in most cells studied. The function of this suppression may be to regulate the gain with which visual inputs are transmitted to cortical neurons, thus preventing response saturation and positive feedback."

The ordinal, or serial, position of different types of striate neurons was assessed from their latencies to electrical stimulation of the optic radiations in paralyzed cats anesthetized with N,O/O, (70/30%). 2. The distribution histogram for response latencies of striate neurons to electrical stimulation in the optic radiations shows three broad peaks. These peaks become sharper if the stimulating site is moved from a low point (OR,) to a high point (OR,) in the optic radiations. It is argued that each peak represents a population of cells lying at a different ordinal, or serial, position within the cortical pathway, i.e., receiving a mono-, di-, or polysynaptic excitatory input from the thalamus. 3. The duration separating the peaks, of the order of 1.0 ms, is then taken as the transmission time for conduction of the nervous impulse from one cortical cell to the next. Confirmatory evidence for this value of the cell-to-cell transmission time comes from the measurement of interspike intervals in cortical cells that responded with multiple spikes to electrical stimulation. 4. From the peaks in the distribution of OR, latencies, boundaries have been established to arrive at an ordinal position for 131 cells classified as S, Sh, C, B, or cells with nonoriented or concentric receptive field (N-O and cone), following the terminology of Henry (14). Four ordinal groups were distinguished: group M comprised cells receiving an exclusive monosynaptic input from the thalamus, group C1+,i consisted of cells exhibiting a convergence of excitatory inputs, one of which was monosynaptic; group D was composed of cells in which the lowest order input was disynaptic. Cells were placed in group P if they were driven from the thalamus through three or more synapses. Examination of the distribution of different cell types for these various ordinal groups revealed that no particular cell type was exclusively associated with a single ordinal position. In particular, a large proportion of S-, Sh-, C-, and N-O and cone cells showed a monosynaptic input from the thalamus (groups M and Cl+,)). 5. For the three classes of cell, S, Sh, and C, with sufficient numbers in groups MY cl+n~ and D, a search was made for differences in response properties associated with the various ordinal groups. The properties examined included ocular dominance, direction selectivity, orientation specificity, and receptive-field size. With the exception of the C-cell, which showed a difference of direction selectivity in groups M and Cl+,), we observed no systematic changes in the response properties with differences in ordinal position. 6. For most cell types in cat striate cortex there are examples of neurons receiving a monosynaptic input. It is difficult to reconcile these findings with a hierarchical model for the processing of visual information. It is proposed that these cells are first-order elements of different streams running in parallel within the cortex and that this multiplicity of streams may be associated with the diversity of outputs leaving the striate cortex."

Intra- and extracellular recordings were obtained in paralyzed preparations which were anesthetized with nitrous oxide. The connectivities of the recorded cells were determined from responses to electrical stimulation of afferent and efferent pathways. In parallel to the classification of units as simple and complex cells, the receptive fields were grouped in four classes according to the spatial arrangement of on- and off-areas; class I, fields with exclusive on- or off-areas; class II, fields with spatially separate on- and off-areas; class III, fields with mixed on-off areas; class IV, fields which could not be mapped with stationary stimuli. The results from electrical stimulation suggest two major classes of cells: cells in the first group are driven mainly or exclusively by LGN afferents. They rarely receive additional excitation from intrinsic or callosal afferents and rarely possess corticofugal axons. Cells in the second group receive either converging inputs from LGN afferents and further intrinsic afferents or only from intrinsic afferents. They frequently received additional input from callosum and from recurrent collaterals of corticofugal axons. They project subcortically more often than cells in the first group. Cells in both groups can be driven either by X- or Y-type afferents. Cells in the first group have mainly class I and class II fields or simple fields, whereas the neurons in the second group have mainly class III and class IV fields or complex fields. Thus, simple and complex cells differ in their connectivity patterns, but the discriminative parameter is neither the selective connection to the X- or the Y-system nor, in a strict sense, the synaptic distance from subcortical input. From the combined consideration of receptive-field properties and connectivity patterns it is concluded that class I and class II cells or simple cells are concerned mainly with the primary analysis of subcortical activity, whereas class III and class IV cells or complex cells perform a correlative analysis between highly convergent activity from extrinsic and intrinsic afferents."

                "text": "I. Recordings were obtained from 108 cells near the border of areas 17 and 18 in anesthetized, paralyzed cats. Emphasis was placed on analyzing responses to moving sinusoidal gratings, whose spatial frequency, velocity, and contrast were varied systematically. In the presence of drifting gratings, about 30% of the cells responded with a periodic discharge at virtually all effective spatial and temporal frequencies. These neurons tended to be \u201csimple,\u201d to have very low levels of spontaneous activity, and to have the narrowest spatialand temporal-frequency response functions. Another 30% of the cells responded aperiodically at all but the lowest spatial and temporal frequencies. These cells tended to be \u201ccomplex\u201d and to have the broadest tuning curves. The remaining cells responded periodically over part of the range of effective frequencies, and could be simple, complex, or intermediate and difficult to classify. 2. For most of the neurons that responded appreciably to both directions of movement at the optimal orientation, the peak frequency (and shape) of spatialand/or temporal-frequency response functions differ by more than 0.3 octave for the two directions of movement. The peak frequency and/or bandwidth of the temporal response function for either direction may also depend on whether there is a pause between movements in the two directions. 3. The response of almost all cells increases linearly with contrast up to a saturation level. The threshold contrast shows little dependence on spatial frequency, but is a function of temporal frequency. The slopes of response-contrast functions are steepest at the optimal spatial or temporal frequencies and diminish at lower or higher frequencies. 4. The peak frequency and shape (bandwidth and high-frequency roll-off) of temporal-frequency response functions do not depend significantly on the spatial frequency used to make the measurement and the converse is true. Accordingly, it is possible to use a spatial-frequency tuning curve measured at fixed temporal frequency and a temporal curve measured at fixed spatial frequency to predict the spatial-frequency tuning curve that is obtained when all spatial frequencies are presented at the same velocity. This implies that knowledge of one spatial an .d one temporal curve of a cell allows one to calcu late its response to any combination of spatial and temporal frequencies. 5. The higher a cell\u2019s best spatial frequency, the lower is the optimal velocity of movement at the best spatial frequency. The equation for the regression line that summarizes this correlation has velocity proportional to spatial frequency raised to the -5/4 power."

The responses were summarized by three indices: discreteness was a measure of the degree of separation of inhibitory and excitatory regions in the receptive field; spatial summation ratio showed the degree of spatial summation within each region; relative modulation was a measure of the degree of modulation in the response to a moving grating. Some neurones had receptive fields with completely discrete excitatory and inhibitory regions; others responded equally to stimulus onset and offset throughout their receptive fields; however, some had overlapping excitatory and inhibitory regions. The degree of overlap varied continuously from complete separation to complete overlap. For neurones with discrete receptive fields, the widths of the regions were compared with the width of the bars in a grating of optimum spatial frequency to assess the degree of spatial summation within the regions. Most neurones with discrete receptive fields showed roughly predictable spatial summation, in that the two width measures agreed; but about 10% of them had receptive field regions that were too large by a factor of over two. The neurones which showed incomplete spatial summation also had considerable overlap of their excitatory and inhibitory regions. The waveforms of the responses to moving gratings of optimal spatial frequency were examined. The degree of modulation in the response was continuously distributed between low values typical of complex cells and high values typical of simple cells; the distribution was not bimodal. The degree of response modulation was closely correlated with the degree to which the excitatory and inhibitory regions in the receptive field were discrete. Both the degree of spatial summation and the degree of response modulation have been previously proposed as means for distinguishing simple and complex cells. In the present study, the continuity of the distributions of both indices ensured that neither index alone could be used to class all neurones unequivocally. However, a criterion based on two indices did allow classification. Simple and complex cells showed distinctive behaviour. However, complex cells with distinguishable excitatory and inhibitory regions in their receptive fields were not distinctly different from other complex cells."

From the amplitudes and temporal phases of the responses to stationary gratings of different spatial phases, it should be possible to predict the preferred direction of movement, the amplitudes of the responses to gratings moving in the preferred and nonpreferred directions and, thence, the degree of directional preference (Reid et al., 1987). The preferred direction can be predicted reliably. However, the magnitude of the directional preference cannot be predicted, since the measured amplitude of the response in the nonpreferred direction of movement is very much less than that predicted by a linear theory. Nonlinearities in the relationship between response amplitude and contrast may contribute to the failure of the predictions, but this contribution is small. We conclude that the magnitude of the directional preference seems to be determined predominantly by nonlinear suppression of the response in the nonpreferred direction of movement."

On the basis of physiological data, this orientation selectivity is hypothesized as being due at least partially to intracortical inhibitory mechanisms2\u20136. But this hypothesis has been challenged by intracellular recordings indicating that excitatory inputs themselves are orientation-selective, so inhibition may not contribute to the observed selectivity7. Also, there is controversy about the presence of intracortical horizontal connections mediating inhibition for selectivity8\u201311 and about the theoretical validity of such inhibitory connections12\u201314. Using cross-correlation analysis of the activities of two neurons recorded simultaneously, we find that inhibitory interactions exist between cells with somewhat different, but not orthogonal, orientation preferences. This suggests that intracortical horizontal inhibition operates between 'orientation columns' to sharpen the orientation tuning of cortical neurons."

Higher order neurones in the visual pathway are presumably more concerned with relative changes in illumination, that is, contrast, because a great deal of information concerning absolute light level is processed at the retinal level3. It would therefore be of considerable functional value if cells in the visual cortex could adapt their response levels to a steady-state ambient contrast, in a manner analogous to the sensitivity control mechanism of the retina. We have examined here the idea that adaptation of neurones in the visual cortex to ambient contrast is similar to adaptation in the retina to ambient illumination. The experiments were performed by measuring contrast response functions (response amplitude as a function of contrast) of striate neurones, while systematically adapting them to different contrast levels. Our results show that, for the majority of cortical neurones, response\u2013contrast curves are laterally shifted along a log-contrast axis so that the effective domains of neurones are adjusted to match prevailing contrast levels. This contrast gain control mechanism, which was not observed for lateral geniculate (LGN) fibres, must be of prime importance to visual function."

After application of an extrapolation procedure to compensate for the conduction time of the afferent axons, a histogram of latencies formed three distinct peaks. Potentials in each of these were interpreted as being mediated by mono\u2010, di\u2010 and trisynaptic pathways. Characteristic laminar differences in the extracellular field potentials evoked from the lateral geniculate nucleus (l.g.n.) and in the antidromic activation of neurones from the l.g.n. and superior colliculus were used to determine the laminar position of recorded neurones. It was found that within a given layer, all cells maintained similar connexions with relay cells in the l.g.n. Cells in layers 3, 4, upper 5 and 6 were monosynaptically excited by geniculate afferents, while cells in layers 2 and lower 5 received only indirect excitation via other cortical neurones. Layer 3 cells were unique in receiving a prominent disynaptic e.p.s.p. in addition to the direct excitation from the l.g.n. Late, trisynaptic e.p.s.p. components were seen in many layer 5 and 6 cells. The orderly laminar arrangement of the connexions had the consequence that identified cortico\u2010geniculate neurones were monosynaptically excited and cortico\u2010collicular neurones di\u2010 and trisynaptically excited by geniculate afferents. Cortico\u2010cortical neurones in layers 2 and 3 received di\u2010 or mono\u2010 plus disynaptic excitation, depending on laminar position. Post\u2010synaptic inhibitory potentials were evoked in all impaled cells, following stimulation of the geniculo\u2010cortical pathway. Except for a few layer 2 cells, this inhibition was mediated through disynaptic pathways of the feed\u2010forward type. There was a good positive correlation between conduction times for monosynaptic e.p.s.p.s and disynaptic i.p.s.p.s in the same cells, suggesting that cortical neurones receive excitation and inhibition from the same type of geniculate afferents. The stimulating electrodes activated not only geniculo\u2010cortical afferents, but antidromically activated cortical efferent neurones from their extracortical axons. These neurones possess intracortical collaterals, and care must be taken to distinguish the resulting potentials from those mediated by orthodromic activation of geniculate afferents. In doing so, evidence was obtained for excitatory connexions from layers 2 and 3 to layer 5, from layer 5 to layer 6, and from layer 6 to layer 4. Typical recurrent inhibition was not observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Linearity of spatial summation was examined using the test devised by Hochstein & Shapley (1976). 2 of 272 parvocellular units and 6 of 105 magnocellular units showed clearly non\u2010linear spatial summation. A quantitative index of non\u2010linearity did not suggest the existence of a distinct 'non\u2010linear' class of magnocellular unit. Spatial contrast sensitivity to moving gratings was measured by a tracking procedure in which contrast was adjusted to elicit a reliable modulation of discharge. With the exception of cells that were driven by blue\u2010sensitive cones, measurements of contrast sensitivity did not reveal distinct subgroups of parvocellular units. All had low sensitivity, and those with receptive fields in the fovea could resolve spatial frequencies of up to 40 cycles deg\u20101. Magnocellular units had substantially higher sensitivity, but poorer spatial resolution. The higher sensitivities of magnocellular units led to their giving saturated responses to stimuli of high contrast. Responses of parvocellular units were rarely saturated by any stimulus. At any one eccentricity the receptive fields of parvocellular units had smaller centres than did those of magnocellular units. Receptive fields of magnocellular units driven by the ipsilateral eye had larger receptive fields than did those driven by the contralateral eye. Parvocellular units were most sensitive to stimuli modulated at temporal frequencies close to 10 Hz; magnocellular units to stimuli modulated at frequencies nearer 20 Hz. The loss of sensitivity as temporal frequency fell below optimum was more marked in magnocellular than parvocellular units. Changes in temporal frequency altered the shapes of the spatial contrast sensitivity curves of both parvocellular and magnocellular units. These changes could be explained by supposing that centre and surround have different temporal properties, and that the surround is relatively less sensitive to higher temporal frequencies."

                "text": "We have studied the manner by which inputs from the two eyes are combined in simple cells of the cat's visual cortex. The stimuli for this study are drifting sinusoidal gratings, shown dichoptically at optimal spatial frequency and orientation. The relative spatial phase (disparity) between the gratings for left and right eyes is varied over 360 degrees. Most simple cells show phase-specific binocular interaction such that response amplitudes and phases vary depending on the relative spatial phase. At one phase, response is greater than either of the monocular responses and often greater than the sum of the two. At the phase 180 degrees away from the optimal, the cell's responses are strongly inhibited and often completely suppressed. Phase-specific binocular interaction disappears when the gratings presented to one eye are made orthogonal to the optimal orientation. The degree of binocular interaction does not depend critically on the ocular dominance of the cells. Simple cells that are nearly equally dominated by each eye always exhibit strong phase-specific interaction. The majority of cells that are strongly dominated by one eye, and even those that appear monocular, show phase-dependent changes in responses. We examined the extent of binocular interaction for cells with preferred orientations near vertical compared with those tuned to other optimal orientations. If these cells are conveying information about depth, one might expect a greater degree of binocular phase-specificity for units preferring nearly vertical orientations, which would then be processing horizontal disparities. We find no evidence for this. Predictions of simple-cell responses are derived from a linear model of binocular convergence in which light-evoked neural signals from each eye are summed linearly to determine cell responses. Data from cells generally follow the prediction of the model for both response amplitude and phase. Deviations from predictions of the linear model are found for a minority of cells. This deviation may be accounted for by a threshold mechanism that comes into play after the linear binocular summation. A small proportion of simple cells that appear monocular by alternate tests of each eye show a purely inhibitory influence from the silent eye. This inhibition is not generally dependent on the relative phase of the gratings. We conclude that most binocular interaction in striate simple cells may be accounted for by linear summation of neural signals from each eye.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

This model accurately predicts the psychophysical results of flicker detection (DeLange characteristics at above 10 Hz), the Ferry\u2013Porter and Weber laws in the ranges where they apply, the effects of light adaptation, and it accounts for individual differences. By considering the variable RC stage as an approximate analog of a synaptic excitatory process which is controlled by inhibition, significant correspondences are observed between the internal connectivity of the model and the neural connectivity of the retina."

Particular attention is given to the fact that receptive field profiles of simple cells in the visual cortex often resemble even-symmetric or odd-symmetric Gabor filters; i.e. their receptive field profiles can be described by the product of a Gaussian and either a cosine or sine function. Their spatial frequency tuning is of medium bandwidth (~one octave) which is narrow enough for a cell to distinguish the third harmonic from the fundamental frequency for square-wave gratings of low spatial frequency. The responses of adjacent simple cells, tuned to the same spatial frequency, orientation, and direction, differ in their phase response to drifting sine-wave gratings by approximately either 90\u00b0 or 180\u00b0. This latter result makes it possible to consider two adjacent simple cell pairs as operating like paired Gaussian-attenuated sine and cosine filters of Gabor filters for restricted regions of visual space. The entire set of simple cells provides a complete representation of the visual scene, yet each simple cell is unique in its response properties. At the complex cell stage, the cell's mean firing rate appears to represent the amplitude of a local Fourier coefficient, but phase information is seldom conveyed with much precision in the action potential code."

                "text": "1. We have examined the spatial and temporal tuning properties of 238 cortical neurones, recorded using conventional techniques from acutely prepared anaesthetized cats. We determined spatial and temporal frequency tuning curves using sinusoidal grating stimuli presented to each neurone's receptive field by a digital computer on a cathode ray tube. 2. We measured tuning curves either by determining response amplitude as a function of spatial or temporal frequency, or by measuring contrast sensitivity (the inverse of the contrast of the grating that just elicited a detectable response). The two measures give very similar tuning curves in all cases. 3. We recorded from 184 neurones in area 17; of these 156 had receptive fields within 5 degrees of the area centralis. The range of preferred spatial frequency for these neurones was 0.3\u2010\u20103 c/deg, and their spatial frequency tuning band widths varied from 0.7 to 3.2 octaves at half\u2010amplitude. The most common band width was roughly 1.3 octaves. Simple and complex cells in area 17 did not differ in their distributions of preferred spatial frequency, although complex cells were, on average, slightly less selective for spatial frequency than simple cells. 4. We recorded from fifty\u2010four neurones from area 18, and performed several experiments in which we recorded from corresponding portions of both area 17 and area 18 in the same electrode penetration. Neurones in area 18 preferred spatial frequencies that were, on average, one third as high as those preferred by area 17 neurones at the same retinal eccentricity. Thus the range of preferred spatial frequency in area eighteen cells having receptive fields within 5 deg of the area centralis was between less than 0.1 and 0.5 c/deg. The distributions of optimum spatial frequency in the two areas were practically non\u2010overlapping at eccentricities as high as 15 deg, the greatest eccentricity we examined. Neurones in area 18 were about as selective for spatial frequency as were neurones in area 17. 5. We determined temporal frequency tuning characteristics for some neurones from each area, using gratings that moved steadily across the screen. Neurones from area 17 all responded well to low temporal frequencies, and less well to higher frequencies (in excess of, usually, 2 or 4 Hz). In contrast, neurones recorded from area 18 sometimes had similar tuning properties, but more commonly showed a pronounced reduction in response as the temporal frequency was moved either above or below some optimum value (usually 2\u2010\u20108 Hz). 6. We conclude from these results that areas 17 and 18 act in parallel to process different aspects of the visual information relayed from the retina via the lateral geniculate complex. Some or all of the differences between the areas may be attributable to the predominance of Y cell input to area 18 and the predominance of X cell input to area 17..."

Motion sinformation can be extracted by a system that responds to the oriented spatiotemporal energy. We discuss a class of models for human motion mechanisms in which the first stage consists of linear filters that are oriented in space-time and tuned in spatial frequency. The outputs of quadrature pairs of such filters are squared and summed to give a measure of motion energy. These responses are then fed into an opponent stage. Energy models can be built from elements that are consistent with known physiology and psychophysics, and they permit a qualitative understanding of a variety of motion phenomena."

Aftereffects were induced largely independent of direction. Adapting in either direction reduced responses in both directions. Aftereffects in the direction opposite that adapted were only slightly weaker than were aftereffects in the adapted direction. No cell showed any enhancement of responses to drifting test stimuli after adapting with moving gratings. Adapting in a cell's null direction usually had no effect. Dramatic differences between the adaptation characteristics of moving and stationary stimuli were observed, however. Furthermore, aftereffects were temporal frequency specific. Temporal frequency-specific aftereffects were found in both directions: adapting in one direction induced frequency-specific effects in both directions. This bidirectionality of frequency-specific aftereffects applied to the spatial domain as well. Often, aftereffects in the direction opposite that adapted were more narrowly tuned. In general, adaptation could shift a cell's preferred temporal frequency. Aftereffects were most prominent at high temporal frequencies when testing in the adapted direction. Aftereffects seemed to be more closely linked to temporal frequency than to velocity matching. These results constrain models of cortical connectivity. In particular, we argue against schemes by which direction selectivity is generated by inhibiting a cell specifically when stimulated in the nonpreferred direction. Instead, we argue that cells receive bidirectional spatially and temporally tuned inputs, which could combine in spatiotemporal quadrature to produce direction selectivity."

                "text": "We have compared the effects of contrast on human psychophysical orientation and spatial frequency discrimination thresholds and on the responses of individual neurons in the cat's striate cortex. Contrast has similar effects on orientation and spatial frequency discrimination: as contrast is increased above detection threshold, orientation and spatial frequency discrimination performance improves but reaches maximum levels at quite low contrasts. Further increases in contrast produce no further improvements in discrimination. We measured the effects of contrast on response amplitude, orientation and spatial frequency selectivity, and response variance of neurons in the cat's striate cortex. Orientation and spatial frequency selectivity vary little with contrast. Also, the ratio of response variance to response mean is unaffected by contrast. Although, in many cells, response amplitude increases approximately linearly with log contrast over most of the visible range, some cells show complete or partial saturation of response amplitude at medium contrasts. Therefore, some cells show a clear increase in slope of the orientation and spatial frequency tuning functions with increasing contrast, whereas in others the slopes reach maximum values at medium contrasts. Using receiver operating characteristic analysis, we estimated the minimum orientation and spatial frequency differences that can be signaled reliably as a response change by an individual cell. This analysis shows that, on average, the discrimination of orientation or spatial frequency improves with contrast at low contrasts more than at higher contrasts. Using the optimal stimulus for each cell, we estimated the contrast threshold of 48 neurons. Most cells had contrast thresholds below 5%. Thresholds were only slightly higher for nonoptimal stimuli. Therefore, increasing the contrast of sinusoidal gratings above approximately 10% will not produce large increases in the number of responding cells. The observed effects of contrast on the response characteristics of nonsaturating cortical cells do not appear consistent with the psychophysical results. Cells that reach their maximum response at low-to-medium contrasts may account for the contrast independence of psychophysical orientation and spatial frequency discrimination thresholds at medium and high contrasts."

In standard conditions the background was a two-dimensional (2D) noise pattern, the bar moved at optimal speed, and its contrast level was adjusted to yield 50% of the maximum response. Neuronal responses to the moving bar were suppressed when the background moved at the same speed or faster than the bar. The direction of motion of the bar had little influence. This suppressive effect was equally strong in all three experimental samples. The suppressive effect of the moving background was uniformly distributed among the cortical population, being equally strong in all layers, in all parts of the visual field representation, and for different categories of cortical cells. The suppressive effect of the moving background depended little on the structure of the background or on the speed of the bar. The suppression increased with decreasing contrast of the bar. Many (80%) cortical cells and all geniculate neurons responded to the movement of the 2D noise on its own. Most of these cells responded to isolated features (\"grains\") in the pattern rather than to movement of the whole pattern. There was no difference in strength of suppression between cortical neurons responsive and unresponsive to the moving 2D noise. The possible origins of this suppressive influence of moving backgrounds and its significance for the processing of visual scenes, more complicated than a single stimulus, are discussed."

This paper shows that if the adaptation process follows a simple scheme, called proportional gain adjustment, then it can fulfil two useful functions : correction of errors and recalibration. The proposed scheme controls the gain of the system. Although it is memoryless, it ensures a setting of the gain at such a level that the average of the measured signal in the environment is always mapped onto a fixed internal representation. The proportional gain adjustment scheme is discussed in the context of single-band multi-channel models, and is shown to exhibit various phenomena associated with visual adaptation."
