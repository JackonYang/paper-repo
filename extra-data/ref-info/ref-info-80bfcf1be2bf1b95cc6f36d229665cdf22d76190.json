Given a set of examples, we train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform the above estimation task. Different from other learning methods, the CNNs learn both spatial and temporal features jointly from image pairs of two adjacent frames. We introduce multiple path ways in CNN to better fuse local and global information. A creative shift-variant CNN architecture is designed so as to alleviate the drift problem when the distracting objects are similar to the target in cluttered environment. Furthermore, we employ CNNs to estimate the scale through the accurate localization of some key points. These techniques are object-independent so that the proposed method can be applied to track other types of object. The capability of the tracker of handling complex situations is demonstrated in many testing sequences."

In this paper, we propose using unsupervised feature learning as a way to learn features directly from video data. More specifically, we present an extension of the Independent Subspace Analysis algorithm to learn invariant spatio-temporal features from unlabeled video data. We discovered that, despite its simplicity, this method performs surprisingly well when combined with deep learning techniques such as stacking and convolution to learn hierarchical representations. By replacing hand-designed features with our learned features, we achieve classification results superior to all previous published results on the Hollywood2, UCF, KTH and YouTube action recognition datasets. On the challenging Hollywood2 and YouTube action datasets we obtain 53.3% and 75.8% respectively, which are approximately 5% better than the current best published results. Further benefits of this method, such as the ease of training and the efficiency of training and prediction, will also be discussed.

Our model is based on the recently proposed hidden conditional random field (HCRF) for object recognition. Similarly to HCRF for object recognition, we model a human action by a flexible constellation of parts conditioned on image observations. Differently from object recognition, our model combines both large-scale global features and local patch features to distinguish various actions. Our experimental results show that our model is comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches in action recognition. In particular, our experimental results demonstrate that combining large-scale global features and local patch features performs significantly better than directly applying HCRF on local patches alone. We also propose an alternative for learning the parameters of an HCRF model in a max-margin framework. We call this method the max-margin hidden conditional random field (MMHCRF). We demonstrate that MMHCRF outperforms HCRF in human action recognition. In addition, MMHCRF can handle a much broader range of complex hidden structures arising in various problems in computer vision."

This challenging but important subject has mostly been ignored in the past due to several problems one of which is the lack of realistic and annotated video datasets. Our first contribution is to address this limitation and to investigate the use of movie scripts for automatic annotation of human actions in videos. We evaluate alternative methods for action retrieval from scripts and show benefits of a text-based classifier. Using the retrieved action samples for visual learning, we next turn to the problem of action classification in video. We present a new method for video classification that builds upon and extends several recent ideas including local space-time features, space-time pyramids and multi-channel non-linear SVMs. The method is shown to improve state-of-the-art results on the standard KTH action dataset by achieving 91.8% accuracy. Given the inherent problem of noisy labels in automatic annotation, we particularly investigate and show high tolerance of our method to annotation errors in the training set. We finally apply the method to learning and classifying challenging action classes in movies and show promising results."

                "text": "Recent years have witnessed significant progress in detection of basic human actions. However, most existing methods rely on assumptions such as known spatial locations and temporal segmentations or employ very computationally expensive approaches such as sliding window search through a spatio-temporal volume. It is difficult for such methods to scale up to handle the challenges in real applications such as video surveillance. In this paper, we present an efficient and practical approach to detecting basic human actions, such as making cell phone calls, putting down objects, and hand-pointing, which has been extensively tested on the challenging 2008 TRECVID surveillance event detection dataset . We propose a novel action representation scheme using a set of motion edge history images, which not only encodes both shape and motion patterns of actions without relying on precise alignment of human figures, but also facilitates learning of fast tree-structured boosting classifiers. Our approach is robust with respect to cluttered background as well as scale and viewpoint changes. It is also computationally efficient by taking advantage of human detection and tracking to reduce the searching space. We demonstrate promising results on the 50-hour TRECVID development set as well as two other widely-used benchmark datasets of action recognition, i.e. the KTH dataset and the Weizmann dataset."

One system employs the brute force search method to test each space-time location in the video by a binary classifier on whether a specific event occurs. The other system takes advantage of human detection and tracking to avoid the costly brute force search and evaluates the candidate space-time cubes by combining 3D convolutional neural networks (CNN) and SVM classifiers based on bag-ofwords local features to detect the presence of events of inte rests. Via thorough cross-validation on the development set , we select proper combining weights and thresholds to minimize the detection cost rates (DCR). Our systems achieve good performance on event categories which involve actions of a single person, e.g. CellToEar , ObjectPut , and Pointing."

The method consists of three stages: preprocessing, feature extraction, and pattern classification. For feature extraction, we propose a modified convolutional neural network (CNN) which has a three-dimensional receptive field. The CNN generates a set of feature maps from the action descriptors which are derived from a spatiotemporal volume. A weighted fuzzy min-max (WFMM) neural network is used for the pattern classification stage. We introduce a feature selection technique using the WFMM model to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. Two kinds of relevance factors between features and pattern classes are defined to analyze the salient features."

Such unconstrained videos are abundant in personal collections as well as on the Web. Recognizing action from such videos has not been addressed extensively, primarily due to the tremendous variations that result from camera motion, background clutter, changes in object appearance, and scale, etc. The main challenge is how to extract reliable and informative features from the unconstrained videos. We extract both motion and static features from the videos. Since the raw features of both types are dense yet noisy, we propose strategies to prune these features. We use motion statistics to acquire stable motion features and clean static features. Furthermore, PageRank is used to mine the most informative static features. In order to further construct compact yet discriminative visual vocabularies, a divisive information-theoretic algorithm is employed to group semantically related features. Finally, AdaBoost is chosen to integrate all the heterogeneous yet complementary features for recognition. We have tested the framework on the KTH dataset and our own dataset consisting of 11 categories of actions collected from YouTube and personal videos, and have obtained impressive results for action recognition and action localization."

Several methods for feature localization and description have been proposed in the literature and promising recognition results were demonstrated for a number of action classes. The comparison of existing methods, however, is often limited given the different experimental settings used. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate and compare previously proposed space-time features in a common experimental setup. In particular, we consider four different feature detectors and six local feature descriptors and use a standard bag-of-features SVM approach for action recognition. We investigate the performance of these methods on a total of 25 action classes distributed over three datasets with varying difficulty. Among interesting conclusions, we demonstrate that regular sampling of space-time features consistently outperforms all tested space-time interest point detectors for human actions in realistic settings. We also demonstrate a consistent ranking for the majority of methods over different datasets and discuss their advantages and limitations."

We also use our model to extract low-level motion features in a multi-stage architecture for action recognition, demonstrating competitive performance on both the KTH and Hollywood2 datasets."

However, most published methods either analyse an entire video and assign it a single action label, or use relatively large look-ahead to classify each frame. Contrary to these strategies, human vision proves that simple actions can be recognised almost instantaneously. In this paper, we present a system for action recognition from very short sequences (ldquosnippetsrdquo) of 1-10 frames, and systematically evaluate it on standard data sets. It turns out that even local shape and optic flow for a single frame are enough to achieve ap90% correct recognitions, and snippets of 5-7 frames (0.3-0.5 seconds of video) are enough to achieve a performance similar to the one obtainable with the entire video sequence."

To this end we consider two associated problems: (a) weakly-supervised learning of action models from readily available annotations, and (b) temporal localization of human actions in test videos. To avoid the prohibitive cost of manual annotation for training, we use movie scripts as a means of weak supervision. Scripts, however, provide only implicit, noisy, and imprecise information about the type and location of actions in video. We address this problem with a kernel-based discriminative clustering algorithm that locates actions in the weakly-labeled training data. Using the obtained action samples, we train temporal action detectors and apply them to locate actions in the raw video data. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method for weakly-supervised learning of action models leads to significant improvement in action detection. We present detection results for three action classes in four feature length movies with challenging and realistic video data."

Human actions are frequently constrained by the purpose and the physical properties of scenes and demonstrate high correlation with particular scene classes. For example, eating often happens in a kitchen while running is more common outdoors. The contribution of this paper is three-fold: (a) we automatically discover relevant scene classes and their correlation with human actions, (b) we show how to learn selected scene classes from video without manual supervision and (c) we develop a joint framework for action and scene recognition and demonstrate improved recognition of both in natural video. We use movie scripts as a means of automatic supervision for training. For selected action classes we identify correlated scene classes in text and then retrieve video samples of actions and scenes for training using script-to-video alignment. Our visual models for scenes and actions are formulated within the bag-of-features framework and are combined in a joint scene-action SVM-based classifier. We report experimental results and validate the method on a new large dataset with twelve action classes and ten scene classes acquired from 69 movies."

We show that our model outperforms another similar method that uses hidden conditional random fields, and is comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches.

The approach builds on recent work on object recognition based on hierarchical feedforward architectures [25, 16, 20] and extends a neurobiological model of motion processing in the visual cortex [10]. The system consists of a hierarchy of spatio-temporal feature detectors of increasing complexity: an input sequence is first analyzed by an array of motion- direction sensitive units which, through a hierarchy of processing stages, lead to position-invariant spatio-temporal feature detectors. We experiment with different types of motion-direction sensitive units as well as different system architectures. As in [16], we find that sparse features in intermediate stages outperform dense ones and that using a simple feature selection approach leads to an efficient system that performs better with far fewer features. We test the approach on different publicly available action datasets, in all cases achieving the highest results reported to date."

While feature-learning machines in the form of hierarchial feed-forward models (e.g., convolutional neural networks) showed promise in this direction, they are still difficult to train especially when few training examples are available. In this paper, we present a framework for training hierarchical feed-forward models for visual recognition, using transfer learning from pseudo tasks. These pseudo tasks are automatically constructed from data without supervision and comprise a set of simple pattern-matching operations. We show that these pseudo tasks induce an informative inverse-Wishart prior on the functional behavior of the network, offering an effective way to incorporate useful prior knowledge into the network training. In addition to being extremely simple to implement, and adaptable across different domains with little or no extra tuning, our approach achieves promising results on challenging visual recognition tasks, including object recognition, gender recognition, and ethnicity recognition."

Our approach can handle noisy feature points arisen from dynamic background and moving cameras due to the application of the probabilistic models. Given a novel video sequence, the algorithm can categorize and localize the human action(s) contained in the video. We test our algorithm on three challenging datasets: the KTH human motion dataset, the Weizmann human action dataset, and a recent dataset of figure skating actions. Our results reflect the promise of such a simple approach. In addition, our algorithm can recognize and localize multiple actions in long and complex video sequences containing multiple motions."

For the purpose of evaluation we introduce a new video database containing 2391 sequences of six human actions performed by 25 people in four different scenarios.

                "text": "Imagine a video taken on a sunny beach, can a computer automatically tell what is happening in the scene? Can it identify different human activities in the video, such as water surfing, people walking and lying on the beach? To automatically classify or localize different actions in video sequences is very useful for a variety of tasks, such as video surveillance, objectlevel video summarization, video indexing, digital library organization, etc. However, it remains a challenging task for computers to achieve robust action recognition due to cluttered background, camera motion, occlusion, and geometric and photometric variances of objects. For example, in a live video of a skating competition, the skater moves rapidly across the rink, and the camera also moves to follow the skater. With moving camera, non-stationary background, and moving target, few vision algorithms could identify, categorize and localize such motions well. In addition, the challenge is even greater when there are multiple activities in a complex video sequence (Figure 1). We present a video demo for our novel unsupervised learning method for human action categories [1]. A video sequence is represented as a collection of spatial-temporal words by extracting space-time interest points. The algorithm learns the probability distributions of the spatial-temporal words and intermediate topics corresponding to human action categories automatically using a probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) model [4]. The learned model is then used for human action categorization and localization in a novel video, by maximizing the posterior of action category (topic) distributions. The contributions of this work are as follows: \u2022 Unsupervised learning of actions using \u2018video words\u2019 representation. We deploy a pLSA model with \u2018bag of video words\u2019 representation for video analysis; \u2022 Multiple action localization and categorization. Our approach is not only able to classify different actions, but also to localize different actions simultaneously in a novel and complex video sequence."

                "text": "Recognition of human actions is usually addressed in the scope of video interpretation. Meanwhile, common human actions such as ''reading a book'', ''playing a guitar'' or ''writing notes'' also provide a natural description for many still images. In addition, some actions in video such as ''taking a photograph'' are static by their nature and may require recognition methods based on static cues only. Motivated by the potential impact of recognizing actions in still images and the little attention this problem has received in computer vision so far, we address recognition of human actions in consumer photographs. We construct a new dataset available at http://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/stillactions/ with seven classes of actions in 911 Flickr images representing natural variations of human actions in terms of camera view-point, human pose, clothing, occlusions and scene background. We study action recognition in still images using the state-of-the-art bag-of-features methods as well as their combination with the part-based Latent SVM approach of Felzenszwalb et al. In particular, we investigate the role of background scene context and demonstrate that improved action recognition performance can be achieved by (i) combining the statistical and part-based representations, and (ii) integrating person-centric description with the background scene context. We show results on our newly collected dataset of seven common actions as well as demonstrate improved performance over existing methods on the datasets of Gupta et al. and Yao and Fei-Fei."

These challenges may weaken the effectiveness of a dedicated target observation model even based on multiple cues, which demands for an agile framework to adjust target observation models dynamically to maintain their discriminative power. Towards this end, we propose a new adaptive way to integrate multi-cue in tracking multiple human driven by human detections. Given a human detection can be reliably associated with an existing trajectory, we adapt the way how to combine specifically devised models based on different cues in this tracker so as to enhance the discriminative power of the integrated observation model in its local neighborhood. This is achieved by solving a regression problem efficiently. Specifically, we employ 3 observation models for a single person tracker based on color models of part of torso regions, an elliptical head model, and bags of local features, respectively. Extensive experiments on 3 challenging surveillance datasets demonstrate long-term reliable tracking performance of this method."

In particular, the study on detecting human-related video events in complex scenes with both a crowd of people and dynamic motion is still limited. In this paper, we investigate detecting video events that involve elementary human actions, e.g. making cellphone call, putting an object down, and pointing to something, in complex scenes using a novel spatio-temporal descriptor based approach. A new spatio-temporal descriptor, which temporally integrates the statistics of a set of response maps of low-level features, e.g. image gradients and optical flows, in a space-time cube, is proposed to capture the characteristics of actions in terms of their appearance and motion patterns. Based on this kind of descriptors, the bag-of-words method is utilized to describe a human figure as a concise feature vector. Then, these features are employed to train SVM classifiers at multiple spatial pyramid levels to distinguish different actions. Finally, a Gaussian kernel based temporal filtering is conducted to segment the sequences of events from a video stream taking account of the temporal consistency of actions. The proposed approach is capable of tolerating spatial layout variations and local deformations of human actions due to diverse view angles and rough human figure alignment in complex scenes. Extensive experiments on the 50-hour video dataset of TRECVid 2008 event detection task demonstrate that our approach outperforms the well-known SIFT descriptor based methods and effectively detects video events in challenging real-world conditions."

A large dataset comprising stereo image pairs of 50 uniform-colored toys under 36 azimuths, 9 elevations, and 6 lighting conditions was collected (for a total of 194,400 individual images). The objects were 10 instances of 5 generic categories: four-legged animals, human figures, airplanes, trucks, and cars. Five instances of each category were used for training, and the other five for testing. Low-resolution grayscale images of the objects with various amounts of variability and surrounding clutter were used for training and testing. Nearest neighbor methods, support vector machines, and convolutional networks, operating on raw pixels or on PCA-derived features were tested. Test error rates for unseen object instances placed on uniform backgrounds were around 13% for SVM and 7% for convolutional nets. On a segmentation/recognition task with highly cluttered images, SVM proved impractical, while convolutional nets yielded 16/7% error. A real-time version of the system was implemented that can detect and classify objects in natural scenes at around 10 frames per second."

In contrast to the previous work studying human actions in controlled settings, here we train and test algorithms on real movies with substantial variation of actions in terms of subject appearance, motion, surrounding scenes, viewing angles and spatio-temporal extents. We introduce a new annotated human action dataset and use it to evaluate several existing methods. We in particular focus on boosted space-time window classifiers and introduce \"keyframe priming\" that combines discriminative models of human motion and shape within an action. Keyframe priming is shown to significantly improve the performance of action detection.

We introduce a novel motion descriptor based on optical flow measurements in a spatiotemporal volume for each stabilized human figure, and an associated similarity measure to be used in a nearest-neighbor framework. Making use of noisy optical flow measurements is the key challenge, which is addressed by treating optical flow not as precise pixel displacements, but rather as a spatial pattern of noisy measurements which are carefully smoothed and aggregated to form our spatiotemporal motion descriptor. To classify the action being performed by a human figure in a query sequence, we retrieve nearest neighbor(s) from a database of stored, annotated video sequences. We can also use these retrieved exemplars to transfer 2D/3D skeletons onto the figures in the query sequence, as well as two forms of data-based action synthesis \"do as I do\" and \"do as I say\". Results are demonstrated on ballet, tennis as well as football datasets."

We demonstrate this approach on the challenging problem of natural image denoising. Using a test set with a hundred natural images, we find that convolutional networks provide comparable and in some cases superior performance to state of the art wavelet and Markov random field (MRF) methods. Moreover, we find that a convolutional network offers similar performance in the blind de-noising setting as compared to other techniques in the non-blind setting. We also show how convolutional networks are mathematically related to MRF approaches by presenting a mean field theory for an MRF specially designed for image denoising. Although these approaches are related, convolutional networks avoid computational difficulties in MRF approaches that arise from probabilistic learning and inference. This makes it possible to learn image processing architectures that have a high degree of representational power (we train models with over 15,000 parameters), but whose computational expense is significantly less than that associated with inference in MRF approaches with even hundreds of parameters."

Recently a greedy layer-wise procedure was proposed to initialize weights of deep belief networks, by viewing each layer as a separate restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). We develop the convolutional RBM (C-RBM), a variant of the RBM model in which weights are shared to respect the spatial structure of images. This framework learns a set of features that can generate the images of a specific object class. Our feature extraction model is a four layer hierarchy of alternating filtering and maximum subsampling. We learn feature parameters of the first and third layers viewing them as separate C-RBMs. The outputs of our feature extraction hierarchy are then fed as input to a discriminative classifier. It is experimentally demonstrated that the extracted features are effective for object detection, using them to obtain performance comparable to the state of the art on handwritten digit recognition and pedestrian detection."

Here we show that they can also be used as a general method for low-level image processing. As an example of our approach, convolutional networks are trained using gradient learning to solve the problem of restoring noisy or degraded images. For our training data, we have used electron microscopic images of neural circuitry with ground truth restorations provided by human experts. On this dataset, Markov random field (MRF), conditional random field (CRF), and anisotropic diffusion algorithms perform about the same as simple thresholding, but superior performance is obtained with a convolutional network containing over 34,000 adjustable parameters. When restored by this convolutional network, the images are clean enough to be used for segmentation, whereas the other approaches fail in this respect. We do not believe that convolutional networks are fundamentally superior to MRFs as a representation for image processing algorithms. On the contrary, the two approaches are closely related. But in practice, it is possible to train complex convolutional networks, while even simple MRF models are hindered by problems with Bayesian learning and inference procedures. Our results suggest that high model complexity is the single most important factor for good performance, and this is possible with convolutional networks."

However, to our knowledge, these deep learning approaches have not been extensively studied for auditory data. In this paper, we apply convolutional deep belief networks to audio data and empirically evaluate them on various audio classification tasks. In the case of speech data, we show that the learned features correspond to phones/phonemes. In addition, our feature representations learned from unlabeled audio data show very good performance for multiple audio classification tasks. We hope that this paper will inspire more research on deep learning approaches applied to a wide range of audio recognition tasks."

We refine the approach in several biologically plausible ways. Sparsity is increased by constraining the number of feature inputs, lateral inhibition, and feature selection. We also demonstrate the value of retaining some position and scale information above the intermediate feature level. Our final model is competitive with current computer vision algorithms on several standard datasets, including the Caltech 101 object categories and the UIUC car localization task. The results further the case for biologically-motivated approaches to object classification."

Scaling such models to full-sized, high-dimensional images remains a difficult problem. To address this problem, we present the convolutional deep belief network, a hierarchical generative model which scales to realistic image sizes. This model is translation-invariant and supports efficient bottom-up and top-down probabilistic inference. Key to our approach is probabilistic max-pooling, a novel technique which shrinks the representations of higher layers in a probabilistically sound way. Our experiments show that the algorithm learns useful high-level visual features, such as object parts, from unlabeled images of objects and natural scenes. We demonstrate excellent performance on several visual recognition tasks and show that our model can perform hierarchical (bottom-up and top-down) inference over full-sized images."

We demonstrate the strength of the approach on a range of recognition tasks: From invariant single object recognition in clutter to multiclass categorization problems and complex scene understanding tasks that rely on the recognition of both shape-based as well as texture-based objects. Given the biological constraints that the system had to satisfy, the approach performs surprisingly well: It has the capability of learning from only a few training examples and competes with state-of-the-art systems. We also discuss the existence of a universal, redundant dictionary of features that could handle the recognition of most object categories. In addition to its relevance for computer vision, the success of this approach suggests a plausibility proof for a class of feedforward models of object recognition in cortex"

The resulting feature extractor consists of multiple convolution filters, followed by a feature-pooling layer that computes the max of each filter output within adjacent windows, and a point-wise sigmoid non-linearity. A second level of larger and more invariant features is obtained by training the same algorithm on patches of features from the first level. Training a supervised classifier on these features yields 0.64% error on MNIST, and 54% average recognition rate on Caltech 101 with 30 training samples per category. While the resulting architecture is similar to convolutional networks, the layer-wise unsupervised training procedure alleviates the over-parameterization problems that plague purely supervised learning procedures, and yields good performance with very few labeled training samples."

The use of such features makes the problem more manageable while providing increased robustness to noise and pose variation. In this work we develop an extension of these ideas to the spatio-temporal case. For this purpose, we show that the direct 3D counterparts to commonly used 2D interest point detectors are inadequate, and we propose an alternative. Anchoring off of these interest points, we devise a recognition algorithm based on spatio-temporally windowed data. We present recognition results on a variety of datasets including both human and rodent behavior."

Most systems use only one stage of feature extraction in which the filters are hard-wired, or two stages where the filters in one or both stages are learned in supervised or unsupervised mode. This paper addresses three questions: 1. How does the non-linearities that follow the filter banks influence the recognition accuracy? 2. does learning the filter banks in an unsupervised or supervised manner improve the performance over random filters or hardwired filters? 3. Is there any advantage to using an architecture with two stages of feature extraction, rather than one? We show that using non-linearities that include rectification and local contrast normalization is the single most important ingredient for good accuracy on object recognition benchmarks. We show that two stages of feature extraction yield better accuracy than one. Most surprisingly, we show that a two-stage system with random filters can yield almost 63% recognition rate on Caltech-101, provided that the proper non-linearities and pooling layers are used. Finally, we show that with supervised refinement, the system achieves state-of-the-art performance on NORB dataset (5.6%) and unsupervised pre-training followed by supervised refinement produces good accuracy on Caltech-101 (\u226b 65%), and the lowest known error rate on the undistorted, unprocessed MNIST dataset (0.53%)."

The entire network is trained jointly on all these tasks using weight-sharing, an instance of multitask learning. All the tasks use labeled data except the language model which is learnt from unlabeled text and represents a novel form of semi-supervised learning for the shared tasks. We show how both multitask learning and semi-supervised learning improve the generalization of the shared tasks, resulting in state-of-the-art-performance."

Oddball paradigms are used in BCI to generate event-related potentials (ERPs), like the P300 wave, on targets selected by the user. A P300 speller is based on this principle, where the detection of P300 waves allows the user to write characters. The P300 speller is composed of two classification problems. The first classification is to detect the presence of a P300 in the electroencephalogram (EEG). The second one corresponds to the combination of different P300 responses for determining the right character to spell. A new method for the detection of P300 waves is presented. This model is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). The topology of the network is adapted to the detection of P300 waves in the time domain. Seven classifiers based on the CNN are proposed: four single classifiers with different features set and three multiclassifiers. These models are tested and compared on the Data set II of the third BCI competition. The best result is obtained with a multiclassifier solution with a recognition rate of 95.5 percent, without channel selection before the classification. The proposed approach provides also a new way for analyzing brain activities due to the receptive field of the CNN models."

Given an appropriate network architecture, Gradient-Based Learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional Neural Networks, that are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation, recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called Graph Transformer Networks (GTN), allows such multi-module systems to be trained globally using Gradient-Based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for on-line handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of Graph Transformer Networks. A Graph Transformer Network for reading bank check is also described. It uses Convolutional Neural Network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provides record accuracy on business and personal checks. It is deployed commercially and reads several million checks per day."

Our system's architecture is motivated by a quantitative model of visual cortex. We show that our approach exhibits excellent recognition performance and outperforms several state-of-the-art systems on a variety of image datasets including many different object categories. We also demonstrate that our system is able to learn from very few examples. The performance of the approach constitutes a suggestive plausibility proof for a class of feedforward models of object recognition in cortex."

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

We present a machine learning approach to computing an affinity graph using a convolutional network (CN) trained using ground truth provided by human experts. The CN affinity graph can be paired with any standard partitioning algorithm and improves segmentation accuracy significantly compared to standard hand-designed affinity functions. We apply our algorithm to the challenging 3D segmentation problem of reconstructing neuronal processes from volumetric electron microscopy (EM) and show that we are able to learn a good affinity graph directly from the raw EM images. Further, we show that our affinity graph improves the segmentation accuracy of both simple and sophisticated graph partitioning algorithms. In contrast to previous work, we do not rely on prior knowledge in the form of hand-designed image features or image preprocessing. Thus, we expect our algorithm to generalize effectively to arbitrary image types."

We argue that in order to progress toward this goal, the Machine Learning community must endeavor to discover algorithms that can learn highly complex functions, with minimal need for prior knowledge, and with minimal human intervention. We present mathematical and empirical evidence suggesting that many popular approaches to non-parametric learning, particularly kernel methods, are fundamentally limited in their ability to learn complex high-dimensional functions. Our analysis focuses on two problems. First, kernel machines are shallow architectures, in which one large layer of simple template matchers is followed by a single layer of trainable coefficients. We argue that shallow architectures can be very inefficient in terms of required number of computational elements and examples. Second, we analyze a limitation of kernel machines with a local kernel, linked to the curse of dimensionality, that applies to supervised, unsupervised (manifold learning) and semi-supervised kernel machines. Using empirical results on invariant image recognition tasks, kernel methods are compared with deep architectures, in which lower-level features or concepts are progressively combined into more abstract and higher-level representations. We argue that deep architectures have the potential to generalize in non-local ways, i.e., beyond immediate neighbors, and that this is crucial in order to make progress on the kind of complex tasks required for artificial intelligence."

                "text": "This paper addresses recognition of human actions under view changes. We explore self-similarities of action sequences over time and observe the striking stability of such measures across views. Building upon this key observation, we develop an action descriptor that captures the structure of temporal similarities and dissimilarities within an action sequence. Despite this temporal self-similarity descriptor not being strictly view-invariant, we provide intuition and experimental validation demonstrating its high stability under view changes. Self-similarity descriptors are also shown to be stable under performance variations within a class of actions when individual speed fluctuations are ignored. If required, such fluctuations between two different instances of the same action class can be explicitly recovered with dynamic time warping, as will be demonstrated, to achieve cross-view action synchronization. More central to the current work, temporal ordering of local self-similarity descriptors can simply be ignored within a bag-of-features type of approach. Sufficient action discrimination is still retained in this way to build a view-independent action recognition system. Interestingly, self-similarities computed from different image features possess similar properties and can be used in a complementary fashion. Our method is simple and requires neither structure recovery nor multiview correspondence estimation. Instead, it relies on weak geometric properties and combines them with machine learning for efficient cross-view action recognition. The method is validated on three public data sets. It has similar or superior performance compared to related methods and it performs well even in extreme conditions, such as when recognizing actions from top views while using side views only for training."

We propose to extend the notion of spatial interest points into the spatio-temporal domain and show how the resulting features often reflect interesting events that can be used for a compact representation of video data as well as for its interpretation. To detect spatio-temporal events, we build on the idea of the Harris and Forstner interest point operators and detect local structures in space-time where the image values have significant local variations in both space and time. We then estimate the spatio-temporal extents of the detected events and compute their scale-invariant spatio-temporal descriptors. Using such descriptors, we classify events and construct video representation in terms of labeled space-time points. For the problem of human motion analysis, we illustrate how the proposed method allows for detection of walking people in scenes with occlusions and dynamic backgrounds."

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind."

Deep architectures are composed of multiple levels of non-linear operations, such as in neural nets with many hidden layers or in complicated propositional formulae re-using many sub-formulae. Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult optimization task, but learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks have recently been proposed to tackle this problem with notable success, beating the state-of-the-art in certain areas.

This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

As a rule the number of handwritten symbols, number of phonemes or number of human faces are of the order of some dozens. But sometimes the pattern recognition task demands much more classes. For example, a continuous speech recognition system can be created on the base of syllables; a handwriting recognition system will be more efficient if the recognized units are not different letters, but triplets of letters. In these cases it is necessary to have various thousands of classes. In this paper we will consider the situation of the recognition problem that demands many thousands of classes to be recognized. For such problems we propose the use of the neural networks with ensembles. We give a short description of this type of neural network and calculate its storage capacity."

The network is self-organized by \u201clearning without a teacher\u201d, and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname \u201cneocognitron\u201d. After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consits of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of \u201cS-cells\u201d, which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of \u201cC-cells\u201d similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any \u201cteacher\u201d during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cell of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern."

We also introduced the related notion of a \"pseudo-loss\" which is a method for forcing a learning algorithm of multi-label concepts to concentrate on the labels that are hardest to discriminate. In this paper, we describe experiments we carried out to assess how well AdaBoost with and without pseudo-loss, performs on real learning problems. We performed two sets of experiments. The first set compared boosting to Breiman's \"bagging\" method when used to aggregate various classifiers (including decision trees and single attribute- value tests). We compared the performance of the two methods on a collection of machine-learning benchmarks. In the second set of experiments, we studied in more detail the performance of boosting using a nearest-neighbor classifier on an OCR problem."

An experimental comparison of various classifier combination schemes demonstrates that the combination rule developed under the most restrictive assumptions-the sum rule-and its derivatives consistently outperform other classifier combinations schemes. A sensitivity analysis of the various schemes to estimation errors is carried out to show that this finding can be justified theoretically."

The aggregation averages over the versions when predicting a numerical outcome and does a plurality vote when predicting a class. The multiple versions are formed by making bootstrap replicates of the learning set and using these as new learning sets. Tests on real and simulated data sets using classification and regression trees and subset selection in linear regression show that bagging can give substantial gains in accuracy. The vital element is the instability of the prediction method. If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy."

During training the two sub-networks extract features from two signatures, while the joining neuron measures the distance between the two feature vectors. Verification consists of comparing an extracted feature vector with a stored feature vector for the signer. Signatures closer to this stored representation than a chosen threshold are accepted, all other signatures are rejected as forgeries."
