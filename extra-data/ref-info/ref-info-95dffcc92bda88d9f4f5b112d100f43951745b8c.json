This method is based on the analysis of the background white space that surrounds the printed regions on the page. It does not make any assumptions about the shape of the regions as opposed to most earlier approaches which assume that printed regions are rectangular. It is capable of identifying and describing regions of complex shapes more accurately than existing methods. It requires no a priori knowledge. The background white space is covered with tiles and the contour of each region is identified by tracing through these white tiles that encircle it. The method can segment page images with severe skew without skew correction. The white tiles on the image can also be used in subsequent document analysis processes such as the classification of the image regions."

Many different zoning techniques are now available but there is no robust method available to benchmark and evaluate them reliably. Our proposed strategy is a region-based approach, in which segmentation results are compared with manually generated \"ground truth files\", describing all possible correct segmentations. A segmentation ground truthing scheme has been proposed. The evaluation of segmentation quality is achieved by testing the overlap between the two sets of regions. In fact, the regions are defined as the \"black\" pixels contained in the extracted polygons. An explicit specification of segmentation errors and a numerical evaluation are derived. The algorithm is simple and fast, and provides a multi-level output for each segmentation.<<ETX>>"

The principal parts of the algorithm are the generation of connected components and the application of the Hough transform in order to group components into logical character strings that can then be separated from the graphics. The algorithm outputs two images, one containing text strings and the other graphics. These images can then be processed by suitable character recognition and graphics recognition systems. The performance of the algorithm, both in terms of its effectiveness and computational efficiency, was evaluated using several test images and showed superior performance compared to other techniques. >"

Misclassifications, splitting, and merging of regions are among the errors that are detected by the system. Each error is weighted individually for a particular application and a global estimate of segmentation quality is derived. The system can be customized to benchmark specific aspects of segmentation (e.g., headline detection) and according to the type of error correction that might follow (e.g., re-typing). Segmentation ground-truth files are quickly and easily generated and edited using GroundsKeeper, an X-Window based tool that allows one to view a document, manually draw regions (arbitrary polygons) on it, and specify information about each region (e.g., type, parent)."

Additional information on compression and profiles was also used. Pixel-level information is required as input whether the analyzing tool is an expert system or something else. The issues covered are: (1) Profile characteristics of document objects like text, line drawings, tables, and half-tones, and the variation of these profiles with block size, type size, and direction of scan. (2) Speckle noise: sizes and distribution. (3) For the hierarchical (syntactic) approach, number of tree nodes at each level along with their areas, and comparison with node areas derived from transition-cut trees. (4) CCITT-Group 4 compression statistics on document sub-blocks and whole pages. (5) Size of postscript files and postscript commands used in printing these page files.

It permits efficient compression of a variety of signals, such as sound and images. The predefined libraries of modulated waveforms include orthogonal wavelet-packets and localized trigonometric functions, and have reasonably well-controlled time-frequency localization properties. The idea is to build out of the library functions an orthonormal basis relative to which the given signal or collection of signals has the lowest information cost. The method relies heavily on the remarkable orthogonality properties of the new libraries: all expansions in a given library conserve energy and are thus comparable. Several cost functionals are useful; one of the most attractive is Shannon entropy, which has a geometric interpretation in this context. >"
