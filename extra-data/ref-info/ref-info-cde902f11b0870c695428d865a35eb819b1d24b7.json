(2011) introduced an approach to grounded language learning based on unsupervised PCFG induction. Their approach works well when each sentence potentially refers to one of a small set of possible meanings, such as in the sportscasting task. However, it does not scale to problems with a large set of potential meanings for each sentence, such as the navigation instruction following task studied by Chen and Mooney (2011). This paper presents an enhancement of the PCFG approach that scales to such problems with highly-ambiguous supervision. Experimental results on the navigation task demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach."

We present a system that learns to transform natural-language navigation instructions into executable formal plans. Given no prior linguistic knowledge, the system learns by simply observing how humans follow navigation instructions. The system is evaluated in three complex virtual indoor environments with numerous objects and landmarks. A previously collected realistic corpus of complex English navigation instructions for these environments is used for training and testing data. By using a learned lexicon to refine inferred plans and a supervised learner to induce a semantic parser, the system is able to automatically learn to correctly interpret a reasonable fraction of the complex instructions in this corpus."

Providing this supervision is a major bottleneck in scaling semantic parsers. This paper presents a new learning paradigm aimed at alleviating the supervision burden. We develop two novel learning algorithms capable of predicting complex structures which only rely on a binary feedback signal based on the context of an external world. In addition we reformulate the semantic parsing problem to reduce the dependency of the model on syntactic patterns, thus allowing our parser to scale better using less supervision. Our results surprisingly show that without using any annotated meaning representations learning with a weak feedback signal is capable of producing a parser that is competitive with fully supervised parsers."

It is especially important in language grounding where the training data usually consist of language paired with an ambiguous perceptual context. Recent work by Chen and Mooney (2011) introduced a lexicon learning method that deals with ambiguous relational data by taking intersections of graphs. While the algorithm produced good lexicons for the task of learning to interpret navigation instructions, it only works in batch settings and does not scale well to large datasets. In this paper we introduce a new online algorithm that is an order of magnitude faster and surpasses the state-of-the-art results. We show that by changing the grammar of the formal meaning representation language and training on additional data collected from Amazon's Mechanical Turk we can further improve the results. We also include experimental results on a Chinese translation of the training data to demonstrate the generality of our approach."

We are interested in providing a way for a human teacher to interact with an automated learner using natural instructions, thus allowing the teacher to communicate the relevant domain expertise to the learner without necessarily knowing anything about the internal representations used in the learning process.In this paper we suggest to view the process of learning a decision function as a natural language lesson interpretation problem, as opposed to learning from labeled examples. This view of machine learning is motivated by human learning processes, in which the learner is given a lesson describing the target concept directly and a few instances exemplifying it. We introduce a learning algorithm for the lesson interpretation problem that receives feedback from its performance on the final task, while learning jointly (1) how to interpret the lesson and (2) how to use this interpretation to do well on the final task. traditional machine learning by focusing on supplying the learner only with information that can be provided by a task expert.We evaluate our approach by applying it to the rules of the solitaire card game. We show that our learning approach can eventually use natural language instructions to learn the target concept and play the game legally. Furthermore, we show that the learned semantic interpreter also generalizes to previously unseen instructions."

Our key observation is that multiple forms of weak supervision can be combined to train an accurate semantic parser: semantic supervision from a knowledge base, and syntactic supervision from dependency-parsed sentences. We apply our approach to train a semantic parser that uses 77 relations from Freebase in its knowledge representation. This semantic parser extracts instances of binary relations with state-of-the-art accuracy, while simultaneously recovering much richer semantic structures, such as conjunctions of multiple relations with partially shared arguments. We demonstrate recovery of this richer structure by extracting logical forms from natural language queries against Freebase. On this task, the trained semantic parser achieves 80% precision and 56% recall, despite never having seen an annotated logical form."

When something goes wrong, a system can ask for clarification, rewording, or otherwise redirect the interaction to achieve its goals. In this paper, we present an approach for using conversational interactions of this type to induce semantic parsers. We demonstrate learning without any explicit annotation of the meanings of user utterances. Instead, we model meaning with latent variables, and introduce a loss function to measure how well potential meanings match the conversation. This loss drives the overall learning approach, which induces a weighted CCG grammar that could be used to automatically bootstrap the semantic analysis component in a complete dialog system. Experiments on DARPA Communicator conversational logs demonstrate effective learning, despite requiring no explicit meaning annotations."

Recently, this has led to study of the language grounding problem, where the goal is to extract representations of the meanings of natural language tied to the physical world. We present an approach for joint learning of language and perception models for grounded attribute induction. The perception model includes classifiers for physical characteristics and a language model based on a probabilistic categorial grammar that enables the construction of compositional meaning representations. We evaluate on the task of interpreting sentences that describe sets of objects in a physical workspace, and demonstrate accurate task performance and effective latent-variable concept induction in physical grounded scenes."

In response, unconstrained natural-language interaction with robots has emerged as a significant research area. We discuss the problem of parsing natural language commands to actions and control structures that can be readily implemented in a robot execution system. Our approach learns a parser based on example pairs of English commands and corresponding control language expressions. We evaluate this approach in the context of following route instructions through an indoor environment, and demonstrate that our system can learn to translate English commands into sequences of desired actions, while correctly capturing the semantic intent of statements involving complex control structures. The procedural nature of our formal representation allows a robot to interpret route instructions online while moving through a previously unknown environment."

The core part of such a system is the semantic parser that maps questions to logical forms. Semantic parsers are typically trained from examples of questions annotated with their target logical forms, but this type of annotation is expensive.Our goal is to instead learn a semantic parser from question\u2013answer pairs, where the logical form is modeled as a latent variable. We develop a new semantic formalism, dependency-based compositional semantics (DCS) and define a log-linear distribution over DCS logical forms. The model parameters are estimated using a simple procedure that alternates between beam search and numerical optimization. On two standard semantic parsing benchmarks, we show that our system obtains comparable accuracies to even state-of-the-art systems that do require annotated logical forms."

We assume access to a reward function that defines the quality of the executed actions. During training, the learner repeatedly constructs action sequences for a set of documents, executes those actions, and observes the resulting reward. We use a policy gradient algorithm to estimate the parameters of a log-linear model for action selection. We apply our method to interpret instructions in two domains --- Windows troubleshooting guides and game tutorials. Our results demonstrate that this method can rival supervised learning techniques while requiring few or no annotated training examples."

Traditional CCG lexicons list lexical items that pair words and phrases with syntactic and semantic content. Such lexicons can be inefficient when words appear repeatedly with closely related lexical content. In this paper, we introduce factored lexicons, which include both lexemes to model word meaning and templates to model systematic variation in word usage. We also present an algorithm for learning factored CCG lexicons, along with a probabilistic parse-selection model. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the approach learns highly accurate parsers, whose generalization performance benefits greatly from the lexical factoring."

We present MARCO, an agent that follows free-form, natural language route instructions by representing and executing a sequence of compound action specifications that model which actions to take under which conditions. MARCO infers implicit actions from knowledge of both linguistic conditional phrases and from spatial action and local configurations. Thus, MARCO performs explicit actions, implicit actions necessary to achieve the stated conditions, and exploratory actions to learn about the world. \n \nWe gathered a corpus of 786 route instructions from six people in three large-scale virtual indoor environments. Thirtysix other people followed these instructions and rated them for quality. These human participants finished at the intended destination on 69% of the trials. MARCO followed the same instructions in the same environments, with a success rate of 61%. We measured the efficacy of action inference with MARCO variants lacking action inference: executing only explicit actions, MARCO succeeded on just 28% of the trials. For this task, inferring implicit actions is essential to follow poor instructions, but is also crucial for many highly-rated route instructions."

We demonstrate its capabilities by developing a system that learns to sportscast simulated robot soccer games in both English and Korean without any language-specific prior knowledge. Training employs only ambiguous supervision consisting of a stream of descriptive textual comments and a sequence of events extracted from the simulation trace. The system simultaneously establishes correspondences between individual comments and the events that they describe while building a translation model that supports both parsing and generation. We also present a novel algorithm for learning which events are worth describing. Human evaluations of the generated commentaries indicate they are of reasonable quality and in some cases even on par with those produced by humans for our limited domain."

We will discuss our approach, which includes an action representation formalism based on Conceptual Structures [Jac90], and the construction of the structure of the agent's intentions.

Previous approaches have been designed for particular natural languages or specific meaning representations; here we present a more general method. The approach induces a probabilistic CCG grammar that represents the meaning of individual words and defines how these meanings can be combined to analyze complete sentences. We use higher-order unification to define a hypothesis space containing all grammars consistent with the training data, and develop an online learning algorithm that efficiently searches this space while simultaneously estimating the parameters of a log-linear parsing model. Experiments demonstrate high accuracy on benchmark data sets in four languages with two different meaning representations."

This dissertation demonstrates a software agent that parses, models and executes human-written natural language instructions to accomplish complex navigation tasks. We compare the performance against people following the same instructions. By selectively removing various syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic abilities, this work empirically measures how often these abilities are necessary to correctly navigate along extended routes through unknown, large-scale environments to novel destinations. \nTo study how route instructions are written and followed, this work presents a new corpus of 1520 free-form instructions from 30 directors for 252 routes in three virtual environments. 101 other people followed these instructions and rated them for quality, successfully reaching and identifying the destination on only approximately two-thirds of the trials. Our software agent, M ARCO, followed the same instructions in the same environments with a success rate approaching human levels. Overall, instructions subjectively rated 4 or better of 6 comprise just over half of the corpus; MARCO performs at 88% of human performance on these instructions. M ARCO's performance was a strong predictor of human performance and ratings of individual instructions. Ablation experiments demonstrate that implicit procedures are crucial for following verbal instructions using an approach integrating language, knowledge and action. Other experiments measure the performance impact of linguistic, execution, and spatial abilities in successfully following natural language route instructions."

In this paper, we describe an integrated robotic architecture that can achieve the above steps by translating natural language instructions incrementally and simultaneously into formal logical goal description and action languages, which can be used both to reason about the achievability of a goal as well as to generate new action scripts to pursue the goal. We demonstrate the implementation of our approach on a robot taking spoken natural language instructions in an office environment."

In this work we investigate how statistical machine translation techniques can be used to bridge the gap between natural language route instructions and a map of an environment built by a robot. Our approach uses training data to learn to translate from natural language instructions to an automatically-labeled map. The complexity of the translation process is controlled by taking advantage of physical constraints imposed by the map. As a result, our technique can efficiently handle uncertainty in both map labeling and parsing. Our experiments demonstrate the promising capabilities achieved by our approach."

Previous approaches have used models with fixed structure to infer the likelihood of a sequence of actions given the environment and the command. In contrast, our framework, called Generalized Grounding Graphs (G3), dynamically instantiates a probabilistic graphical model for a particular natural language command according to the command's hierarchical and compositional semantic structure. Our system performs inference in the model to successfully find and execute plans corresponding to natural language commands such as \"Put the tire pallet on the truck.\" The model is trained using a corpus of commands collected using crowdsourcing. We pair each command with robot actions and use the corpus to learn the parameters of the model. We evaluate the robot's performance by inferring plans from natural language commands, executing each plan in a realistic robot simulator, and asking users to evaluate the system's performance. We demonstrate that our system can successfully follow many natural language commands from the corpus."

These meaning representations approximate the contextual input available to the child; they do not specify the meanings of individual words or syntactic derivations. The learner then has to infer the meanings and syntactic properties of the words in the input along with a parsing model. We use the CCG grammatical framework and train a non-parametric Bayesian model of parse structure with online variational Bayesian expectation maximization. When tested on utterances from the CHILDES corpus, our learner outperforms a state-of-the-art semantic parser. In addition, it models such aspects of child acquisition as \"fast mapping,\" while also countering previous criticisms of statistical syntactic learners."

Understanding this kind of linguistic input is challenging because diverse words and phrases must be mapped into structures that the robot can understand, and elements in those structures must be grounded in an uncertain environment. We present a system that follows natural language directions by extracting a sequence of spatial description clauses from the linguistic input and then infers the most probable path through the environment given only information about the environmental geometry and detected visible objects. We use a probabilistic graphical model that factors into three key components. The first component grounds landmark phrases such as \u201cthe computers\u201d in the perceptual frame of the robot by exploiting co-occurrence statistics from a database of tagged images such as Flickr. Second, a spatial reasoning component judges how well spatial relations such as \u201cpast the computers\u201d describe a path. Finally, verb phrases such as \u201cturn right\u201d are modeled according to the amount of change in orientation in the path. Our system follows 60% of the directions in our corpus to within 15 meters of the true destination, significantly outperforming other approaches."

Our formulation uses a factorization analogous to the standard dynamic programs for parsing. In particular, it allows one to efficiently learn a model which discriminates among the entire space of parse trees, as opposed to reranking the top few candidates. Our models can condition on arbitrary features of input sentences, thus incorporating an important kind of lexical information without the added algorithmic complexity of modeling headedness. We provide an efficient algorithm for learning such models and show experimental evidence of the model\u2019s improved performance over a natural baseline model and a lexicalized probabilistic context-free grammar."

Where traditional models learn from linguistic annotation or word distributions, our approach is grounded in the world, learning by apprenticeship from routes through a map paired with English descriptions. Lacking an explicit alignment between the text and the reference path makes it difficult to determine what portions of the language describe which aspects of the route. We learn this correspondence with a reinforcement learning algorithm, using the deviation of the route we follow from the intended path as a reward signal. We demonstrate that our system successfully grounds the meaning of spatial terms like above and south into geometric properties of paths."

The system answers questions, executes commands, and accepts information in an interactive English dialog. It is based on the belief that in modeling language understanding, we must deal in an integrated way with all of the aspects of language\u2014syntax, semantics, and inference. The system contains a parser, a recognition grammar of English, programs for semantic analysis, and a general problem solving system. We assume that a computer cannot deal reasonably with language unless it can understand the subject it is discussing. Therefore, the program is given a detailed model of a particular domain. In addition, the system has a simple model of its own mentality. It can remember and discuss its plans and actions as well as carrying them out. It enters into a dialog with a person, responding to English sentences with actions and English replies, asking for clarification when its heuristic programs cannot understand a sentence through the use of syntactic, semantic, contextual, and physical knowledge. Knowledge in the system is represented in the form of procedures, rather than tables of rules or lists of patterns. By developing special procedural representations for syntax, semantics, and inference, we gain flexibility and power. Since each piece of knowledge can be a procedure, it can call directly on any other piece of knowledge in the system."

In this paper we describe a method for incorporating discourse-level triggers into a discriminative language model. Triggers are features identifying re-occurrence of words within a conversation. We introduce triggers that are specific to particular unigrams and bigrams, as well as \"back off\" trigger features that allow generalizations to be made across different unigrams. We train our model using a new loss-sensitive variant of the perceptron algorithm that makes effective use of information from multiple hypotheses in an n-best list. We train and test on the switchboard data set and show a 0.5 absolute reduction in WER over a baseline discriminative model which uses n-gram features alone, and a 1.5 absolute reduction in WER over the baseline recognizer."

When giving directions, people often make mistakes such as labelling errors (e.g., left vs. right) and errors of omission (skipping important decision points in a sequence). Furthermore, people often use multiple levels of granularity in specifying directions, referring to locations using single object landmarks, multiple landmarks in a given location, or identifying large regions as a single location. The challenge is to identify the correct path to a destination from a sequence of noisy, possibly erroneous directions. In our work we cast this problem as probabilistic inference: given a set of directions, an agent should automatically find the path with the geometry and physical appearance to maximize the likelihood of those directions. We use a specific variant of a Markov Random Field (MRF) to represent our model, and gather multi-granularity representation information using existing large tagged datasets. On a dataset of route directions collected in a large third floor university building, we found that our algorithm correctly inferred the true final destination in 47 out of the 55 cases successfully followed by humans volunteers. These results suggest that our algorithm is performing well relative to human users. In the future this work will be included in a broader system for autonomously constructing environmental representations that support natural human-robot interaction for direction giving."

                "text": "This article describes a number of log-linear parsing models for an automatically extracted lexicalized grammar. The models are full parsing models in the sense that probabilities are defined for complete parses, rather than for independent events derived by decomposing the parse tree. Discriminative training is used to estimate the models, which requires incorrect parses for each sentence in the training data as well as the correct parse. The lexicalized grammar formalism used is Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG), and the grammar is automatically extracted from CCGbank, a CCG version of the Penn Treebank. The combination of discriminative training and an automatically extracted grammar leads to a significant memory requirement (up to 25 GB), which is satisfied using a parallel implementation of the BFGS optimization algorithm running on a Beowulf cluster. Dynamic programming over a packed chart, in combination with the parallel implementation, allows us to solve one of the largest-scale estimation problems in the statistical parsing literature in under three hours. A key component of the parsing system, for both training and testing, is a Maximum Entropy supertagger which assigns CCG lexical categories to words in a sentence. The supertagger makes the discriminative training feasible, and also leads to a highly efficient parser. Surprisingly, given CCG's spurious ambiguity, the parsing speeds are significantly higher than those reported for comparable parsers in the literature. We also extend the existing parsing techniques for CCG by developing a new model and efficient parsing algorithm which exploits all derivations, including CCG's nonstandard derivations. This model and parsing algorithm, when combined with normal-form constraints, give state-of-the-art accuracy for the recovery of predicate-argument dependencies from CCGbank. The parser is also evaluated on DepBank and compared against the RASP parser, outperforming RASP overall and on the majority of relation types. The evaluation on DepBank raises a number of issues regarding parser evaluation. This article provides a comprehensive blueprint for building a wide-coverage CCG parser. We demonstrate that both accurate and highly efficient parsing is possible with CCG."

In the example of route instructions treated in this paper, the 15 primitives found include functions such as turn(), cross(), landmark_is_located(), etc. These are natural primitives of human behaviour but complex robot functions, some of which are not normally thought of by roboticists. Primitives must cope robustly with a variety of environmental conditions and require autonomous navigation capabilities based for instance on visual landmark recognition and localisation, navigable space mapping and path planning. Thus, the requirement of human-robot interaction creates specific and demanding functional targets for robot designers. A major obstacle to human-robot communication lies probably in current robots\u2019 perception capabilities. Furthermore, for human-robot communication to match the performance of human-human communication, the robot must also be provided with capabilities of re-interpreting and correcting instructions at execution time. Such a large autonomy raises wider issues of safety and control."

Coordination, relativization, and related prosodic phenomena have been analyzed in CCG in terms of a radically revised notion of surface structure. CCG surface structures do not exhibit traditional notions of syntactic dominance and command, and do not constitute an autonomous level of representation. Instead, they reflect the computations by which a sentence may be realized or analyzed, to synchronously define a predicate-argument structure, or logical form. Surface Structure and Interpretation shows that binding and control can be captured at this level, preserving the advantages of CCG as an account of coordination and unbounded dependency.The core of the book is a detailed treatment of extraction, a focus of syntactic research since the early work of Chomsky and Ross. The topics addressed include the sources of subject-object asymmetries and phenomena attributed to the Empty Category Principle (ECP), asymmetric islands, parasitic gaps, and the relation of coordination and extraction, including their interactions with binding theory. In his conclusion, the author relates CCG to other categorial and type-driven approaches and to proposals for minimalism in linguistic theory.Linguistic Inquiry Monograph No. 30"

It develops the view that the logical forms of simple English sentences typically contain quantification over events or states and shows how this view can account for a wide variety of semantic phenomena.Focusing on the structure of meaning in English sentences at a \"subatomic\" level - that is, a level below the one most theories accept as basic or \"atomic\" - Parsons asserts that the semantics of simple English sentences require logical forms somewhat more complex than is normally assumed in natural language semantics. His articulation of underlying event theory explains a wide variety of apparently diverse semantic characteristics of natural language, and his development of the theory shows the importance of seeing the distinction between events and states.Parsons demonstrates that verbs, also, indicate kinds of actions rather than specific, individual actions. Verb phrases, too, he argues, depend on modifiers to make their function and meaning in a sentence specific. An appendix gives many of the details needed to formalize the theory discussed in the body of the text and provides a series of templates that permit the generation of atomic formulas of English.Terence Parsons is Professor of Philosophy and Dean of Humanities at the University of California, Irvine."

The latter originated with Russell as an answer to the paradoxes, but has the additional virtue that it is very close to ordinary language. In fact, type theory is so much more similar to language than predicate logic is, that adopting it as a vehicle of representation can overcome the mismatches between grammatical form and predicate logical form that were observed by Frege and Russell. The grammatical forms of ordinary language sentences consequently may be taken to be much less misleading than logicians in the first half of the 20th century often thought them to be. This was realized by Richard Montague, who used the theory of types to translate fragments of ordinary language into a logical language. Semantics is commonly divided into lexical semantics, which studies the meaning of words, and compositional semantics, which studies the way in which complex phrases obtain a meaning from their constituents. The strength of type-logical semantics lies with the latter, but type-logical theories can be combined with many competing hypotheses about lexical meaning, provided these hypotheses are expressed using the language of type theory."

Conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."

Man can be aware that he selects human behaviour is such that E & 0 are not treated as identical man uses symbols to represent E & 0, etc . Consequences likely to result from identifying and confusing orders were illustrated by numerous examples . Projection and to-me-ness also came into this meeting's discussions . As a brief 'digression' it was discussed among members that human hunger for the static (something that does not change in a changing world) appears natural to man, and may be considered as a basic human urge ; and that many 'religions' might well be considered as expressions of this urge and attempts to satisfy a natural human hunger . It was pointed out that man appears to be endowed with the necessary mechanism or means to achieve satisfaction, and, provided man fulfills his human destiny, he will find satisfaction for this hunger but not if he 'walks the pre-scientific path through confusion to perdition .' For homework a sheet of paper was handed to each member with the following written thereon : At our next meeting we shall consider differences between sense and nonsense . Can you recognize nonsense when you come across it? Please deal with these 'questions' in writing, as briefly as you can and NOTE CAREFULLY HOW LONG YOU SPEND ON EACH . 1. What is the secret of success? 2. Can religion conquer communism? 3. Will Christianity survive? 4 . If the temperature of some water is 60 degrees Fahr . what is the temperature of the atoms of hydrogen and oxygen which go to make up that water? 5 . If the 3.24 from Victoria was two minutes late on Friday what is the point duty policeman's name? 6 . Should the death sentence be abolished? 7 . How long is a piece of string? 8. Can you think of any circumstances in which this recorded extract from a conversation might make sense? 'Then a screw nicks my snout and puts me in peter .' IV . It was felt as gratifying to the group leader to find that most of the members had treated nearly all the 'questions' as nonsense . Some had given a 'Roland for an Oliver' by making blatant nonsense remarks ; others had written remarks such as, 'I cannot answer the question until I know what you mean by . . .' A few, however, treated 'questions' 1,2,3, 6, as sense . With two exceptions the members labelled 8 as 'possibly underworld, spiv, or prison slang' . The leader interpreted the conversation extract thus 'Then a prison warder confiscated my tobacco and locked me in my cell .' Numbers 18 & 19, 1955-56 The relaxing effect of answered questions was contrasted with the continued states of tension arising from unanswered and unanswerable questions . An apple was passed around for the members to handle, smell, look at, feel. The apple was then placed in the centre of a diagram, adapted from O .R . Bontrager's diagram on page 5, G S BULLETIN 4 & 5 . The apple was labelled Apple, . The process of abstracting in higher orders was illustrated . For homework the members were asked to devise a diagram in a similar manner STARTING WITH AN ACTUAL OBJECT to place in the centre . It was intimated that at the next meeting we would continue our consideration of nonsense . This meeting was rounded off with the following reading from Shakespeare : (Macbeth, Act III, Sc . 1) First Murderer : We are men, my liege . Macbeth : Aye, in the catalogue ye go for men; as hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs, shoughs, water-rugs, and demiwolves, are slept all by the name of dogs : the valu'd file distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle, the housekeeper, the hunter, everyone according to the gift which bounteous nature hath in him clos'd ; whereby he does receive particular addition, from the bill that writes them all alike ; and so of men . V . At the fifth meeting, some diagrams were produced 'that appeared so excellent to the leader that they will be used at other courses in the place of his own crude drawings . With a general show of enthusiasm, we passed on to the main topic for this meeting, 'more nonsense' . The Plogglies story was read from Wendell Johnson's People in quandaries, and a brief resume given of the Brownian movement, also based on Wendell Johnson, pages 76, 71-72 . After this, a home-made model of the apparatus illustrated and described on page 73, G S BULLETIN 12 & 13, was demonstrated . _ 7"

The predominant approach in computational linguistics has been to use a parametric model with some variant of maximum-likelihood estimation. The assumptions under which maximum-likelihood estimation is justified are arguably quite strong. This chapter discusses the statistical theory underlying various parameter-estimation methods, and gives algorithms which depend on alternatives to (smoothed) maximum-likelihood estimation. We first give an overview of results from statistical learning theory. We then show how important concepts from the classification literature - specifically, generalization results based on margins on training data - can be derived for parsing models. Finally, we describe parameter estimation algorithms which are motivated by these generalization bounds."

Kernel-based approaches, such as support vector machines (SVMs), which maximize the margin of confidence of the classifier, are the method of choice for many such tasks. Their popularity stems both from the ability to use high-dimensional feature spaces, and from their strong theoretical guarantees. However, many real-world tasks involve sequential, spatial, or structured data, where multiple labels must be assigned. Existing kernel-based methods ignore structure in the problem, assigning labels independently to each object, losing much useful information. Conversely, probabilistic graphical models, such as Markov networks, can represent correlations between labels, by exploiting problem structure, but cannot handle high-dimensional feature spaces, and lack strong theoretical generalization guarantees. In this paper, we present a new framework that combines the advantages of both approaches: Maximum margin Markov (M3) networks incorporate both kernels, which efficiently deal with high-dimensional features, and the ability to capture correlations in structured data. We present an efficient algorithm for learning M3 networks based on a compact quadratic program formulation. We provide a new theoretical bound for generalization in structured domains. Experiments on the task of handwritten character recognition and collective hypertext classification demonstrate very significant gains over previous approaches."

Mostowski, 1957). Since then logicians have discovered and studied a large number of generalized quantifiers. At last count there were well over 200 research papers in this area. Most of this work has been directed toward cardinality quantifiers (e.g. Keisler, 1969) and topological quantifiers (e.g. Sgro, 1977) which are not particularly relevant to natural language, but even so, it has forced logicians to rethink the traditional theory of quantification."
