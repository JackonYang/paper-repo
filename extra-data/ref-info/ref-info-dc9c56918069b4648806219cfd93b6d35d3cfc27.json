The algorithm has two parts: first a row labeling algorithm groups similar rows into clusters then, a column labeling algorithm identifies the column structure within each cluster. Each column structure is identified by a set of column separation intervals that are computed from the intervals representing the extent of the white spacing between consecutive word fragments. We formally describe a method for finding column separation intervals based on word fragment separation intervals. This method is based on constructing a closure of a set of line intervals under the operation of line intersection. The closure is maintained dynamically in a data structure which facilitates easy access to the elements within the closure. This technique is computationally less expensive than projection and search at the pixel level since word fragment acquisition is already required for document recognition applications."

Each cell of a table is arranged regularly in two dimensions and is represented by a row-column pair. Even in the absence of ruled lines, its coordinates are explicitly found. Thus, it is assumed that an arrangement of textblocks defines the table structure, which is an arrangement of rows and columns, and ruled lines make clear their relationship. This process is composed of two procedures: the expansion of cell bounding boxes and the assignment of row-column numbers to each edge. It is shown that the method can be applied to partially ruled tables with some experimental results.<<ETX>>"

Several critical functions have been investigated and the technical approaches are discussed. The first is the segmentation and classification of digitized printed documents into regions of text and images. A nonlinear, run-length smoothing algorithm has been used for this purpose. By using the regular features of text lines, a linear adaptive classification scheme discriminates text regions from others. The second technique studied is an adaptive approach to the recognition of the hundreds of font styles and sizes that can occur on printed documents. A preclassifier is constructed during the input process and used to speed up a well-known pattern-matching method for clustering characters from an arbitrary print source into a small sample of prototypes. Experimental results are included."

While most research in the area of table analysis and recognition has focused on analyzing the raster image, our approach builds upon the advances in optical character recognition (OCR) software to preserve the layout of tabular data by means of white space. By using methods to analyze the geometry, syntax, and the semantics of the character data, as well as utilizing some well-known image processing techniques, we are able to 1) isolate embedded tables from documents, and 2) identify table components uch as title blocks, table entries, and footer blocks. Furthermore, the table analysis techniques presented in this paper can also be applied when analyzing blocks of text isolated by traditional methods such as connected component analysis[1] or bounding box [2]."

It is very important to be able to classify table and figure areas automatically. Furthermore, in tables, the column and row in which a character string is located are very important pieces of information. To detect and analyze table areas, the following method is applied: First, areas that may contain tables or figures are distinguished from text areas by the presence of horizontal and vertical lines. Next, the areas are assumed to be table areas and are analyzed as such. A judgment is made on whether each of the areas can in fact be a table area or not; in this way, the actual table areas are detected. Finally, the structures of the areas are analyzed and character strings in the areas are arranged by using the DP matching method. This method was applied to sixty-five pages of Japanese technical papers, magazines, manuals for software programs, and pages including 34 table areas, 48 line drawing areas, and 35 image areas. As a result, 96.6 percent of the areas were detected correctly and 91.7 percent of the tables were analyzed and arranged correctly."

Following the initial binarization and deskewing operations, the image is scanned to extract all horizontal and vertical lines that are present. The table's dimensions are estimated based on these lines. Unlike other systems, the procedure described does not depend on the sole existence of lines to mark the item blocks. White streams are recognized in both the horizontal and vertical direction as substitutes for any missing demarcation lines. A structure interpretation procedure uses the extracted demarcation information to identify each of the item blocks in the table. Subsequently, the interrelations of these item blocks are used to recognize the structure of the tabulated data.<<ETX>>"

This conversion process has some unique problems associated with it, these are discussed, along with our attempts to solve them. This system also establishes a mapping between the bitmap image and its corresponding ASCII representation that can be used to design flexible image-based interfaces for IR-related applications."
