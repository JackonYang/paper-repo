The method is based on local characteristics which are invariant to similarity transformations in the image. These characteristics are computed at automatically detected keypoints using the greyvalue signal. The method therefore works on images such as paintings for which geometry based recognition fails. Due to the locality of the method, images can be recognized being given part of an image and in the presence of occlusions. Applying a voting algorithm and semi-local constraints makes the method robust to noise, scene clutter and small perspective deformations. Experiments show an efficient recognition for different types of images. The approach has been validated on an image database containing 1020 images, some of them being very similar by structure, texture or shape."

The model uses probability distributions to characterize the significance, position, and intrinsic measurements of various discrete features of appearance; it also describes topological relations among features. The features and their distributions are learned from training images depicting the modeled object. A matching procedure, combining qualities of both alignment and graph subisomorphism methods, uses feature uncertainty information recorded by the model to guide the search for a match between model and image. Experiments show the method capable of learning to recognize complex objects in cluttered images, acquiring models that represent those objects using relatively few views."

An abstract theoretical framework is provided, which is suitable for automatic model generation from examples, identification, and localization of objects. Both, the learning and localization stage are formalized as parameter estimation tasks. The statistical learning phase is unsupervised with respect to the matching of model and scene features. The general mathematical description yields algorithms which can even treat parameter estimation problems from projected data. The experiments show that this probabilistic approach is suitable for solving 2D and 3D object recognition problems using grey-level images. The method can also be applied to 3D image processing issues using range images, i.e. 3D input data.<<ETX>>"

An object is represented by a set of high-dimensional iconic feature vectors comprised of the responses of derivatives of Gaussian filters at a range of orientations and scales. Since these filters can be shown to form the eigenvectors of arbitrary images containing both natural and man-made structures, they are well-suited for indexing in disparate domains. The indexing algorithm uses an active vision system in conjunction with a modified form of Kanerva's (1988, 1993) sparse distributed memory which facilitates interpolation between views and provides a convenient platform for learning the association between an object's appearance and its identity. The robustness of the indexing method was experimentally confirmed by subjecting the method to a range of viewing conditions and the accuracy was verified using a well-known model database containing a number of complex 3D objects under varying pose.<<ETX>>"

The capability of object recognition systems can be improved by also incorporating information about the color of object surfaces. We derive invariants of local color pixel distributions that are independent of viewpoint and the configuration, intensity, and spectral content of the scene illumination. These invariants capture information about the distribution of spectral reflectance which is intrinsic to a surface and thereby provide substantial discriminatory power for identifying a wide range of surfaces. These invariants can be computed efficiently from color image regions without requiring any form of segmentation. We have implemented an object recognition system that indexes into a database of models using the invariants and that uses associated geometric information for hypothesis verification and pose estimation. The approach to recognition is based on the computation of local invariants and is therefore relatively insensitive to occlusion. We present several examples demonstrating the system's ability to recognize model objects in cluttered scenes. The discriminatory power of the invariants has been demonstrated by the system's ability to process a large set of regions over complex scenes without generating false hypotheses.<<ETX>>"

                "text": "Severe architectural and timing constraints within the primate visual system support the conjecture that the early phase of object recognition in the brain is based on a feedforward feature-extraction hierarchy. To assess the plausibility of this conjecture in an engineering context, a difficult three-dimensional object recognition domain was developed to challenge a pure feedforward, receptive-field based recognition model called SEEMORE. SEEMORE is based on 102 viewpoint-invariant nonlinear filters that as a group are sensitive to contour, texture, and color cues. The visual domain consists of 100 real objects of many different types, including rigid (shovel), nonrigid (telephone cord), and statistical (maple leaf cluster) objects and photographs of complex scenes. Objects were in dividually presented in color video images under normal room lighting conditions. Based on 12 to 36 training views, SEEMORE was required to recognize unnormalized test views of objects that could vary in position, orientation in the image plane and in depth, and scale (factor of 2); for non rigid objects, recognition was also tested under gross shape deformations. Correct classification performance on a test set consisting of 600 novel object views was 97 percent (chance was 1 percent) and was comparable for the subset of 15 nonrigid objects. Performance was also measured under a variety of image degradation conditions, including partial occlusion, limited clutter, color shift, and additive noise. Generalization behavior and classification errors illustrate the emergence of several striking natural shape categories that are not explicitly encoded in the dimensions of the feature space. It is concluded that in the light of the vast hardware resources available in the ventral stream of the primate visual system relative to those exercised here, the appealingly simple feature-space conjecture remains worthy of serious consideration as a neurobiological model."

The model consists of three stages: (1) the image is convolved with a bank of even-symmetric linear filters followed by half-wave rectification to give a set of responses; (2) inhibition, localized in space, within and among the neural response profiles results in the suppression of weak responses when there are strong responses at the same or nearby locations; and (3) texture boundaries are detected using peaks in the gradients of the inhibited response profiles. The model is precisely specified, equally applicable to grey-scale and binary textures, and is motivated by detailed comparison with psychophysics and physiology. It makes predictions about the degree of discriminability of different texture pairs which match very well with experimental measurements of discriminability in human observers. From a machine-vision point of view, the scheme is a high-quality texture-edge detector which works equally on images of artificial and natural scenes. The algorithm makes the use of simple local and parallel operations, which makes it potentially real-time.<<ETX>>"

This approach goes beyond edge-based and area-based approaches by using a richer image description and incorporating several stereo cues that previously have been neglected in the computer vision literature. A technique based on using the pseudo-inverse is presented for characterizing the information present in a vector of filter responses. We show how in our framework viewing geometry can be recovered to determine the locations of epipolar lines. An assumption that visible surfaces in the scene are piecewise smooth leads to differential treatment of image regions corresponding to binocularly visible surfaces, surface boundaries, and occluded regions that are only monocularly visible. The constraints imposed by viewing geometry and piecewise smoothness are incorporated into an iterative algorithm that gives good results on random-dot stereograms, artificially generated scenes, and natural grey-level images."

                "text": "The problem of automatically learning object models for recognition and pose estimation is addressed. In contrast to the traditional approach, the recognition problem is formulated as one of matching appearance rather than shape. The appearance of an object in a two-dimensional image depends on its shape, reflectance properties, pose in the scene, and the illumination conditions. While shape and reflectance are intrinsic properties and constant for a rigid object, pose and illumination vary from scene to scene. A compact representation of object appearance is proposed that is parametrized by pose and illumination. For each object of interest, a large set of images is obtained by automatically varying pose and illumination. This image set is compressed to obtain a low-dimensional subspace, called the eigenspace, in which the object is represented as a manifold. Given an unknown input image, the recognition system projects the image to eigenspace. The object is recognized based on the manifold it lies on. The exact position of the projection on the manifold determines the object's pose in the image.A variety of experiments are conducted using objects with complex appearance characteristics. The performance of the recognition and pose estimation algorithms is studied using over a thousand input images of sample objects. Sensitivity of recognition to the number of eigenspace dimensions and the number of learning samples is analyzed. For the objects used, appearance representation in eigenspaces with less than 20 dimensions produces accurate recognition results with an average pose estimation error of about 1.0 degree. A near real-time recognition system with 20 complex objects in the database has been developed. The paper is concluded with a discussion on various issues related to the proposed learning and recognition methodology."

It is shown how such a representation can function as the substrate for \u201cpoint processors\u201d computing geometrical features such as edge curvature. We obtain a clear dichotomy between local and multilocal visual routines. The terms of the truncated Taylor series representing the jets are partial derivatives whose corresponding RF profiles closely mimic the well known units in the primary visual cortex. Hence this description provides a novel means to understand and classify these units.Taking the receptive field outputs as the basic input data one may devise visual routines that compute geometric features on the basis of standard differential geometry exploiting the equivalence with the local jets (partial derivatives with respect to the space coordinates)."

It is shown how several intuitive notions in the context of geometric hashing can be translated into a well-founded Bayesian approach to object recognition. This interpretation leads to well-justified formulas and gives a precise weighted-voting method for the evidence-gathering phase of geometric hashing. A computational model for performing object recognition in a distributed fashion is described. The validity of the authors' paradigm is demonstrated by presenting a prototype system that has been implemented on a small cluster of nondedicated workstations. The resulting system is scalable and can recognize models subjected to 2-D rotation, translation and scale changes in real-world digital imagery. The performance of the system is superior by a factor of 2 to that obtained for a similar system on the Connection Machine-2 (CM-2).<<ETX>>"

This paradigm enables a unified approach to rigid object recognition under different viewing transformation assumptions both for 2-D and 3-D objects obtained by different sensors, e.g. vision, range, tactile. It is based on an intensive off-line model preprocessing (learning) stage, where model information is indexed into a hash-table using minimal, transformation invariant features. This enables the on-line recognition algorithm to be particularly efficient. The algorithm is straightforwardly parallelizable. Initial experimentation of the technique has led to successful recognition of both 2-D and 3-D objects in cluttered scenes from an arbitrary viewpoint. We, also, compare the Geometric Hashing with the Hough Transform and the alignment techniques. Extensions of the basic paradigm which reduce its worst case recognition complexity are discussed."

To achieve this aim, new kinds of vision algorithms need to be developed which run in real time and subserve the robot's goals. Two fundamental goals are determining the location of a known object. Color can be successfully used for both tasks.This article demonstrates that color histograms of multicolored objects provide a robust, efficient cue for indexing into a large database of models. It shows that color histograms are stable object representations in the presence of occlusion and over change in view, and that they can differentiate among a large number of objects. For solving the identification problem, it introduces a technique calledHistogram Intersection, which matches model and image histograms and a fast incremental version of Histogram Intersection, which allows real-time indexing into a large database of stored models. For solving the location problem it introduces an algorithm calledHistogram Backprojection, which performs this task efficiently in crowded scenes."

Although effective in recognizing an isolated object, as was shown by Murase and Nayar (1995), the current method can not be applied to piratically occluded objects that are typical in bin-picking tasks. The analysis also requires that the object is centered in an image before recognition. These limitations of the eigen-space analysis are due to the fact that the whole appearance of an object is utilized as a template for the analysis. We propose a new method, referred to as the \"eigen-window\" method, that stores multiple partial appearances of an object in the eigen-space. Such partial appearances require a large number of memory space. To reduce the memory requirement by avoiding redundant windows and to select only effective windows to be stored, a similarity measure among windows is developed. Using a pose clustering method among windows, the method determines the pose of an object and the object type of itself. We have implemented the method and verify the validity of the method."

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture."

A photometric property is derived, that is invariant to the changes of illumination and to relative object motion with respect to the camera and/or the lighting source in 3D space. We argue that conventional color constancy algorithms can not be used in the recognition of 3D objects. Further we show recognition does not require a full constancy of colors, rather, it only needs something that remains unchanged under the varying light conditions and poses of the objects. Combining the derived color invariant and the spatial constraints on the object surfaces, we identify corresponding positions in the model and the data space coordinates, using centroid invariance of corresponding groups of feature positions. Tests are given to show the stability and efficiency of our approach to 3D object recognition.<<ETX>>"

In this paper we present a new image representation which provides a transformation from the raw pixel data to a small set of image regions which are coherent in color and texture space. This so-called \"blobworld\" representation is based on segmentation using the expectation-maximization algorithm on combined color and texture features. The texture features we use for the segmentation arise from a new approach to texture description and scale selection. We describe a system that uses the blobworld representation to retrieve images. An important and unique aspect of the system is that, in the context of similarity-based querying, the user is allowed to view the internal representation of the submitted image and the query results. Similar systems do not offer the user this view into the workings of the system; consequently, the outcome of many queries on these systems can be quite inexplicable, despite the availability of knobs for adjusting the similarity metric."

The most unique phenotypic feature visible in a person's face is the detailed texture of each eye's iris. The visible texture of a person's iris in a real-time video image is encoded into a compact sequence of multi-scale quadrature 2-D Gabor wavelet coefficients, whose most-significant bits comprise a 256-byte \"iris code\". Statistical decision theory generates identification decisions from Exclusive-OR comparisons of complete iris codes at the rate of 4000 per second, including calculation of decision confidence levels. The distributions observed empirically in such comparisons imply a theoretical \"cross-over\" error rate of one in 131000 when a decision criterion is adopted that would equalize the false accept and false reject error rates. In the typical recognition case, given the mean observed degree of iris code agreement, the decision confidence levels correspond formally to a conditional false accept probability of one in about 10/sup 31/. >"

Color indexing fails, however, when the incident illumination varies either spatially or spectrally. Although this limitation might be overcome by preprocessing with a color constancy algorithm, we instead propose histogramming color ratios. Since the ratios of color RGB triples from neighboring locations are relatively insensitive to changes in the incident illumination, this circumvents the need for color constancy preprocessing. Results of tests with the new color-constant-color-indexing algorithm on synthetic and real images show that it works very well even when the illumination varies spatially in its intensity and color. >"

The authors show how to design and steer the filters and present examples of their use in the analysis of orientation and phase, angularly adaptive filtering, edge detection, and shape from shading. One can also build a self-similar steerable pyramid representation. The same concepts can be generalized to the design of 3-D steerable filters. >"

These two properties make interest points very successful in the contest of image matching. To measure these two properties quantitatively, we introduce two evaluation criteria: repeatability rate and information content. The quality of the interest points depends on the detector used. In this paper several detectors are compared according to the criteria specified above. We determine which detector gives the best results and show that it satisfies the criteria well."

                "text": "Model-based visual recognition systems often match groups of image features to groups of model features to form initial hypotheses, which are then verified. In order to accelerate recognition considerably, the model groups can be arranged in an index space (hashed) offline such that feasible matches are found by indexing into this space. For the case of 2D images and 3D models consisting of point features, bounds on the space required for indexing and on the speedup that such indexing can achieve are demonstrated. It is proved that, even in the absence of image error, each model must be represented by a 2D surface in the index space. This places an unexpected lower bound on the space required to implement indexing and proves that no quantity is invariant for all projections of a model into the image. Theoretical bounds on the speedup achieved by indexing in the presence of image error are also determined, and an implementation of indexing for measuring this speedup empirically is presented. It is found that indexing can produce only a minimal speedup on its own. However, when accompanied by a grouping operation, indexing can provide significant speedups that grow exponentially with the number of features in the groups. >"

Properties of this model are reviewed, and its power demonstrated by application to image restoration and compression. Also described is a vector quantization (VQ) scheme which employs the model in entropy coding a Z/sup N/-lattice.

The robot is equipped with a heterogeneous sampled imaging system, a fovea, resembling the varying resolution in a human retina. The relation between the fovea and multiresolution image processing is discussed together with implications for image operations.A stereo algorithm based on local phase differences is presented both as a stand alone algorithm and as apart of a vergence control system for the robot above. The algorithm is fast and can handle !arge disparities and still give subpixel accuracy. The algorithm uses a wavelet approach beginning at a coarse resolution and refining the disparity estimates while increasing the resolution. The method produces robust and accurate estimates of displacement on synthetic as well as real life stereo images. Disparity filter design is discussed anda number of filters are tested e.g. Gabor filters and lognorm quadrature filters. A special disparity filter designed to have only one phase cycle is also presented.A theory for sequentially defined, data modified focus of attention, based on nested regions of interest is presented. The theory is applied to preattentive gaze control system consisting of three control levels: camera vergence, edge tracking and object finding. The object finder uses circular symmetries as indications on possible object and directs the fixation point accordingly. The edge tracker make the fixation point follow the structures in the scene and the camera vergence control assures that both eyes are fixating the same point. The coordination between the levels is handled with potential fields in the robot parameter space."

Using Canny's design [1], we show that a solution to his precise formulation of detection and localization for an infinite extent filter leads to an optimal operator in one dimension, which can be efficiently implemented by two recursive filters moving in opposite directions. In addition to the noise truncature immunity which results, the recursive nature of the filtering operations leads, with sequential machines, to a substantial saving in computational effort (five multiplications and five additions for one pixel, independent of the size of the neighborhood). The extension to the two-dimensional case is considered and the resulting filtering structures are implemented as two-dimensional recursive filters. Hence, the filter size can be varied by simply changing the value of one parameter without affecting the time execution of the algorithm. Performance measures of this new edge detector are given and compared to Canny's filters. Various experimental results are shown."

Because the underlying mathematics are based on exact data, in practice various heuristics are used to adapt the methods to real data where there is positional uncertainty. This paper provides a precise analysis of affine point matching under uncertainty. We obtain an expression for the range of affine-invariant values that are consistent with a given set of four points, where each image point lies in an \u2208-disc of uncertainty. This range is shown to depend on the actualx-y-positions of the data points. In other words, given uncertainty in the data there are no representations that are invariant with respect to the Cartesian coordinate system of the data. This is problematic for methods, such as geometric hashing, that are based on affine-invariant representations. We also analyze the effect that uncertainty has on the probability that recognition methods using affine transformations will find false positive matches. We find that there is a significant probability of false positives with even moderate levels of sensor error, suggesting the importance of good verification techniques and good grouping techniques."

Modulatory effects in neural responses have also been recently reported in a task where a monkey freely views a natural scene. In this article, we describe a hierarchical network model of visual recognition that explains these experimental observations by using a form of the extended Kalman filter as given by the minimum description length (MDL) principle. The model dynamically combines input-driven bottom-up signals with expectation-driven top-down signals to predict current recognition state. Synaptic weights in the model are adapted in a Hebbian manner according to a learning rule also derived from the MDL principle. The resulting prediction-learning scheme can be viewed as implementing a form of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The architecture of the model posits an active computational role for the reciprocal connections between adjoining visual cortical areas in determining neural response properties. In particular, the model demonstrates the possible role of feedback from higher cortical areas in mediating neurophysiological effects due to stimuli from beyond the classical receptive field. Simulations of the model are provided that help explain the experimental observations regarding neural responses in both free viewing and fixating conditions."

It is established that general-case view-invariants do not exist for any number of points, given true perspective, weak perspective, or orthographic projection models. Feature variation under the weak perspective approximation is then addressed. Though there are no general-case weak-perspective invariants, there are special-case invariants of practical importance. Those cited in the literature are derived from linear dependence relations and the invariance of this type of relation to linear transformation. The variation with respect to view is studied for an important set of 2D line segment features: the relative orientation, size, and position of one line segment with respect to another. The analysis includes an evaluation criterion for feature utility in terms of view-variation. This relationship is a function of both the feature and the particular configuration of 3D line segments. The use of this information in objection recognition is demonstrated for difficult discrimination tasks. >"

This is an important issue since so many computational models have recently appeared that use visual search data as mot ivat ion. How can these results be properly used if the computational nature of the experiment itself is not understood? A computational def ini t ion of the visual search task is presented, and the bottom-up case is distinguished f rom the task-directed case. Then, a proof is given showing that the bottom-up case is NP-Complete in the size of the image, while the task-directed case has linear t ime complexity in the number of items in the display. The NP-Completeness of the bottom-up case is due solely to the inabil i ty to predict which pixels of a test image correspond to objects in a non-exponential manner. This provides the strongest possible evidence for the abandonment of purely bottom-up schemes that address the ful l generality of v is ion. It is thus necessary to sacrifice generality in order to re-shape the vision problem and to opt imize the resources dedicated to visual information processing so that a tractable problem is addressed."

If the two illuminants are the same colour but are placed at different positions then corresponding rgb pixels are related by simple scale factors. In contrast if the lighting geometry is held fixed but the colour of the light changes then it is the individual colour channels (e.g. all the red pixel values or all the green pixels) that are a scaling apart. It is well known that the image dependencies due to lighting geometry and illuminant colour can be respectively removed by normalizing the magnitude of the rgb pixel triplets (e.g. by calculating chromaticities) and by normalizing the lengths of each colour channel (by running the \u2018grey-world\u2019 colour constancy algorithm). However, neither normalization suffices to account for changes in both the lighting geometry and illuminant colour."
