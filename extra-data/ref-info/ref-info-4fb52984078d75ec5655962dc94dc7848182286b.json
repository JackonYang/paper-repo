The system is an application of the dynamic link architecture, which owes its strength to an enhancement of tradition neural networks by a new kind of variable to express the hierarchical grouping of neurons. This capability is used to group primitive local feature detectors (Gabor-based wavelets) into composite feature detectors (jets) and to preserve neighborhood relationships between jets when they lose position information on the way from the image domain to the object domain. Due to the potential for grouping, objects can be represented as attributed graphs, with jets serving as attributes. Recognition is formulated as graph matching and is implemented as a topologically constrained diffusion of image-object links. A hierarchical sequence of matches, from low-frequency components of jets to high-frequency components, is used. Size invariance is achieved by interposing diffusion steps in magnification space. The system is implemented on a network of transputers"

Gray-level images are represented by a resolution hierarchy of local Gabor components, which are all scaled and rotated versions of each other. The components centered on one image point form a Gabor jet. A single jet provides a distortion-insensitive local representation of part of an image. Object recognition is achieved by matching image point jets to jets in stored prototype patterns. For a selected image jet the best matches are determined, under a constraint preserving spatial arrangement. The procedure amounts to labeled graph matching, with Gabor jets forming labels to nodes and topology determining links. A contrast-insensitive similarity measure provides for invariance with respect to lighting conditions. The authors have formulated the matching procedure as an optimization task solved by diffusion of match points. This diffusion is controlled by a potential determined by jet similarity and the topology-preserving constraint. The algorithm implements a neural network architecture.<<ETX>>"

To understand the representation of images by the mammalian visual system, it might therefore be useful to consider the statistics of images from the natural environment (i.e., images with trees, rocks, bushes, etc). In this study, various coding schemes are compared in relation to how they represent the information in such natural images. The coefficients of such codes are represented by arrays of mechanisms that respond to local regions of space, spatial frequency, and orientation (Gabor-like transforms). For many classes of image, such codes will not be an efficient means of representing information. However, the results obtained with six natural images suggest that the orientation and the spatial-frequency tuning of mammalian simple cells are well suited for coding the information in such images if the goal of the code is to convert higher-order redundancy (e.g., correlation between the intensities of neighboring pixels) into first-order redundancy (i.e., the response distribution of the coefficients). Such coding produces a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio and permits information to be transmitted with only a subset of the total number of cells. These results support Barlow's theory that the goal of natural vision is to represent the information in the natural environment with minimal redundancy."

Using the two-dimensional (2D) spatial and spectral response profiles described in the previous two reports, we test Daugman's generalization of Marcelja's hypothesis that simple receptive fields belong to a class of linear spatial filters analogous to those described by Gabor and referred to here as 2D Gabor filters. 2. In the space domain, we found 2D Gabor filters that fit the 2D spatial response profile of each simple cell in the least-squared error sense (with a simplex algorithm), and we show that the residual error is devoid of spatial structure and statistically indistinguishable from random error. 3. Although a rigorous statistical approach was not possible with our spectral data, we also found a Gabor function that fit the 2D spectral response profile of each simple cell and observed that the residual errors are everywhere small and unstructured. 4. As an assay of spatial linearity in two dimensions, on which the applicability of Gabor theory is dependent, we compare the filter parameters estimated from the independent 2D spatial and spectral measurements described above. Estimates of most parameters from the two domains are highly correlated, indicating that assumptions about spatial linearity are valid. 5. Finally, we show that the functional form of the 2D Gabor filter provides a concise mathematical expression, which incorporates the important spatial characteristics of simple receptive fields demonstrated in the previous two reports. Prominent here are 1) Cartesian separable spatial response profiles, 2) spatial receptive fields with staggered subregion placement, 3) Cartesian separable spectral response profiles, 4) spectral response profiles with axes of symmetry not including the origin, and 5) the uniform distribution of spatial phase angles. 6. We conclude that the Gabor function provides a useful and reasonably accurate description of most spatial aspects of simple receptive fields. Thus it seems that an optimal strategy has evolved for sampling images simultaneously in the 2D spatial and spatial frequency domains."

Recently it has been shown that their algorithm is related to neural networks of Hopfield and Tank, and that they both can be understood as the semiclassical approximation to statistical mechanics of related physical models. The main point of the elastic net algorithm is seen to be in the way one deals with the constraints when evaluating the effective cost function (free energy in the thermodynamic analogy), and not in its geometric foundation emphasized originally by Durbin and Willshaw. As a consequence, the elastic net algorithm is a special case of the more general physically based computations and can be generalized to a large class of nongeometric problems. In this paper we further elaborate on this observation, and generalize the elastic net to the quadratic assignment problem. We work out in detail its special case, the graph matching problem, because it is an important problem with many applications in computational vision and neural modeling. Simulation results on random graphs, and on structured (hand-designed) graphs of moderate size (20-100 nodes) are discussed."

Theoretical considerations as well as neurophysiological findings point to the importance in such processes of temporal correlations in neuronal activity. In a previous model, we showed that reentrant signaling among rhythmically active neuronal groups can correlate responses along spatially extended contours. We now have modified and extended this model to address the problems of perceptual grouping and figure-ground segregation in vision. A novel feature is that the efficacy of the connections is allowed to change on a fast time scale. This results in active reentrant connections that amplify the correlations among neuronal groups. The responses of the model are able to link the elements corresponding to a coherent figure and to segregate them from the background or from another figure in a way that is consistent with the so-called Gestalt laws."

Diffculties of this \"conventional theory\" are traced back to a specific deficiency: there is no way to express relations between active cells (as for instance their representing parts of the same object). A new theory is proposed to cure this deficiency. It introduces a new kind of dynamical control, termed synaptic modulation, according to which synapses switch between a conducting and a non- conducting state. The dynamics of this variable is controlled on a fast time scale by correlations in the temporal fine structure of cellular signals. Furthermore, conventional synaptic plasticity is replaced by a refined version. Synaptic modulation and plasticity form the basis for short-term and long-term memory, respectively. Signal correlations, shaped by the variable network, express structure and relationships within objects. In particular, the figure-ground problem may be solved in this way. Synaptic modulation introduces flexibility into cerebral networks which is necessary to solve the invariance problem. Since momentarily useless connections are deactivated, interference between different memory traces can be reduced, and memory capacity increased, in comparison with conventional associative memory."

Correlations are created naturally by the usual associative connections. In our simulations, temporal patterns take the form of oscillatory bursts of activity.

The case of the ordered retinotectal projection in amphibia and fishes is discussed in great detail. It is suggested that retinotectal mappings are the result of two mechanisms acting in concert. One mechanism induces a set of retinal markers into the tectum. By this means, an initially haphazard pattern of synapses is transformed into a continuous or piece-wise continuous projection. The other mechanism places the individual pieces of the map in the correct orientation. The machinery necessary for this inductive scheme has been expressed in terms of a set of differential equations, which have been solved numerically for a number of cases. Straightforward assumptions are made as to how markers are distributed in the retina; how they are induced into the tectum; and how the induced markers bring about alterations in the pattern of synaptic contacts. A detailed physiological interpretation of the model is given. The inductive mechanism has been formulated at the level of the individual synaptic interactions. Therefore, it is possible to specify, in a given situation, not only the nature of the end state of the mapping but also how the mapping develops over time. The role of the modes of growth of retina and tectum in shaping the developing projection becomes clear. Since, on this model, the tectum is initially devoid of markers, there is an important difference between the development and the regeneration of ordered mappings. In the development of duplicate maps from various types of compound-eyes, it is suggested that the tectum, rather than the retina, contains an abnormal distribution of markers. An important parameter in these experiments, and also in the regeneration experiments where part-duplication has been found, is the range of interaction amongst the retinal cells. It is suggested that the results of many of the regeneration experiments (including apparently contradictory ones) are manifestations of a conflict between the two alternative ways of specifying the orientation of the map: through the information carried by the markers previously induced into the tectum and through the orientation mechanism itself."

Recently, we have shown that neurons in the cat visual cortex have oscillatory responses in the range 40\u201360 Hz (refs 1,2) which occur in synchrony for cells in a functional column and are tightly correlated with a local oscillatory field potential. This led us to hypothesize that the synchronization of oscillatory responses of spatially distributed, feature selective cells might be a way to establish relations between features in different parts of the visual field2,3. In support of this hypothesis, we demonstrate here that neurons in spatially separate columns can synchronize their oscillatory responses. The synchronization has, on average, no phase difference, depends on the spatial separation and the orientation preference of the cells and is influenced by global stimulus properties."

In the case of one-dimensional elds it is shown that the system is able to select either of the two possible orientations and to produce a precise topological projection.

The corresponding view in computer science identifies artificial intelligence with appropriate programs, executed on the computer. Computer chess, artificial speech production and pattern recognition testify to the success of the approach. In both cases, brain and computer, the process of organization responsible for the genesis of connection pattern or program is considered as an independent issue. It is in the style of cybernetics to assume that the genome of the individual contains a blueprint for the wiring of its nervous system, and that during ontogenesis this information is simply translated from one form into another. Thus, phylogeny can freely program nervous connectivity to its requirements."

Topographically ordered mappings, found widely in nervous systems, are those in which neighbouring elements in one sheet of cells project to neighbouring elements in a second sheet. Exploiting this neighbourhood property leads to a new theory for the establishment of topographical mappings, in which the distance between two cells is expressed in terms of their similarity with respect to certain physical properties assigned to them. This topographical code can be realized in a model employing either synchronization of nervous activity or exchange of specific molecules between neighbouring cells. By means of modifiable synapses the code is used to set up a topographical mapping between two sheets with the same internal structure. We have investigated the neural activity version. Without needing to make any elaborate assumptions about its structure or about the operations its elements are to carry out we have shown that the mappings are set up in a system-to-system rather than a cell-to-cell fashion. The pattern of connections develops in a step-by-step and orderly fashion, the orientation of the mappings being laid down in the earliest stages of development."

Given the positions of N cities, which in the simplest case lie in the plane, what is the shortest closed tour in which each city can be visited once? We describe how a parallel analogue algorithm, derived from a formal model2\u20133 for the establishment of topographically ordered projections in the brain4\u201310, can be applied to the travelling salesman problem1,11,12. Using an iterative procedure, a circular closed path is gradually elongated non-uniformly until it eventually passes sufficiently near to all the cities to define a tour. This produces shorter tour lengths than another recent parallel analogue algorithm13, scales well with the size of the problem, and is naturally extendable to a large class of optimization problems involving topographic mappings between geometrical structures14."

They are to be understood as a basis for self-organization. Natural assumptions on cooperation and competition lead to a conjecture regarding the type of dynamically preferred connectivity patterns.

Applications to sensory segmentation, to invariant pattern recognition, and to resonant projection between homeomorphic structures are discussed."

Here we show how to extend this algorithm to isomorphism testing for graphs of small genus. This result is noteworthy for at least two reasons. First, this extends the polynomial time isomorphism results for the plane [HT 72] and also the projective plane [L 80] to arbitrary surfaces. Second, this gives one of the few known natural decompositions of the isomorphism problem into an infinite hierarchy of problems P<subscrpt>o</subscrpt>,P<subscrpt>1</subscrpt>,... such that isomorphism testing of problems in P<subscrpt>1</subscrpt> is decidable in time v<supscrpt>O(i)</supscrpt>."

In this paper we investigate the problem of optimal compression of propositional Horn production rule knowledge bases. The standard approach to this problem, consisting in the removal of redundant rules from a knowledge base, leads to an \"irredundant\" but not necessarily optimal knowledge base. We prove here that the number of rules in any irredundant Horn knowledge base involving n propositional variables is at most n 0 1 times the minimum possible number of rules. In order to formalize the optimal compression problem, we define a Boolean function of a knowledge base as being the function whose set of true points is the set of models of the knowledge base. In this way the optimal compression of production rule knowledge bases becomes a problem of Boolean function minimization. In this paper we prove that the minimization of Horn functions (i.e. Boolean functions associated to Horn knowledge bases) is..."
