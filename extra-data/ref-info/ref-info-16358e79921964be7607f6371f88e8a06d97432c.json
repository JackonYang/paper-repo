The problem is significantly more challenging than reading text in scanned documents, and has only recently gained attention from the computer vision community. Sub-components of the problem, such as text detection and cropped image word recognition, have been studied in isolation [7, 4, 20]. However, what is unclear is how these recent approaches contribute to solving the end-to-end problem of word recognition. We fill this gap by constructing and evaluating two systems. The first, representing the de facto state-of-the-art, is a two stage pipeline consisting of text detection followed by a leading OCR engine. The second is a system rooted in generic object recognition, an extension of our previous work in [20]. We show that the latter approach achieves superior performance. While scene text recognition has generally been treated with highly domain-specific methods, our results demonstrate the suitability of applying generic computer vision methods. Adopting this approach opens the door for real world scene text recognition to benefit from the rapid advances that have been taking place in object recognition."

Contrary to recognition of printed documents, recognizing scene text is a challenging problem. We focus on the problem of recognizing text extracted from natural scene images and the web. Significant attempts have been made to address this problem in the recent past. However, many of these works benefit from the availability of strong context, which naturally limits their applicability. In this work we present a framework that uses a higher order prior computed from an English dictionary to recognize a word, which may or may not be a part of the dictionary. We show experimental results on publicly available datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a large challenging word dataset with five thousand words to evaluate various steps of our method exhaustively. The main contributions of this work are: (1) We present a framework, which incorporates higher order statistical language models to recognize words in an unconstrained manner (i.e. we overcome the need for restricted word lists, and instead use an English dictionary to compute the priors). (2) We achieve significant improvement (more than 20%) in word recognition accuracies without using a restricted word list. (3) We introduce a large word recognition dataset (atleast 5 times larger than other public datasets) with character level annotation and benchmark it."

Our approach combines local likelihood and pairwise positional consistency priors with higher order priors that enforce consistency of characters (lexicon) and their attributes (font and colour). Unlike traditional stage-based methods, word recognition in our framework is performed by estimating the maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution under the joint posterior distribution of the model. MAP inference in our model is performed through the use of weighted finite-state transducers (WFSTs). We show how the efficiency of certain operations on WFSTs can be utilized to find the most likely word under the model in an efficient manner. We evaluate our method on a range of challenging datasets (ICDAR'03, SVT, ICDAR'11). Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for cropped word recognition."

Recognizing such text is a challenging problem, even more so than the recognition of scanned documents. In this work, we focus on the problem of recognizing text extracted from street images. We present a framework that exploits both bottom-up and top-down cues. The bottom-up cues are derived from individual character detections from the image. We build a Conditional Random Field model on these detections to jointly model the strength of the detections and the interactions between them. We impose top-down cues obtained from a lexicon-based prior, i.e. language statistics, on the model. The optimal word represented by the text image is obtained by minimizing the energy function corresponding to the random field model. We show significant improvements in accuracies on two challenging public datasets, namely Street View Text (over 15%) and ICDAR 2003 (nearly 10%)."

At one end of the spectrum, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) applied to scanned pages of well formatted printed text is one of the most successful applications of computer vision to date. At the other extreme lie visual CAPTCHAs - text that is constructed explicitly to fool computer vision algorithms. Both tasks involve recognizing text, yet one is nearly solved while the other remains extremely challenging. In this work, we argue that the appearance of words in the wild spans this range of difficulties and propose a new word recognition approach based on state-of-the-art methods from generic object recognition, in which we consider object categories to be the words themselves. We compare performance of leading OCR engines - one open source and one proprietary - with our new approach on the ICDAR Robust Reading data set and a new word spotting data set we introduce in this paper: the Street View Text data set. We show improvements of up to 16% on the data sets, demonstrating the feasibility of a new approach to a seemingly old problem."

The real-time performance is achieved by posing the character detection problem as an efficient sequential selection from the set of Extremal Regions (ERs). The ER detector is robust to blur, illumination, color and texture variation and handles low-contrast text. In the first classification stage, the probability of each ER being a character is estimated using novel features calculated with O(1) complexity per region tested. Only ERs with locally maximal probability are selected for the second stage, where the classification is improved using more computationally expensive features. A highly efficient exhaustive search with feedback loops is then applied to group ERs into words and to select the most probable character segmentation. Finally, text is recognized in an OCR stage trained using synthetic fonts. The method was evaluated on two public datasets. On the ICDAR 2011 dataset, the method achieves state-of-the-art text localization results amongst published methods and it is the first one to report results for end-to-end text recognition. On the more challenging Street View Text dataset, the method achieves state-of-the-art recall. The robustness of the proposed method against noise and low contrast of characters is demonstrated by \u201cfalse positives\u201d caused by detected watermark text in the dataset."

Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is popularly used to estimate the similarity between word images. Word images are represented as sequences of feature vectors, and the cost associated with dynamic programming based alignment is considered as the dissimilarity between them. However, such approaches are computationally costly when compared to fixed length matching schemes. In this paper, we explore systematic methods for identifying appropriate distance metrics for a given database or language. This is achieved by learning query specific distance functions which can be computed online efficiently. We show that a weighted Euclidean distance can outperform DTW for matching word images. This class of distance functions are also ideal for scalability and large scale matching. Our results are validated with mean Average Precision (mAP) on a fully annotated data set of 160K word images. We then show that the learnt distance functions can even be extended to a new database to obtain accurate retrieval."

Convenient access to a collection requires an index, which is manually created at great labor and expense. Since current handwriting recognizers do not perform well on historical documents, a technique called word spotting has been developed: clusters with occurrences of the same word in a collection are established using image matching. By annotating \"interesting\" clusters, an index can be built automatically. We present an algorithm for matching handwritten words in noisy historical documents. The segmented word images are preprocessed to create sets of 1-dimensional features, which are then compared using dynamic time warping. We present experimental results on two different data sets from the George Washington collection. Our experiments show that this algorithm performs better and is faster than competing matching techniques."

In this article, we propose to use as an alternative the Fisher kernel framework. We first show why the Fisher representation is well-suited to the retrieval problem: it describes an image by what makes it different from other images. One drawback of the Fisher vector is that it is high-dimensional and, as opposed to the BOV, it is dense. The resulting memory and computational costs do not make Fisher vectors directly amenable to large-scale retrieval. Therefore, we compress Fisher vectors to reduce their memory footprint and speed-up the retrieval. We compare three binarization approaches: a simple approach devised for this representation and two standard compression techniques. We show on two publicly available datasets that compressed Fisher vectors perform very well using as little as a few hundreds of bits per image, and significantly better than a very recent compressed BOV approach."

Like Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), our models take account of correlations between words (synonymy, polysemy). However, unlike LSI our models are trained with a supervised signal directly on the ranking task of interest, which we argue is the reason for our superior results. As the query and target texts are modeled separately, our approach is easily generalized to different retrieval tasks, such as online advertising placement. Dealing with models on all pairs of words features is computationally challenging. We propose several improvements to our basic model for addressing this issue, including low rank (but diagonal preserving) representations, and correlated feature hashing (CFH). We provide an empirical study of all these methods on retrieval tasks based on Wikipedia documents as well as an Internet advertisement task. We obtain state-of-the-art performance while providing realistically scalable methods."

We work in the framework of model-based approaches, where each sequence is first mapped to a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and then a measure of similarity is computed between the HMMs. We propose to model sequences with semicontinuous HMMs (SC-HMMs). This is a particular type of HMM whose emission probabilities in each state are mixtures of shared Gaussians. This crucial constraint provides two major benefits. First, the a priori information contained in the common set of Gaussians leads to a more accurate estimate of the HMM parameters. Second, the computation of a similarity between two SC-HMMs can be simplified to a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) between their mixture weight vectors, which significantly reduces the computational cost. Experiments are carried out on a handwritten word retrieval task in three different datasets-an in-house dataset of real handwritten letters, the George Washington dataset, and the IFN/ENIT dataset of Arabic handwritten words. These experiments show that the proposed similarity outperforms the traditional DTW between the original sequences, and the model-based approach which uses ordinary continuous HMMs. We also show that this increase in accuracy can be traded against a significant reduction of the computational cost."

We then jointly optimize dimensionality reduction and indexing in order to obtain a precise vector comparison as well as a compact representation. The evaluation shows that the image representation can be reduced to a few dozen bytes while preserving high accuracy. Searching a 100 million image data set takes about 250 ms on one processor core."

In the context of image classification the FK was shown to extend the popular bag-of-visual-words (BOV) by going beyond count statistics. However, in practice, this enriched representation has not yet shown its superiority over the BOV. In the first part we show that with several well-motivated modifications over the original framework we can boost the accuracy of the FK. On PASCAL VOC 2007 we increase the Average Precision (AP) from 47.9% to 58.3%. Similarly, we demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on CalTech 256. A major advantage is that these results are obtained using only SIFT descriptors and costless linear classifiers. Equipped with this representation, we can now explore image classification on a larger scale. In the second part, as an application, we compare two abundant resources of labeled images to learn classifiers: ImageNet and Flickr groups. In an evaluation involving hundreds of thousands of training images we show that classifiers learned on Flickr groups perform surprisingly well (although they were not intended for this purpose) and that they can complement classifiers learned on more carefully annotated datasets."

As kernel machines are difficult to scale to large training sets, it has been proposed to perform an explicit mapping of the data and to learn directly linear classifiers in the new space. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning image categorizers on large image sets (e.g. > 100k images) using bag-of-visual-words (BOV) image representations and Support Vector Machine classifiers. We experiment with three approaches to BOV embedding: 1) kernel PCA (kPCA) [15], 2) a modified kPCA we propose for additive kernels and 3) random projections for shift-invariant kernels [14]. We report experiments on 3 datasets: Cal-tech101, VOC07 and ImageNet. An important conclusion is that simply square-rooting BOV vectors \u2013 which corresponds to an exact mapping for the Bhattacharyya kernel \u2013 already leads to large improvements, often quite close to the best results obtained with additive kernels. Another conclusion is that, although it is possible to go beyond additive kernels, the embedding comes at a much higher cost."

Our goal is to devise classifiers which can incorporate such images and classes on-the-fly at (near) zero cost. We cast this problem into one of learning a metric which is shared across all classes and explore k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) and nearest class mean (NCM) classifiers. We learn metrics on the ImageNet 2010 challenge data set, which contains more than 1.2M training images of 1K classes. Surprisingly, the NCM classifier compares favorably to the more flexible k-NN classifier, and has comparable performance to linear SVMs. We also study the generalization performance, among others by using the learned metric on the ImageNet-10K dataset, and we obtain competitive performance. Finally, we explore zero-shot classification, and show how the zero-shot model can be combined very effectively with small training datasets."

A subsequence is any ordered sequence of k characters occurring in the text though not necessarily contiguously. The subsequences are weighted by an exponentially decaying factor of their full length in the text, hence emphasising those occurrences which are close to contiguous. A direct computation of this feature vector would involve a prohibitive amount of computation even for modest values of k, since the dimension of the feature space grows exponentially with k. The paper describes how despite this fact the inner product can be efficiently evaluated by a dynamic programming technique. A preliminary experimental comparison of the performance of the kernel compared with a standard word feature space kernel [6] is made showing encouraging results."

Examples include locality-constrained linear encoding [23], improved Fisher encoding [17], super vector encoding [27], and kernel codebook encoding [20]. While several authors have reported very good results on the challenging PASCAL VOC classification data by means of these new techniques, differences in the feature computation and learning algorithms, missing details in the description of the methods, and different tuning of the various components, make it impossible to compare directly these methods and hard to reproduce the results reported. This paper addresses these shortcomings by carrying out a rigorous evaluation of these new techniques by: (1) fixing the other elements of the pipeline (features, learning, tuning); (2) disclosing all the implementation details, and (3) identifying both those aspects of each method which are particularly important to achieve good performance, and those aspects which are less critical. This allows a consistent comparative analysis of these encoding methods. Several conclusions drawn from our analysis cannot be inferred from the original publications."

This bag of keypoints method is based on vector quantization of affine invariant descriptors of image patches. We propose and compare two alternative implementations using different classifiers: Naive Bayes and SVM. The main advantages of the method are that it is simple, computationally efficient and intrinsically invariant. We present results for simultaneously classifying seven semantic visual categories. These results clearly demonstrate that the method is robust to background clutter and produces good categorization accuracy even without exploiting geometric information."

We propose a strongly performing method that scales to such datasets by simultaneously learning to optimize precision at k of the ranked list of annotations for a given image and learning a low-dimensional joint embedding space for both images and annotations. Our method both outperforms several baseline methods and, in comparison to them, is faster and consumes less memory. We also demonstrate how our method learns an interpretable model, where annotations with alternate spellings or even languages are close in the embedding space. Hence, even when our model does not predict the exact annotation given by a human labeler, it often predicts similar annotations, a fact that we try to quantify by measuring the newly introduced \u201csibling\u201d precision metric, where our method also obtains excellent results."

We move away from traditional ALPR techniques and advocate for a data-driven approach for vehicle identification. Here, given a plate image region, the idea is to search for a near-duplicate image in an annotated database; if found, the identity of the near-duplicate is transferred to the input region. Although this approach could be perceived as impractical, we actually demonstrate that it is feasible with state-of-the-art image representations, and that it presents some advantages in terms of speed, and time-to-deploy. To overcome the issue of identifying previously unseen identities, we propose an image simulation approach where photo-realistic images of license plates are generated for desired plate numbers. We demonstrate that there is no perceivable performance difference between using synthetic and real plates. We also improve the matching accuracy using similarity learning, which is in the spirit of domain adaptation."

Intuitively, a good information retrieval system should present relevant documents high in the ranking, with less relevant documents following below. While previous approaches to learning retrieval functions from examples exist, they typically require training data generated from relevance judgments by experts. This makes them difficult and expensive to apply. The goal of this paper is to develop a method that utilizes clickthrough data for training, namely the query-log of the search engine in connection with the log of links the users clicked on in the presented ranking. Such clickthrough data is available in abundance and can be recorded at very low cost. Taking a Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, this paper presents a method for learning retrieval functions. From a theoretical perspective, this method is shown to be well-founded in a risk minimization framework. Furthermore, it is shown to be feasible even for large sets of queries and features. The theoretical results are verified in a controlled experiment. It shows that the method can effectively adapt the retrieval function of a meta-search engine to a particular group of users, outperforming Google in terms of retrieval quality after only a couple of hundred training examples."

These models possess a rich internal structure reflecting task-specific relations and constraints. This monograph introduces the reader to the most popular classes of structured models in computer vision. Our focus is discrete undirected graphical models which we cover in detail together with a description of algorithms for both probabilistic inference and maximum a posteriori inference. We discuss separately recently successful techniques for prediction in general structured models. In the second part of this monograph we describe methods for parameter learning where we distinguish the classic maximum likelihood based methods from the more recent prediction-based parameter learning methods. We highlight developments to enhance current models and discuss kernelized models and latent variable models. To make the monograph more practical and to provide links to further study we provide examples of successful application of many methods in the computer vision literature."

The main contributions of this work lie in the presentation of a general formalization of zero-data learning, in an experimental analysis of its properties and in empirical evidence showing that generalization is possible and significant in this context. The experimental work of this paper addresses two classification problems of character recognition and a multitask ranking problem in the context of drug discovery. Finally, we conclude by discussing how this new framework could lead to a novel perspective on how to extend machine learning towards AI, where an agent can be given a specification for a learning problem before attempting to solve it (with very few or even zero examples)."

We show that an approximation to the eigendecomposition of the Gram matrix can be computed by the Nystrom method (which is used for the numerical solution of eigenproblems). This is achieved by carrying out an eigendecomposition on a smaller system of size m < n, and then expanding the results back up to n dimensions. The computational complexity of a predictor using this approximation is O(m2n). We report experiments on the USPS and abalone data sets and show that we can set m \u226a n without any significant decrease in the accuracy of the solution."
