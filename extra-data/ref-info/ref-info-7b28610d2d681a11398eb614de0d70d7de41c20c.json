The technique applies to any method of calculating the predictor weights. In this study three prediction methods were compared by cross-validation--multiple regression on the predictors, on the principal components of the predictors, and on the principal predictors. Prediction from the principal predictors is only possible when there are several criterion variables. In order to discover the parameters of the multivariate distribution which affect the choice of prediction method and the number of principal components or principal predictors to include in the regression, a large number of distributions were simulated on a computer and samples generated from these distributions. The population distributions varied in the following parameters: n, the number of predictors, m, the number of criteria, rho sq, the squared multiple correlation in the case of one criterion or the average squared multiple correlation of m criteria when m > 1; and pi sq, the average predictor variance related to the criteria. A typical calculation consisted of the following steps: generation of a population distribution for a set of values of the parameters; generation of two samples of size N from this population; calculation, in one sample, of the predictor weights for one or more prediction methods; and validation of these weights in the second sample. A large number of populations were generated, varying in the values of the parameters."

PLACKETT in the Chair] SUMMARY This paper is concerned with the analysis of data from a multiple regression of a single variable, y, on a set of independent variables, xl, x2, .. . ,xr. It is argued that the form of the analysis should depend on the use that is to be made of the regression, and that therefore an approach employing ideas from decision theory may be worth while. Two situations are analysed in this way: in the first it is desired to predict a future value of y; in the second we wish to control y at a preassigned value. The two analyses are found to be different: in particular, the standard errors of the regression coefficients are found to be irrelevant in the prediction problem, but not in the control problem. In the former it is shown that, under rather special assumptions on the multiple regression experiment, the analysis is similar to that recommended by other writers. If the costs of control do not depend on the values at which the control takes place, a similar analysis holds for the second problem. The approach throughout is Bayesian: there is no discussion of this point, I merely ask the non-Bayesian reader to examine the results and consider whether they provide sensible and practical answers."

If there are k independent variables, there are 2 k possible linear equations to be examined; one equation using none of the variables, k using one variable, k(k \u2013 1)/2 using two variables, etc. Often there are several equally good candidates. Selection depends on whether one needs a simple interpolation formula or estimates of the effects of individual independent variables. Fractional factorial designs for sampling the 2 k possibilities and a new statistic proposed by C. Mallows simplify the search for the best candidate.

These are shown to have full asymptotic efficiency for a prototype family of distributions, used to define the estimators. The asymptotic efficiency under other distributions of interest is also characterized. For sample sizes n = 20, 30, 40, 50, and 100 the efficiencies were estimated by Monte Carlo methods under the following distributions: normal, logistic, double-exponential, and contaminated normal (one percent, five percent, ten percent). Over all these shapes the efficiencies obtained are approximately 88 percent or more for all n; they rise to approximately 91 percent or more for n = 100. Some theoretical and numerical comparisons with other estimators are given."

They show that the average of roughly the middle quarter of the ordered sample has minimum asymptotic variance within this class, and that asymptotically it eliminates about 36 per cent of the efficiency loss of the median (the most commonly used estimator) in comparison to the maximum likelihood estimator (m.l.e.). Of course both the m.l.e. and the best linear unbiased estimator based on the order statistics (BLUE) achieve full asymptotic efficiency in the Cramer-Rao sense and there can be no dispute about the relative merits of the three estimators asymptotically, or about the inferiority of the median (with asymptotic efficiency 8/\u03c02 \u0117 0.8 compared with about 0.88 for the estimator of Rothenberg et al.).

Our primary goal in this book is to sharpen the skill, sophistication, and in- tuition of the reader in the interpretation of mental test data, and in the construction and use of mental tests both as instruments of psychological theory and as tools in the practical problems of selection, evaluation, and guidance. We seek to do this by exposing the reader to some psychologically meaningful statistical theories of mental test scores. Although this book is organized in terms of test-score theories and models, the practical applications and limitations of each model studied receive substantial emphasis, and these discussions are presented in as nontechnical a manner as we have found possible. Since this book catalogues a host of test theory models and formulas, it may serve as a reference handbook. Also, for a limited group of specialists, this book aims to provide a more rigorous foundation for further theoretical research than has heretofore been available.One aim of this book is to present statements of the assumptions, together with derivations of the implications, of a selected group of statistical models that the authors believe to be useful as guides in the practices of test construction and utilization. With few exceptions we have given a complete proof for each major result presented in the book. In many cases these proofs are simpler, more complete, and more illuminating than those originally offered. When we have omitted proofs or parts of proofs, we have generally provided a reference containing the omitted argument. We have left some proofs as exercises for the reader, but only when the general method of proof has already been demonstrated. At times we have proved only special cases of more generally stated theorems, when the general proof affords no additional insight into the problem and yet is substantially more complex mathematically."

An estimator T, which is a weighted mean of T 1, T s, \u2026, Tm , is found that has the same asymptotic distribution as that of Tj , when the sample comes from Dj , j = 1, 2, \u2026, m. Here the weights are functions of the sample items. Empirical evidence is given which indicates that T is satisfactory for small sample sizes. It is proved that if Tj and the weight Wj are odd location and even location-free statistics, respectively, j = 1, 2, \u2026, m, then T = \u03a3WiTi , where \u03a3Wi = 1, is an unbiased estimator of the center of every symmetric distribution, provided certain expectations exist. This is useful in the construction of the weight function Wj."

Back in print for a new generation of readers, this classic volume applies mathematics, including the once-controversial Bayesian analysis, to the heart of a literary and historical problem by studying frequently used words in the texts.

                "text": "At the present time very little can be claimed to be known as to the effects of weather upon farm crops. The obscurity of the subject, in spite of its immense importance to a great national industry, may be ascribed partly to the inherent complexity of the problem which it presents, and more especially to the lack of quantitative data obtained either under experimental or under industrial conditions, by the study of which accurate knowledge alone can be acquired. Of the industrial applications of such knowledge it is unnecessary to speak here in detail. It is sufficient to indicate that the present system of Life Insurance, which safeguards the economic stability of many thousands of families, and occupies the activities of many of the greatest financial corporations, was made possible by the studies of statistics of human mortality by the mathematicians of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and that on the basis of adequate knowledge similar economic stability with its attendant security of capital should be within the reach of the industrial farmer. The inherent complexity of the relationships which it is sought to elucidate, between the yields of farm crops, and the previous weather which largely controls those yields, arises primarily from the complexity of the problem of specifying the weather itself. Meteorologists have, however, gradually devised a number of instrumental observations, which although far from specifying the total environment of the growing plant, as understood by the plant physiologist, do nevertheless give a sufficiently detailed account of the general environmental conditions of the growing crop, in so far as these vary from season to season. It is probable indeed that almost all the weather influences to which crop variations are due could be expressed in terms of the instrumental observations of a modern meteorological station. The actual difficulty of calculating the crop variations from given instrumental records is, however, immense; only an attack of the most preliminary kind upon the general problem can be attempted in this paper. The complete aim of agricultural meteorology should, however, be emphasised, for it is only by its substantial achievement that other causes of crop variation can be freed from much obscurity."

The orbital plane of Sputnik 2 rotated less rapidly than expected, indicating1 that the polar flattening was about 0.35% less (the polar diameter about 150 m greater) than had been thought. The variations in the perigee height of Vanguard 1, as perigee moved successfully north and south of the equator, showed2 that the polar section of the geoid\u2014the profile of the sealevel surface revealed by a cut through the poles\u2014was not symmetrical about the equator but had a slight pear-shape tendency, with the stem at the North Pole. Floating at sealevel at the North Pole, one would be about 40 m further from the equator than an equally undauntable explorer who bored down to sealevel at the South Pole."
