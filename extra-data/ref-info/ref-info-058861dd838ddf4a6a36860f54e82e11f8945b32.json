The essence of our approach is to augment a previous connectivity analysis based algorithm with content analysis. We identify three problems with the existing approach and devise algorithms to tackle them. The results of a user evaluation are reported that show an improvement of precision at 10 documents by at least 45% over pure connectivity analysis."

We contend that these clusters represent the scientific specialties which currently exhibit high levels of activity. This technique, we believe, opens the way to a systematic exploration of the entire specialty structure of science, including both the internal structure of specialties and their relationship to one another. That science is a mosaic of specialties, and not a unified whole, either socially or intellectually, is a frequently made assumption, but only recently has this infra-structure of science become the subject of systematic study. Most scientists have intuitive notions about the subdivisions of their fields, but no observer, however broadly trained, can gain an overall perspective on the scientific mosaic. A series of recent studies has called attention to the importance of specialties as 'building blocks' of science. Crawford's paper' described how one specialty, sleep research, is effectively organized as a communication system around certain key individuals and research centres. Griffith and Mullins2 have argued that major changes in a variety of disciplines have been generated within small, socially coherent groups. *325 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, I 9I o6, USA."

These data present a special analytical problem because the meaning of non-choice among pick-any choice data is always ambiguous: A non-chosen alternative may be either unacceptable, or acceptable but not considered, or acceptable and considered but not chosen. A model and scaling method for these data are introduced, allowing for this ambiguity of non-choice. Subjects are represented as points whose coordinates are proportional to the centroids of the points representing their choices. Alternatives are represented at points whose coordinates are proportional to the centroids of the points representing subjects who have chosen them. This centroid scaling technique estimates multidimensional joint spaces from the pick-any data."

Magnitudes of influence flow generate objective indices of cohesiveness, which serve as the basis for the identification of cliques. This stands in contrast to the factor-analytic rationale of similarity of incoming and outgoing choice patterns. The model departs from the classical sociometric tradition by permitting links to have fractional and/or negative strength, and by taking simultaneous account of direct and indirect linkages. The cohesiveness index is useful for inter-group and diachronic comparisons of structures."

To test the validity of this assumption, 5\u20136 years aggregate cocitation data for 41 authors in macroeconomics and 49 authors in Drosophila genetics (the genetics of fruit flies) were compared with independent judgments of inter\u2010author similarity collected from 14 macroeconomists and 15 geneticists via a card\u2010sorting technique. Non\u2010metric multidimensional scaling (ALSCAL), and Johnson's \u201csmallest diameter\u201d clustering were used to create two\u2010dimensional cluster\u2010enhanced maps. Congruence between maps of cocitations and similarity judgments was assessed using canonical correlation of the spatial coordinates of points (authors) in each of a given pair of maps. Two significant canonical correlations were found in each test. The majority of clusters appeared in both cocitation and judgment maps. In macroeconomics, differences between maps and clusters represent the influence, on judgments, of individual authors' perceived policy orientation. In Drosophila genetics, major differences arise from a time lag in the incorporation of authors' recent work in the formal literature. Cocited author mapping is a valid representation of the intellectual structure in both macroeconomics and Drosophila genetics. \u00a9 1986 John Wiley & Sons, Inc."

The raw data for the narrative are the Science Citation Index and selected texts from the published scientific literature. The review process is modeled as a walk through a co\u2010citation network using a quasi\u2010minimal spanning tree path and a depth\u2010first search method. Text for the narrative is derived from a statistical analysis of passages which cite the core (highly cited) documents in the cluster. A method is devised for selecting the passage which is most representative of the citing passages for a specific core document using shared content words. This is called the consensus passage. Transitions between nodes in the network are derived from an analysis of co\u2010citing contexts, which reveal why the concepts represented by the documents are associated. The final specialty narrative consists of consensus passages ordered by the tree search, and connected to one another by transitional sentences. The method is applied to a co\u2010citation cluster in the field of cancer virology, and the resulting specialty narrative is described in relation to the structure of the original co\u2010citation map. Implications of the procedure for the cognitive processes involved in reviewing a field, and the extension of the method to other fields and higher level maps of science are discussed. \u00a9 1986 John Wiley & Sons, Inc."

                "text": "As a communications system, the network of journals that play a paramount role in the exchange of scientific and technical information is little understood. Periodically since 1927, when Gross and Gross published their study (1) of references in 1 year\u2019s issues of the Journal of the American Chemical Socie/y, pieces of the network have been illuminated by the work of Bradford (2), Allen (3), Gross and Woodford (4), Hooker (5), Henkle (6), Fussier (7), Brown (8), and others (9). Nevertheless, there is still no map of the journal network as a whok. To date, studies of the network and of the interrelation of its components have been limited in the number of journak, the areas of scientific study, and the periods of time their authors were able to consider, Such shortcomings have not been due to any lack of purpose, insight, or energy on the part of investigators, but to the practical difficulty of compiling and manipulating manually the enormous amount of necessary data. A solution to this problem of data is available in the data base used to produce the Science Citation Index ( SCI ) (10). The coverage of the SCI is international and multidisciplinary; it has grown from 600 journals in 1964 to 2400 journals in 1972, and now includes the world\u2019s most important scientific and technical journals in mow disciplines. The SCI is published quarterly and is cumulated annually and quinquennially, but the data base from which the volumes are compiled is maintained on magnetic tape and is updated weekly. At the end of 1971, this data base contained more than 27 mi[tion references to about 10 million different published items. These references appeared over the past decade in the footnotes and bibliographies of more than 2 million journal articles, communications, letters, and so on. The data base is, thus, not only multidisciplinary, it covers a substantial period of time and, being in machine-readable form, is amenable to extensive manipulation by computer. In 1971, the Institute for Scientfic Information (1S1) decided to undertake a systematic analysis of journal citation patterns across the whole of science and technology. It began by extracting from the data base all references pobIished during the last quarter of 1969 in the 2200 journals then covered by the SCL The resultant sample was about 1 million citations of journals, books, reports, theses, and so forth. To test whether this 3-month sample was representative of the year as a whole, it was matched against another sample made by selecting every 27th reference from the approximately 4 million references collected over the entire year. The two samples were similar enough in scope (number of diflerent items cited) and detail (relative frequency of their citation by different journals) to"

The co-citation frequency of two scientific papers can be determined by comparing lists of citing documents in the Science Citation Index and counting identical entries. Networks of co-cited papers can be generated for specific scientific specialties, and an example is drawn from the literature of particle physics. Co-citation patterns are found to differ significantly from bibliographic coupling patterns, but to agree generally with patterns of direct citation. Clusters of co-cited papers provide a new way to study the specialty structure of science. They may provide a new approach to indexing and to the creation of SDI profiles."

The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents (\u201csemantic structure\u201d) in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising."

One solution to this problem is improved authoring to create more comprehensible structures. This paper proposes several authoring tools, based on hypertext structure analysis.\nIn many hypertext systems authors are encouraged to create hierarchical structures, but when writing, the hierarchy is lost because of the inclusion of cross-reference links. The first part of this paper looks at ways of recovering lost hierarchies and finding new ones, offering authors different views of the same hypertext. The second part helps authors by identifying properties of the hypertext document. Multiple metrics are developed including compactness and stratum. Compactness indicates the intrinsic connectedness of the hypertext, and stratum reveals to what degree the hypertext is organized so that some nodes must be read before others.\nSeveral existing hypertexts are used to illustrate the benefits of each technique. The collection of techniques provides a multifaceted view of the hypertext, which should allow authors to reduce undesired structural complexity and create documents that readers can traverse more easily."

Our content-link clustering algorithm is based on the semantic information embedded in hyperlink structures and document contents. HyPursuit admits multiple, coexisting cluster hierarchies based on different principles for grouping documents, such as the Library of Congress catalog scheme and automatically created hypertext clusters. HyPursuit\u2019s abstraction functions summarize cluster contents to support scalable query processing. The abstraction functions satisfy system resource limitations with controlled information 10SS. The result of query processing operations on a cluster summary approximates the result of performing the operations on the entire information space. We constructed a prototype system comprising 100 leaf WorldWide Web sites and a hierarchy of 42 servers that route queries to the leaf sites. Experience with our system suggests that abstraction functions based on hypertext clustering can be used to construct meaningful and scalable cluster hierarchies. We are also encouraged by preliminary results on clustering based on both document contents and hyperlink structures."

These methods are important components of many scientific numerical algorithms and have been demonstrated by experiment to work extremely well. In this paper, we show that spectral partitioning methods work well on bounded-degree planar graphs and finite element meshes-the classes of graphs to which they are usually applied. While active spectral bisection does not necessarily work, we prove that spectral partitioning techniques can be used to produce separators whose ratio of vertices removed to edges cut is O(/spl radic/n) for bounded-degree planar graphs and two-dimensional meshes and O(n/sup 1/d/) for well-shaped d-dimensional meshes. The heart of our analysis is an upper bound on the second-smallest eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrices of these graphs: we prove a bound of O(1/n) for bounded-degree planar graphs and O(1/n/sup 2/d/) for well-shaped d-dimensional meshes."

While this property probably relates to the explosive acceptance of the Web, it further complicates the already difficult problem of identifying usable structures and aggregates in large hypertext collections. These reduced structures, or localities, form the basis for simplifying visualizations of and navigation through complex hypertext systems. Much of the previous research into identifying aggregates utilize graph theoretic algorithms based upon structural topology, i.e., the linkages between items. Other research has focused on content analysis to form document collections. This paper presents our exploration into techniques that utilize both the topology and textual similarity between items as well as usage data collected by servers and page meta-information lke title and size. Linear equations and spreading activation models are employed to arrange Web pages based upon functional categories, node types, and relevancy."

Several large empirical studies have revealed common patterns of surfing behavior. A model that assumes that users make a sequence of decisions to proceed to another page, continuing as long as the value of the current page exceeds some threshold, yields the probability distribution for the number of pages that a user visits within a given Web site. This model was verified by comparing its predictions with detailed measurements of surfing patterns. The model also explains the observed Zipf-like distributions in page hits observed at Web sites."

Objections to its use fall into two main categories: first, that clustering is too slow for large corpora (with running time often quadratic in the number of documents); and second, that clustering does not appreciably improve retrieval.\nWe argue that these problems arise only when clustering is used in an attempt to improve conventional search techniques. However, looking at clustering as an information access tool in its own right obviates these objections, and provides a powerful new access paradigm. We present a document browsing technique that employs document clustering as its primary operation. We also present fast (linear time) clustering algorithms which support this interactive browsing paradigm."
