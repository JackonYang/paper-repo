The operators are the first derivatives of 2-dimensional Gaussians with different widths whose positive and negative parts are separately normalized to +1 and -1, respectively. The responses of the convolution of this 2-dimensional gradient operator with a gray value picture are vectors whose magnitudes and phases give useful information about differences of mean gray values across contours, and about the exact direction of the maximal intensity changes. Closed chains of contour points define regions whose gray values can be reconstructed approximately from the attributes of contour points. The regions of the segmented pictures are appropriate features which facilitate the matching process with scene models."

                "text": "A theory of edge detection is presented. The analysis proceeds in two parts. (1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

We argue that the limit, as we approach arbitrarily close to either side of an edge, of such image parameters as type of texture, texture gradient, color, appropriate directional derivatives of intensity, etc., is a key aspect of this structure. However, the general problem of capturing this local structure is surprisingly complex. Thus, we restrict ourselves in this paper to a relatively simple domain\u00bfone-dimensional cuts through idealized images modeled by piecewise smooth (C1) functions corrupted by Gaussian noise. Within this domain, we define local structure to be the limit of the uncorrupted intensity and of its derivatives as we approach arbitrarily close to either side of a discontinuity. We develop a technique that captures this local structure while simultaneously locating the discontinuities, and demonstrate that these tasks are in fact inseparable. The technique is an extension, using estimation theory, of the classical definition of discontinuity. It handles, in a consistent fashion, both jump discontinuities in the function and jump discontinuities in its first derivative (so-called step-edges are a special case of the former and roof-edges of the latter). It also integrates, again in a consistent fashion, information derived from a number of different neighborhood sizes."

Edge detection operators are typically designed to optimally estimate first or second derivative over some (usually small) support. Other criteria such as output signal to noise ratio or bandwidth have also been been argued for. This thesis is an attempt to formulate a set of edge detection criteria that capture as directly as possible the desirable properties of an edge operator. Variational techniques are used to find a solution over the space of all linear shift invariant operators. The first criterion is that the detector have low probability of error i.e. failing to mark edges or falsely marking non-edges. The second is that the marked points should b The third criterion is that there should be low probability of more than one response to a single edge. The technique is used to find optimal operators for step edges and for extended impulse profiles (ridges or valleys in two dimensions). The extension of the one dimensional operators to two dimensions is then discussed. The result is a set of operators of varying width, length and orientation. The problem of combining these outputs into a single description is discussed, and a set of heuristics for the integration are given. (Author)"

There is also enough information in \u00bff to find regions of high curvature (i.e., high curvature of the level paths of f). For color images, we use the vector field V = (I, Q). In application, the image is partitioned into a grid of squares. On the boundary of each square, V/|V| is sampled, and these unit vectors are used as the tangents of a curve \u00bf. The rotation number (or topological degree) \u00bf(\u00bf) and the average curvature f|\u00bf\u00bf| are computed for each square. Analysis of these numbers yields infor-mation on edges and curvature. Experimental results from both simu-lated and real data are described."

A critical, intermediate goal of edge detection is the detection and characterization of significant intensity changes. This paper discusses this part of the edge detection problem. To characterize the types of intensity changes derivatives of different types, and possibly different scales, are needed. Thus, we consider this part of edge detection as a problem in numerical differentiation. We show that numerical differentiation of images is an ill-posed problem in the sense of Hadamard. Differentiation needs to be regularized by a regularizing filtering operation before differentiation. This shows that this part of edge detection consists of two steps, a filtering step and a differentiation step. Following this perspective, the paper discusses in detail the following theoretical aspects of edge detection. 1) The properties of different types of filters-with minimal uncertainty, with a bandpass spectrum, and with limited support-are derived. Minimal uncertainty filters optimize a tradeoff between computational efficiency and regularizing properties. 2) Relationships among several 2-D differential operators are established. In particular, we characterize the relation between the Laplacian and the second directional derivative along the gradient. Zero crossings of the Laplacian are not the only features computed in early vision. 3) Geometrical and topological properties of the zero crossings of differential operators are studied in terms of transversality and Morse theory."

The essence of the facet model is that any analysis made on the basis of the pixel values in some neighborhood has its final authoritative interpretation relative to the underlying gray tone intensity surface of which the neighborhood pixel values are observed noisy samples. With regard to edge detection, we define an edge to occur in a pixel if and only if there is some point in the pixel's area having a negatively sloped zero crossing of the second directional derivative taken in the direction of a nonzero gradient at the pixel's center. Thus, to determine whether or not a pixel should be marked as a step edge pixel, its underlying gray tone intensity surface must be estimated on the basis of the pixels in its neighborhood. For this, we use a functional form consisting of a linear combination of the tensor products of discrete orthogonal polynomials of up to degree three. The appropriate directional derivatives are easily computed from this kind of a function. Upon comparing the performance of this zero crossing of second directional derivative operator with the Prewitt gradient operator and the Marr-Hildreth zero crossing of the Laplacian operator, we find that it is the best performer; next is the Prewitt gradient operator. The Marr-Hildreth zero crossing of the Laplacian operator performs the worst."

                "text": "The visual system is considered as an information processing system where the information processing task may consist in the localization and recognition of objects in the 3-dimensional physical world. After some definitions concerning terms like physical world and its projection, image,feature, and segmentation the processing in the first stages of the visual system (low-level vision) is discussed. A computational theory of retinal filtering is presented and related to the anatomy and physiology of the retina as well as to psychophysical results suggesting that a spatial-frequency filtering is performed in the human visual system. Furthermore neurophysiological and psycho-physical data suggest that the segmentation is the next stage after retinal processing. Here surface elements are extracted which follow from motion, texture, or the depth of objects (Stereopsis) relative to the observer. Some results of our simulation of low-level vision (retina, primary visual cortex) are presented for natural images. Particularly these results are related to the extraction of contour points, and edges for the reconstruction of the original gray values and the description of forms, and to the evaluation of statistical parameters for the description of textures in different spatial-frequency domains."

The central problem in structural pattern matching is to determine the correspondence between the symbols which comprise a model and symbols which describe a pattern. The difficulty of determining this correspondence depends critically on the representation that is used to describe patterns. This correspondence presents a probabilistic representation for structural models of pattern classes. Both pattern descriptions and models for pattern classes are based on symbols which represent grayscale information at multiple resolutions. A pattern description is given by a tree of symbols with attribute values. Structural models are represented by a tree of symbols with probabilistic attributes. The position and scale (resolution) of the symbols, as well as other ``features,'' are represented by these attributes. An algorithm is presented for determining the correspondence between symbols in a description of a pattern and symbols in a model of a pattern class. This algorithm uses the connectivity between symbols at different scales to constrain the search for correspondence. An interactive training program for learning models of pattern classes is described, and some conclusions from the work are presented."

A fundamental problem in computing such descriptions is scale: a derivative must be taken over some neighborhood, but there is seldom a principled basis for choosing its size. Scale-space filtering is a method that describes signals qualitatively, managing the ambiguity of scale in an organized and natural way. The signal is first expanded by convolution with gaussian masks over a continuum of sizes. This \"scale-space\" image is then collapsed, using its qualitative structure, into a tree providing a concise but complete qualitative description covering all scales of observation. The description is further refined by applying a stability criterion, to identify events that persist of large changes in scale."

Most processes of early vision such as stereomatching, computation of motion and all the ``structure from\" processes can be regarded as solutions to inverse problems. This common characteristic of early vision can be formalized---{\\it most early vision problems are ``ill-posed problems\" in the sense of Hadamard}. We will show that a mathematical theory developed for regularizing ill-posed problems leads in a natural way to the solution of early vision problems in terms of variational principles of a certain class. This is a new theoretical framework for some of the variational solutions already obtained in the analysis of early vision processes. It also shows how several other problems in early vision can be approached and solved."
