Most cells responded selectively to the spatial frequency of the sine-wave gratings. 4. The spatial frequency of the sine-wave grating eliciting the optimal response could not be predicted from the organization of the receptive field of each cell as determined by stationary or moving stimuli. 5. The sharpness of spatial-frequency selectivity is only slightly more pronounced in S-type cells than in CX-type cells. 6. S-type and CX-type cells differ significantly in the temporal modulation of their discharges to gratings. S-type cells discharge in sharp bursts to each cycle which traverses the receptive field. CX-type cells discharge in a rather continuous fashion. This measure can be used reliably to classify cells as S or CS type."

Cells in visual cortex have been alternately considered as bar and edge detectors, or as spatial\u2010frequency filters responding to the two\u2010dimensional Fourier component of patterns. 2. The responses to gratings and to checkerboards allow one to test these alternate models: the Fourier components of a checkerboard pattern do not occur at the same orientation as the edges, nor do the checkerboard spatial frequencies correspond to the check widths. 3. Knowing the orientation tuning of a cell for gratings, one can precisely predict its orientation tuning to checkerboards from the orientation of the fundamental Fourier components of the patterns, not from the orientation of their edges. This was found for both square and rectangular checkerboards, and held for both simple and complex cortical cells. 4. Knowing the spatial tuning of a cell for sine\u2010wave gratings, one can precisely predict its spatial tuning to square and rectangular checkerboards from the spatial frequencies of the fundamental Fourier components of the patterns, not from the widths of their checks. 5. When presented with checkerboards in which not the fundamental but the upper harmonics were within its spatial bandpass, a cell's orientation tuning was found to be predictable from the (quite different) orientation of the higher Fourier harmonic components, but not from the orientation of the edges. 6. Knowing a cell's contrast sensitivity for gratings, one can predict the cell's contrast sensitivity for checkerboards much more accurately from the amplitudes of the two\u2010dimensional Fourier components of the patterns than from the contrasts of the patterns. 7. The orientation tuning, spatial\u2010frequency tuning and responsiveness of cells to a plaid pattern were also found to be predictable from the pattern's two\u2010dimensional Fourier spectrum. 8. Both simple and complex striate cortex cells can thus be characterized as two\u2010dimensional spatial\u2010frequency filters. Since different cells responsive to the same region in the visual field are tuned to different spatial frequencies and orientations, the ensemble of such cells would fairly precisely encode the two\u2010dimensional Fourier spectrum of a patch of visual space."

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

Complex cells in cortical areas 17 and 18 of the cat have been studied in response to narrow slits and edges moving across the receptive field in the preferred direction and also to stationary slits of different widths. 2. Average response histograms, recorded as a narrow slit was moved across the receptive field, displayed a periodic series of peaks above a base line level. The response histogram for most area 17 and 18 cells contained five principal peaks; sometimes one or two weaker peaks were present at receptive field borders. The histogram for one cell located at the area 17\u201318 border showed thirteen distinct peaks. Periodic response patterns were also generated as an extended edge was moved across the receptive field. Plots of cell responses versus slit width for stationary slits of different widths also indicated periodic response pattern. 3. The accuracy of determining the preferred slit orientation was the single most important requirement for demonstrating the periodic response pattern. Significant changes in the appearance of the periodic pattern occurred even upon 5 degrees rotations away from the preferred orientation. 4. Average response histograms were also studied over a wide range of moving slit velocities. The number of peaks across corresponding spacings within the recewptive field remained constant over a range of velocities. Response amplitudes, however, were velocity dependent. Thus the response peaks remain associated with fixed positions within visual space independent of stimulus velocity, even though temporal as well as spatial factors may be involved in response selectivity and the periodic modulation. The most striking periodic response histograms were generated at the velocities which produced the greatest cell firing rates. Area 17 complex cells responded well to velocities of less than 0\u20135 degrees to 6\u20130 degrees/sec, but cells in area 18 generally required higher velocities, sometimes as high as 20 degrees\u2010\u201030 degrees/sec, for a good response. 5. Spatial frequencies for the periodic component of the receptive field for area 17 cells in the central visual area covered a range of three octaves up to 5 cycles/degree, and area 18 cells included another octave on the low frequency side. The spatial frequency of a cell was found to be roughly inversely proportional to the receptive field width. Only a small sample of area 18 cells was studied, but these cells tended to represent low spatial frequencies and to respond selectively to high velocity stimuli..."

Sharpness of orientation selectivity was greater for simple (S type) than for complex (CX type) cells. CX-type cells became more broadly tuned in the deeper cortical layers: S-type cells were equally well tuned throughout the cortex. 3. Sharpness of orientation selectivity for S-type cells was similar at all retinal eccentricities studied (0 degrees - 20 degrees from the fovea):in CX-type cells orientation selectivity decreased slightly with increasing eccentricity. 4. The orientation tuning of binocular cells was similar when mapped separately through each eye. 5. Orientation selectivity and direction selectivity are independent of each other, suggesting that separate neural mechanisms give rise to them. 6. More CX-type cells can be binocularly activated than S-type cells (88% versus 49%). The ocular dominance of S-type cells is similar in all cortical layers: for CX-type cells there is an increase in the number of cells in ocular-dominance category 4 in layers 5 and 6."

In an extensive experiment with f = 14 cycles/deg, the independence hypothesis was consistently rejected only when f/f\u2032=54 or 45, but rarely rejected when the value of f/f\u2032 lay outside this range.

                "text": "THE MANNER IN WHICH single units of the primate striate cortex respond to natural, visual stimuli has been described both for anesthetized (17, 26) and unanesthetized preparations (12, 30, 36, 44). Only Poggio (36), however, has examined the fovea1 representation in unanesthetized, painlessly immobilized monkevs where full control of visual stimulation \u2018could be maintained. His analysis concentrated on the spatial properties of the effective stimuli. Several units were found to change their characteristics during the course of analysis, thus raising the possibility that the processes of \u201cfeature extraction,\u201d if they in fact exist, may be more dynamic than they appear to be under anesthesia. Using a preparation similar to Poggio\u2019s, we have looked at this system in a somewhat different manner. First, besides determining the effective spatial properties of the stimulus, whenever possible we have also determined the latency of response to stroboscopic flashes and to electrical stimulation of optic tract (OT) or optic radiation (OR), We hoped thereby to assess to some degree the directness of the afferent access to different classes of units. Second, we have examined the response to diffuse illumination at various intensities. This has revealed a type of unit heretofore unrecognized in striate cortex of any species and which, surprisingly, constituted more than one-third of the units in the fovea1 representation in striate cortex of the unanesthetized squirrel monkey. We have termed this new class of units \u201cluxotonic\u201dl to re-"
