The algorithms are the well-known Gradient Descent (GD) algorithm and a new algorithm, which we call EG(+/-). They both maintain a weight vector using simple updates. For the GD algorithm, the update is based on subtracting the gradient of the squared error made on a prediction. The EG(+/-) algorithm uses the components of the gradient in the exponents of factors that are used in updating the weight vector multiplicatively. We present worst-case loss bounds for EG(+/-) and compare them to previously known bounds for the GD algorithm. The bounds suggest that the losses of the algorithms are in general incomparable, but EG(+/-) has a much smaller loss if only a few components of the input are relevant for the predictions. We have performed experiments, which show that our worst-case upper bounds are quite tight already on simple artificial data."

We show worst-case bounds on the sum of the squared prediction errors under various assumptions concerning the amount of a priori information about the sequence to predict. The algorithms we use are variants and extensions of on-line gradient descent. Whereas our algorithms always predict using linear functions as hypotheses, none of our results requires the data to be linearly related. In fact, the bounds proved on the total prediction loss are typically expressed as a function of the total loss of the best fixed linear predictor with bounded norm. All the upper bounds are tight to within constants. Matching lower bounds are provided in some cases. Finally, we apply our results to the problem of on-line prediction for classes of smooth functions."

For a sequence of trials, we compute total losses for both the algorithm and the experts under a loss function. At the end of the trial sequence, we compare the total loss of the algorithm to the total loss of the best expert, i.e., the expert with the least loss on the particular trial sequence. We show that for a large class of loss functions, with binary outcomes the total loss of the algorithm proposed by Vovk exceeds the total loss of the best expert at most by the amount c ln N, where c is a constant determined by the loss function. This upper bound does not depend on any assumptions on how the experts'' predictions or the outcomes are generated, and the trial sequence can be arbitrarily long. We give a straightforward method for finding the correct value c and show by a lower bound that for this value of c, the upper bound is asymptotically tight. The lower bound is based on a probabilistic adversary argument. The class of loss functions for which the c ln N upper bound holds includes the square loss, the logarithmic loss, and the Hellinger loss. We also consider another class of loss functions, including the absolute loss, for which we have an Omega((l log N)^(1/2)) lower bound, where l is the number of trials. We show that for the square and logarithmic loss functions, Vovk''s algorithm achieves the same worst-case upper bounds with continuous-valued outcomes as with binary outcomes. For the absolute loss, we show how bounds earlier achieved for binary outcomes can be achieved with continuous-valued outcomes using a slightly more complicated algorithm."

Our analysis is for worst-case situations, i.e., we make no assumptions about the way the sequence of bits to be predicted is generated. We measure the performance of the algorithm by the difference between the expected number of mistakes it makes on the bit sequence and the expected number of mistakes made by the best expert on this sequence, where the expectation is taken with respect to the randomization in the predictions. We show that the minimum achievable difference is on the order of the square root of the number of mistakes of the best expert, and we give efficient algorithms that achieve this. Our upper and lower bounds have matching leading constants in most cases. We then show how this leads to certain kinds of pattern recognition/learning algorithms with performance bounds that improve on the best results currently known in this context. We also extend our analysis to the case in which log loss is used instead of the expected number of mistakes."

                "text": "We consider a problem of learning from examples. In each of a sequence of trials the learner observes an instance to be classified and must respond with a prediction of its correct classification. Following the prediction the learner is told the correct response. We consider the two category case, and work for the most part with instances composed of a number of Boolean attributes or, more generally, chosen from (0, 1) $\\sp{n}$. Initially, we assume that the correct response in each trial is a function of the corresponding instance, this target function being chosen from some target class of $\\{0,1\\}$-valued functions. We relax this assumption somewhat later. \nWe focus on evaluation of on-line predictive performance, counting the number of mistakes made by the learner during the learning process. For certain target classes we have found algorithms for which we can prove excellent mistake bounds, using no probabilistic assumptions. In the first part of the dissertation we study the properties of such worst-case mistake bounds. \nIn the central part of this dissertation, we present a group of linear-threshold algorithms that are particularly well suited to circumstances in which most of the attributes of the instances are irrelevant to determining the correct predictions. For target classes that can be handled by these algorithms, we show that the worst-case mistake bounds grow only logarithmically with the number of irrelevant attributes. We demonstrate that these algorithms have some measure of robustness in the face of anomalies in the training data caused, for example, by noise. \nWe also consider the implications of on-line, worst-case mistake bounds for learning in a batch setting with probabilistic assumptions, making use of the probabilistic PAC-learning model introduced by Valiant (Va184). We present an analysis that shows that a straightforward transformation applied to mistake bounded algorithms, consisting of adding a hypothesis testing phase, produces algorithms that have asymptotically optimal PAC-learning bounds for certain target classes."

A simple and effective method, based on weighted voting, is introduced for constructing a compound algorithm in such a circumstance. It is called the weighted majority algorithm and is shown to be robust with respect to errors in the data. Various versions of the weighted majority algorithm are discussed, and error bounds for them that are closely related to the error bounds of the best algorithms of the pool are proved.<<ETX>>"

The methods in this paper lead to a unified treatment of some of Valiant's results, along with previous results on distribution-free convergence of certain pattern recognition algorithms. It is shown that the essential condition for distribution-free learnability is finiteness of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, a simple combinatorial parameter of the class of concepts to be learned. Using this parameter, the complexity and closure properties of learnable classes are analyzed, and the necessary and sufficient conditions are provided for feasible learnability."
