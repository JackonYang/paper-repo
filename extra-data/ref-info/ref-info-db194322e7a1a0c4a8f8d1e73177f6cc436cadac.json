Therefore, the BioCreative organizers posed the CHEMDNER (chemical compound and drug name recognition) community challenge, which promoted the development of novel, competitive and accessible chemical text mining systems. This task allowed a comparative assessment of the performance of various methodologies using a carefully prepared collection of manually labeled text prepared by specially trained chemists as Gold Standard data. We evaluated two important aspects: one covered the indexing of documents with chemicals (chemical document indexing - CDI task), and the other was concerned with finding the exact mentions of chemicals in text (chemical entity mention recognition - CEM task). 27 teams (23 academic and 4 commercial, a total of 87 researchers) returned results for the CHEMDNER tasks: 26 teams for CEM and 23 for the CDI task. Top scoring teams obtained an F-score of 87.39% for the CEM task and 88.20% for the CDI task, a very promising result when compared to the agreement between human annotators (91%). The strategies used to detect chemicals included machine learning methods (e.g. conditional random fields) using a variety of features, chemistry and drug lexica, and domain-specific rules. We expect that the tools and resources resulting from this effort will have an impact in future developments of chemical text mining applications and will form the basis to find related chemical information for the detected entities, such as toxicological or pharmacogenomic properties."

The presented conditional random fields (CRF)-based named entity recogniser employs a statistical model trained on domain-specific features, in addition to those typically used in biomedical NERs. In order to increase recall, two heuristics-based post-processing steps were introduced, namely, abbreviation recognition and re-labelling based on a token\u2019s chemical segment composition. The chemical NER was used to generate predictions for both the Chemical Entity Mention recognition (CEM) and Chemical Document Indexing (CDI) subtasks of the challenge. Results obtained from training a model on the provided training set and testing on the development set show that employing chemistryspecific features and heuristics leads to an increase in performance in both subtasks."

But due to the diversity of naming conventions and traditions for such molecules, this task is highly complex and should be supported by computational tools.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe present ChemSpot, a named entity recognition (NER) tool for identifying mentions of chemicals in natural language texts, including trivial names, drugs, abbreviations, molecular formulas and International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry entities. Since the different classes of relevant entities have rather different naming characteristics, ChemSpot uses a hybrid approach combining a Conditional Random Field with a dictionary. It achieves an F(1) measure of 68.1% on the SCAI corpus, outperforming the only other freely available chemical NER tool, OSCAR4, by 10.8 percentage points.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nChemSpot is freely available at: http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/wbi/resources."

The chemistry literature is very rich with information about chemical entities. Extracting molecules and their related properties and activities from the scientific literature to \u201ctext mine\u201d these extracted data and determine contextual relationships helps research scientists, particularly those in drug development. One of the most important challenges in chemical text mining is the recognition of chemical entities mentioned in the texts. In this review, the authors briefly introduce the fundamental concepts of chemical literature mining, the textual contents of chemical documents, and the methods of naming chemicals in documents. We sketch out dictionary-based, rule-based and machine learning, as well as hybrid chemical named entity recognition approaches with their applied solutions. We end with an outlook on the pros and cons of these approaches and the types of chemical entities extracted."

An adjustable threshold allows the system to be tuned to high precision or high recall. At a threshold set for balanced precision and recall, we were able to extract named entities at an F score of 80.7% from chemistry papers and 83.2% from PubMed abstracts. Furthermore, we were able to achieve 57.6% and 60.3% recall at 95% precision, and 58.9% and 49.1% precision at 90% recall.ConclusionThese results show that chemical named entities can be extracted with good performance, and that the properties of the extraction can be tuned to suit the demands of the task."

                "text": "Motivation: Chemical compounds like small signal molecules or other biological active chemical substances are an important entity class in life science publications and patents. Several representations and nomenclatures for chemicals like SMILES, InChI, IUPAC or trivial names exist. Only SMILES and InChI names allow a direct structure search, but in biomedical texts trivial names and Iupac like names are used more frequent. While trivial names can be found with a dictionary-based approach and in such a way mapped to their corresponding structures, it is not possible to enumerate all IUPAC names. In this work, we present a new machine learning approach based on conditional random fields (CRF) to find mentions of IUPAC and IUPAC-like names in scientific text as well as its evaluation and the conversion rate with available name-to-structure tools. Results: We present an IUPAC name recognizer with an F1 measure of 85.6% on a MEDLINE corpus. The evaluation of different CRF orders and offset conjunction orders demonstrates the importance of these parameters. An evaluation of hand-selected patent sections containing large enumerations and terms with mixed nomenclature shows a good performance on these cases (F1 measure 81.5%). Remaining recognition problems are to detect correct borders of the typically long terms, especially when occurring in parentheses or enumerations. We demonstrate the scalability of our implementation by providing results from a full MEDLINE run. Availability: We plan to publish the corpora, annotation guideline as well as the conditional random field model as a UIMA component. Contact:roman.klinger@scai.fraunhofer.de"

                "text": "BackgroundBiomedical named entity recognition (Bio-NER) is a challenging problem because, in general, biomedical named entities of the same category (e.g., proteins and genes) do not follow one standard nomenclature. They have many irregularities and sometimes appear in ambiguous contexts. In recent years, machine-learning (ML) approaches have become increasingly common and now represent the cutting edge of Bio-NER technology. This paper addresses three problems faced by ML-based Bio-NER systems. First, most ML approaches usually employ singleton features that comprise one linguistic property (e.g., the current word is capitalized) and at least one class tag (e.g., B-protein, the beginning of a protein name). However, such features may be insufficient in cases where multiple properties must be considered. Adding conjunction features that contain multiple properties can be beneficial, but it would be infeasible to include all conjunction features in an NER model since memory resources are limited and some features are ineffective. To resolve the problem, we use a sequential forward search algorithm to select an effective set of features. Second, variations in the numerical parts of biomedical terms (e.g., \"2\" in the biomedical term IL2) cause data sparseness and generate many redundant features. In this case, we apply numerical normalization, which solves the problem by replacing all numerals in a term with one representative numeral to help classify named entities. Third, the assignment of NE tags does not depend solely on the target word's closest neighbors, but may depend on words outside the context window (e.g., a context window of five consists of the current word plus two preceding and two subsequent words). We use global patterns generated by the Smith-Waterman local alignment algorithm to identify such structures and modify the results of our ML-based tagger. This is called pattern-based post-processing.ResultsTo develop our ML-based Bio-NER system, we employ conditional random fields, which have performed effectively in several well-known tasks, as our underlying ML model. Adding selected conjunction features, applying numerical normalization, and employing pattern-based post-processing improve the F-scores by 1.67%, 1.04%, and 0.57%, respectively. The combined increase of 3.28% yields a total score of 72.98%, which is better than the baseline system that only uses singleton features.ConclusionWe demonstrate the benefits of using the sequential forward search algorithm to select effective conjunction feature groups. In addition, we show that numerical normalization can effectively reduce the number of redundant and unseen features. Furthermore, the Smith-Waterman local alignment algorithm can help ML-based Bio-NER deal with difficult cases that need longer context windows."

This has created a need for a freely-available, open source system implementing the advances described in the literature. In this paper we present BANNER, an open-source, executable survey of advances in biomedical named entity recognition, intended to serve as a benchmark for the field. BANNER is implemented in Java as a machine-learning system based on conditional random fields and includes a wide survey of the best techniques recently described in the literature. It is designed to maximize domain independence by not employing brittle semantic features or rule-based processing steps, and achieves significantly better performance than existing baseline systems. It is therefore useful to developers as an extensible NER implementation, to researchers as a standard for comparing innovative techniques, and to biologists requiring the ability to find novel entities in large amounts of text."

                "text": "Motivation: Tagging gene and gene product mentions in scientific text is an important initial step of literature mining. In this article, we describe in detail our gene mention tagger participated in BioCreative 2 challenge and analyze what contributes to its good performance. Our tagger is based on the conditional random fields model (CRF), the most prevailing method for the gene mention tagging task in BioCreative 2. Our tagger is interesting because it accomplished the highest F-scores among CRF-based methods and second over all. Moreover, we obtained our results by mostly applying open source packages, making it easy to duplicate our results. Results: We first describe in detail how we developed our CRF-based tagger. We designed a very high dimensional feature set that includes most of information that may be relevant. We trained bi-directional CRF models with the same set of features, one applies forward parsing and the other backward, and integrated two models based on the output scores and dictionary filtering. One of the most prominent factors that contributes to the good performance of our tagger is the integration of an additional backward parsing model. However, from the definition of CRF, it appears that a CRF model is symmetric and bi-directional parsing models will produce the same results. We show that due to different feature settings, a CRF model can be asymmetric and the feature setting for our tagger in BioCreative 2 not only produces different results but also gives backward parsing models slight but constant advantage over forward parsing model. To fully explore the potential of integrating bi-directional parsing models, we applied different asymmetric feature settings to generate many bi-directional parsing models and integrate them based on the output scores. Experimental results show that this integrated model can achieve even higher F-score solely based on the training corpus for gene mention tagging.

                "text": "Nineteen teams presented results for the Gene Mention Task at the BioCreative II Workshop. In this task participants designed systems to identify substrings in sentences corresponding to gene name mentions. A variety of different methods were used and the results varied with a highest achieved F1 score of 0.8721. Here we present brief descriptions of all the methods used and a statistical analysis of the results. We also demonstrate that, by combining the results from all submissions, an F score of 0.9066 is feasible, and furthermore that the best result makes use of the lowest scoring submissions.

S2.2 Background Finding gene names in scientific text is both important and difficult. It is important because it is needed for tasks such as document retrieval, information extraction, summarization, and automated text mining, reasoning, and discovery. Technically, finding gene names in text is a kind of named entity recognition (NER) similar to the tasks of finding person names and company names in newspaper text [1]. However, a combination of characteristics, some of which are common to other domains, makes gene names particularly difficult to recognize automatically. \u2022 Millions of gene names are used. \u2022 New names are created continuously. \u2022 Authors usually do not use proposed standardized names, which means that the name used depends on preference. \u2022 Gene names naturally co-occur with other types, such as cell names, that have similar morphology, and even similar context. \u2022 Expert readers may disagree on which parts of text correspond to a gene name. \u2022 Unlike companies and individuals, genes are not defined unambiguously. A gene name may refer to a specified sequence of DNA base pairs, but that sequence may vary in nonspecific ways, as a result of polymorphism, multiple alleles, translocation, and cross-species analogs. All of these things make gene name finding a unique and persistent problem. An alternative approach to finding gene names in text is to decide upon the actual gene database identifiers that are referenced in a sentence. This is the goal of the gene normalization task [2]. While success in gene normalization to some degree eliminates the need to find explicit gene mentions, it will probably never be the case that gene normalization is more easily achieved. Therefore, the need to find gene mentions will probably continue into the future. Task description BioCreative is a 'challenge evaluation' (competition or contest), in which participants are given well defined text-mining or information extraction tasks in the biological domain. Participants are given a common training corpus, and a period of time to develop systems to carry out the task. At a specified time the participants are then given a test corpus, previously unseen, and a short period of time in which to apply their systems and return the results to the organizers for evaluation. All submissions are then evaluated according to numerical criteria, specified in advance. The results are then returned to the participants and subsequently made public in a workshop and coordinated publication. The first BioCreative challenge was carried out in 2003 (with a workshop in 2004) and consisted of a gene mention task, a gene normalization task and a functional annotation task. The current BioCreative challenge took place in 2006 and the workshop in April of 2007. There were three tasks in 'BioCreative II', called the gene mention (GM), gene normalization (GN) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) tasks. The BioCreative II GM task builds on the similar task from BioCreative I [3]. The training corpus for the current task consists mainly of the training and testing corpora (text collections) from the previous task, and the testing corpus for the current task consists of an additional 5,000 sentences that were held 'in reserve' from the previous task. In the time since the previous challenge, the corpus was reviewed for consistency using a combined automated and manual process. In the previous task, participants were asked to identify gene mentions by giving a range of tokens in the pretokenized sentences of the corpus. In the current corpus, tokenization is not provided; instead participants are asked to identify a gene mention in a sentence by giving its start and end characters. As before, the training set consists of a set of sentences, and for each sentence a set of gene mentions (GENE annotations). Each 'official' GENE annotation in a sentence may optionally have alternate boundaries that are judged by human annotators to be essentially equivalent references (ALTGENE annotations). Every string identified by a run is considered either a true positive or a false positive. If the string matches a GENE or ALTGENE in the humanly annotated corpus, it is counted as a true positive with the exception that only one true positive is permitted per gene given in the corpus. If none of the annotations of a gene given in the corpus match a string nominated by a run, then the gene is counted as a false negative. A run is scored by counting the true positives (TP), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN). Let T = TP + FN denote the total number of genes in the corpus, and let P = TP + FP denote the total number of nominated gene mentions by a run. The evaluation is based on the performance measures p (precision), r (recall), and their harmonic average F: Different applications may favor a different weighting between precision and recall, but this is beyond the scope of our analysis. We assume this simple form of F score in all of our analysis. Despite being called a 'challenge evaluation', competition, or contest, there are several reasons to view the results differently. As is pointed out repeatedly in the TREC workshop [4], the 'absolute value of effectiveness measure is not meaningp TP P"

                "text": "Background:The goal of the gene normalization task is to link genes or gene products mentioned in the literature to biological databases. This is a key step in an accurate search of the biological literature. It is a challenging task, even for the human expert; genes are often described rather than referred to by gene symbol and, confusingly, one gene name may refer to different genes (often from different organisms). For BioCreative II, the task was to list the Entrez Gene identifiers for human genes or gene products mentioned in PubMed/MEDLINE abstracts. We selected abstracts associated with articles previously curated for human genes. We provided 281 expert-annotated abstracts containing 684 gene identifiers for training, and a blind test set of 262 documents containing 785 identifiers, with a gold standard created by expert annotators. Inter-annotator agreement was measured at over 90%.Results:Twenty groups submitted one to three runs each, for a total of 54 runs. Three systems achieved F-measures (balanced precision and recall) between 0.80 and 0.81. Combining the system outputs using simple voting schemes and classifiers obtained improved results; the best composite system achieved an F-measure of 0.92 with 10-fold cross-validation. A 'maximum recall' system based on the pooled responses of all participants gave a recall of 0.97 (with precision 0.23), identifying 763 out of 785 identifiers.Conclusion:Major advances for the BioCreative II gene normalization task include broader participation (20 versus 8 teams) and a pooled system performance comparable to human experts, at over 90% agreement. These results show promise as tools to link the literature with biological databases."

                "text": "Chinese word segmentation is an active area in Chinese language processing though it is suffering from the argument about what precisely is a word in Chinese. Based on corpus-based segmentation standard, we launched this study. In detail, we regard Chinese word segmentation as a character-based tagging problem. We show that there has been a potent trend of using a character-based tagging approach in this field. In particular, learning from segmented corpus with or without additional linguistic resources is treated in a unified way in which the only difference depends on how the feature template set is selected. It differs from existing work in that both feature template selection and tag set selection are considered in our approach, instead of the previous feature template focus only technique. We show that there is a significant performance difference as different tag sets are selected. This is especially applied to a six-tag set, which is good enough for most current segmented corpora. The linguistic meaning of a tag set is also discussed. Our results show that a simple learning system with six n-gram feature templates and a six-tag set can obtain competitive performance in the cases of learning only from a training corpus. In cases when additional linguistic resources are available, an ensemble learning technique, assistant segmenter, is proposed and its effectiveness is verified. Assistant segmenter is also proven to be an effective method as segmentation standard adaptation that outperforms existing ones. Based on the proposed approach, our system provides state-of-the-art performance in all 12 corpora of three international Chinese word segmentation bakeoffs."

PubMed is providing free service to researchers with access to more than 19 million citations for biomedical articles from MEDLINE and life science journals. It is accessed by millions of users each day. Efficient search tools are crucial for biomedical researchers to keep abreast of the biomedical literature relating to their own research. This study provides insight into PubMed users\u2019 needs and their behavior. This investigation was conducted through the analysis of one month of log data, consisting of more than 23 million user sessions and more than 58 million user queries. Multiple aspects of users\u2019 interactions with PubMed are characterized in detail with evidence from these logs. Despite having many features in common with general Web searches, biomedical information searches have unique characteristics that are made evident in this study. PubMed users are more persistent in seeking information and they reformulate queries often. The three most frequent types of search are search by author name, search by gene/protein, and search by disease. Use of abbreviation in queries is very frequent. Factors such as result set size influence users\u2019 decisions. Analysis of characteristics such as these plays a critical role in identifying users\u2019 information needs and their search habits. In turn, such an analysis also provides useful insight for improving biomedical information retrieval. Database URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed"

A maximum entropy tagger is trained on manually annotated data to automatically assign to Chinese characters, or hanzi, tags that indicate the position of a hanzi within a word. The tagged output is then converted into segmented text for evaluation. Preliminary results show that this approach is competitive against other supervised machine-learning segmenters reported in previous studies, achieving precision and recall rates of 95.01% and 94.94% respectively, trained on a 237K-word training set."

Conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."
