When subjects voluntarily directed attention to a peripheral location, we recorded robust and sustained signals uniquely from the intraparietal sulcus (IPs) and superior frontal cortex (near the frontal eye field, FEF). In the ventral IPs and FEF only, the blood oxygen level dependent signal was modulated by the direction of attention. The IPs and FEF also maintained the most sustained level of activation during a 7-sec delay, when subjects maintained attention at the peripheral cued location (working memory). Therefore, the IPs and FEF form a dorsal network that controls the endogenous allocation and maintenance of visuospatial attention. A separate right hemisphere network was activated by the detection of targets at unattended locations. Activation was largely independent of the target's location (visual field). This network included among other regions the right temporo-parietal junction and the inferior frontal gyrus. We propose that this cortical network is important for reorienting to sensory events."

Functional brain imaging studies reveal that, both in the absence and in the presence of visual stimulation, biasing signals due to selective attention can modulate neural activity in visual cortex in several ways. Although the competition among stimuli for representation is ultimately resolved within visual cortex, the source of top-down biasing signals derives from a network of areas in frontal and parietal cortex."

Distinct networks were engaged by attention-directing cues versus subsequent targets. Superior frontal, inferior parietal and superior temporal cortex were selectively activated by cues, indicating that these structures are part of a network for voluntary attentional control. This control biased activity in multiple visual cortical areas, resulting in selective sensory processing of relevant visual targets."

                "text": "Objects play an important role in guiding spatial attention through a cluttered visual environment. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (ER-fMRI) to measure brain activity during cued discrimination tasks requiring subjects to orient attention either to a region bounded by an object (object-based spatial attention) or to an unbounded region of space (location-based spatial attention) in anticipation of an upcoming target. Comparison between the two tasks revealed greater activation when attention selected a region bounded by an object. This activation was strongly lateralized to the left hemisphere and formed a widely distributed network including (a) attentional structures in parietal and temporal cortex and thalamus, (b) ventral-stream object processing structures in occipital, inferior-temporal, and parahippocampal cortex, and (c) control structures in medial-and dorsolateral-prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that object-based spatial selection is achieved by imposing additional constraints over and above those processes already operating to achieve selection of an unbounded region. In addition, ER-fMRI methodology allowed a comparison of validly versus invalidly cued trials, thereby delineating brain structures involved in the reorientation of attention after its initial deployment proved incorrect. All areas of activation that differentiated between these two trial types resulted from greater activity during the invalid trials. This outcome suggests that all brain areas involved in attentional orienting and task performance in response to valid cues are also involved on invalid trials. During invalid trials, additional brain regions are recruited when a perceiver recovers from invalid cueing and reorients attention to a target appearing at an uncued location. Activated brain areas specific to attentional reorientation were strongly right-lateralized and included posterior temporal and inferior parietal regions previously implicated in visual attention processes, as well as prefrontal regions that likely subserve control processes, particularly related to inhibition of inappropriate responding."

This study applied more stringent behavioural and cognitive controls than previously used for similar experiments: (i) subjects were included only if they showed evidence of attentional shifts while performing the task in the magnet; (ii) the experimental task and baseline condition were designed to eliminate the contributions of motor output, visual fixation, inhibition of eye movements, working memory and the conditional (no-go) component of responding. Activations were seen in all three hypothesized cortical epicentres forming a network for spatial attention: the lateral premotor cortex (frontal eye fields), the posterior parietal cortex and the cingulate cortex. Subcortical activations were seen in the basal ganglia and the thalamus. Although the task required attention to be equally shifted to the left and to the right, eight of 10 subjects showed a greater area of activation in the right parietal cortex, consistent with the specialization of the right hemisphere for spatial attention. Other areas of significant activation included the posterior temporo-occipital cortex and the anterior insula. The temporo-occipital activation was within a region broadly defined as MT+ (where MT is the middle temporal area) which contains the human equivalent of area MT in the macaque monkey. This temporo-occipital area appears to constitute a major component of the functional network activated by this spatial attention task. Its activation may reflect the 'inferred' shift of the attentional focus across the visual scene."

                "text": "Visual neglect occurs most frequently and persistently after lesions that include the right supramarginal gyrus (SMG), a part of the inferior parietal lobule. Patients with this syndrome make very few saccades to the left, and show abnormal performance on tasks in which they must covertly shift their attention to the left, suggesting that the right SMG is involved in the generation of saccades and attention shifts. Functional imaging studies of saccades and covert attention shifts in the normal brain, however, have shown weak or absent responses in both SMGs. We used event-related functional MRI to re-examine the responses to saccades and attention shifts within a single experiment, and to assess responses to left- and right-sided stimuli independently. When subjects made saccades to peripheral stimuli, the expected responses were seen in striate and prestriate cortex, the superior parietal lobules, the frontal eye fields, the supplementary motor area and the anterior insulae. In addition there was a response in the right SMG but not in the left SMG, as predicted from the clinical literature. When subjects made a covert visual assessment of the peripheral stimulus without any saccade, greater activity was seen in all of the areas in the frontoparietal network. Each area showed a bias towards contralateral stimuli, with two exceptions: the anterior insulae gave mainly ipsilateral responses, whilst the right SMG gave equal responses to right- and left-sided stimuli. These findings are discussed in the context of current theories pertaining to the clinical syndrome of neglect."

                "text": "1. To understand some of the contributions of parietal cortex to the dynamics of visual spatial attention, we recorded from cortical cells of monkeys performing attentional tasks. We studied 484 neurons in the intraparietal sulcus and adjacent gyral tissue of two monkeys. We measured phasic responses to peripheral visual stimuli while the monkeys attended toward or away from the stimuli or when attention was not controlled. Neurons were tested while the monkeys gazed at a spot of light (simple fixation task), actively attended to a foveal target (foveal attention task), performed a reaction time task (cued reaction time task), made saccadic eye movements to visual targets (saccade task), or responded to a repetitious peripheral target (probability task). 2. In a previous paper we demonstrated that monkeys, like humans, responded more quickly to visual targets when the targets followed briefly flashed visual cues (validly cued targets) (Bowman et al. 1993). It has been hypothesized that the cue attracts attention to its locus and results in faster reaction times (Posner 1980). In the present physiological studies, visual cues consistently excited these neurons when they were flashed in the receptive field. Such activity might signal a shift of attention. Visual targets that fell within the receptive field and that immediately followed the cue evoked relatively weak responses. This response was due to a relative refractory period. 3. Next we tested attentional processes in these tasks that were independent of the visual response to the cue. We placed the cue outside of the receptive field and the target within the receptive field. We found that 23% of these cells had a significant decrease in their firing rate to validly cued targets in their receptive fields under these conditions. Strong responses were evoked by the same target when the cue was flashed in the opposite hemifield (invalidly cued targets). Thus this group of neurons responded best when attention was directed toward the opposite hemifield. 4. For another group of parietal cells (13%) there was an enhanced response to targets in the visual receptive field when the cue was in the same hemifield. For the remaining 64% of the cells there was no significant modulation in this task. 5. The cued reaction time task involved exogenous control of attention; the sensory cue gave spatial and temporal direction to attention. We used several other tasks to test for endogenous control of attention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

On each trial of the visual switching (VS) paradigm, subjects attended to one of two visual stimuli on the basis of either their color or shape. Trials were presented in blocks interleaved with cues instructing subjects to either continue attending to the currently relevant dimension or to switch to the other stimulus dimension. In the response switching (RS) paradigm, subjects made one of two manual responses to the single stimulus presented on each trial. The rules for stimulus\u2013response mapping were reversed on different trials. Trials were presented in blocks interleaved with cues that instructed subjects to either switch stimulus\u2013response mapping rules or to continue with the current rule. Brain activity at \u201cswitch\u201d and \u201cstay\u201d events was compared. The results revealed distinct parietal areas concerned with visual attentional set shifts (VS) and visuomotor intentional set shifts (RS). In VS, activity was recorded in the lateral part of the intraparietal region. In RS, activity was recorded in the posterior medial intraparietal region and adjacent posterior superior and dorsomedial parietal cortex. The results also suggest that the basic functional organization of the intraparietal sulcus and surrounding regions is similar in both macaque and human species."

Either color (red, green) or motion direction (left, right) was cued on mixed scans while only one dimension was cued on blocked scans. An event-related paradigm separated the preparatory activity generated by the cue from the subsequent activity related to the test display. One attentional process specified task information while a second process was motion selective. During the cue period, a pure effect of task specification was observed in left frontal cortex while combined effects of task specification and motion selectivity were observed in left posterior parietal cortex. The frontal task-specification signal may have been the source of the corresponding signal in parietal cortex. Effects of task specification generalized over cue dimension, indicating that the information was coded in a sufficiently abstract form to affect color and motion processing. During the subsequent test period, task-specification and motion-selective signals were again observed in left parietal cortex. Task specification did not significantly affect occipital motion-selective regions, such as MT+, however, indicating that this process did not influence the lower cortical tier of the motion processing stream. These results provide evidence for general and specialized task representations within left parietal cortex during task preparation and execution."

Although symptoms of spatial neglect can result from lesions to other cortical and subcortical areas, patients with posterior parietal lesions are particularly impaired in their ability to disengage and reorient visual attention. Neurophysiological experiments in area 7a of behaving monkeys reveal a large class of neurons that respond to visual stimuli and are powerfully modulated by states of attention. These cells respond better to passive visual stimuli presented during states of attentive fixation than to identical stimuli presented in nonattentive states. The responses of the majority of these cells are also influenced by covert shifts of attention away from the point of fixation; they respond to stimuli presented anywhere within their receptive fields except the covertly attended location. The combined effect of facilitation during attentive fixation and lack of response at the attended location results in a sensitivity for visual stimuli that appear at one location while attention is directed to another. The special sensitivity for unattended stimuli in this group of neurons in area 7a suggests that they may play a role in reorienting attention, possibly by providing signals of the spatial locations of novel stimuli."

The act can be viewed in terms of three internal mental operations: disengagement of attention from its current focus, moving attention to the target, and engagement of the target. Our results show that damage to the parietal lobe produces a deficit in the disengage operation when the target is contralateral to the lesion. Effects may also be found on engagement with the target. The effects of brain injury on disengagement of attention seem to be unique to the parietal lobe and do not appear to occur with our frontal, midbrain, and temporal control series. These results confirm the close connection between parietal lobes and selective attention suggested by single cell recording. They indicate more specifically the role that parietal function has on attention and suggest one mechanism of the effects of parietal lesions reported in clinical neurology."

                "text": "1. Posterior parietal cortex contains neurons that are visually responsive and active in relation to saccadic eye movements. We recorded from single neurons in a subregion of parietal cortex, the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), in alert rhesus monkeys. To characterize more completely the circumstances under which LIP neurons are responsive, we used five tasks designed to test the impact of sensory, motor, and cognitive factors. We obtained quantitative data in multiple tasks in 91 neurons. We measured neural activity during central fixation and in relation to stimulus onset and saccade onset. 2. LIP neurons have visual responses to the onset of a stationary stimulus in the receptive field. These visual responses occurred both in tasks that require a subsequent eye movement toward the stimulus and in tasks in which eye movements are not permitted, indicating that this activity is sensory rather than presaccadic. 3. Visual responses were enhanced when the monkey had to use information provided by the stimulus to guide its behavior. The amplitude of the sensory response to a given stimulus was increased in a task in which the monkey would subsequently make a saccade to the location signaled by the stimulus, as compared with the amplitude of the visual response in a simple fixation task. 4. The visual response was also enhanced when the monkey attended to the stimulus without looking at it. This result shows that enhancement does not reflect saccade preparation because the response is enhanced even when the monkey is not permitted to make a saccade. Instead, enhancement reflects the allocation of attention to the spatial locus of the receptive field. 5. Many LIP neurons had saccade-related activity in addition to their visual responses. The visual response for most neurons was stronger than the saccade-related activation. 6. Saccade-related activity was independent of visual activity. Similar presaccadic activity was observed in trials that included a recent visual stimulus (memory-guided saccade task) and in trials with no visual stimulus (learned saccade task). 7. We observed increases in activity during fixation in tasks in which the monkey could anticipate the onset of a behaviorally significant stimulus. LIP neurons usually showed low levels of background firing in the fixation task during the period before stimulus onset. This background activity was increased in the peripheral attention and memory-guided saccade tasks during the period when the monkey was waiting for a behaviorally relevant stimulus to appear. 8. The results from these several tasks indicate that LIP neurons are activated in a variety of circumstances and are not involved exclusively in sensory processing or motor planning. The modulation of sensory responses by attention and anticipation suggests that cognitive factors play a major role in parietal function."

In three event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, subjects saw an arrow cue that predicted either the direction of motion or the location of a subsequent test stimulus. A reactivation of the BOLD (blood oxygenation level-dependent) signal occurred at the termination of the state of readiness in occipital regions that were transiently activated by the cue and in frontal-parietal regions that maintained an attentional set over the trial. Moreover, a delayed activation occurred in prefrontal and temporo-parietal regions that did not initially respond to the cue and that have been implicated in re-orienting attention to novel sensory events. These latter regions may have generated control signals that ended the state of readiness in regions active during the cue period. These results indicate that terminating a state of readiness produces a widely distributed cortical signal and suggest that areas involved in a preparatory state may be maintained as a network which can be modulated as a whole."

In an event-related functional MRI study, participants performed pairs of two tasks that are either the same (task repetition) or different (task switch) from each other. On half of the trials, foreknowledge about task repetition or task switch was available. On the other half, it was not. Endogenous preparation seems to involve lateral prefrontal cortex (BA 46/45) and posterior parietal cortex (BA 40). During preparation, higher activation increases in inferior lateral prefrontal cortex and superior posterior parietal cortex were associated with foreknowledge than with no foreknowledge. Exogenous adjustment seems to involve superior prefrontal cortex (BA 8) and posterior parietal cortex (BA 39/40) in general. During a task switch with no foreknowledge, activations in these areas were relatively higher than during a task repetition with no foreknowledge. These results suggest that endogenous preparation and exogenous adjustment for a task switch may be independent processes involving different brain areas."

We trained monkeys to make various hand or eye movements and recorded from single neurons in area 7 while the monkeys were performing these tasks. 2. As demonstrated previously ( 19, 20, 46, 47, 63), many cells in area 7 respond to visual stimuli independent of any behavior. The discharge to a stimulus may be enhanced when the animal makes an eye movement to the stimulus. 3. We used two paradigms to study the modulation of visual responses when the animal used a stimulus without making an eye movement. The first was a peripheral-attention task in which the animal had to signal the occurrence of a peripheral stimulus without making an eye movement to it. Half of the cells studied gave an enhanced response in this task. In the second task, the animal had to reach out and touch a stimulus without making an eye movement to it. Visually responsive parietal neurons also yielded enhanced responses in this task. 4. The enhancements demonstrable in the saccade, peripheral-attention, and handreach tasks probably represent the same underlying process because their frequency of occurrence in our sample is almost identical, the intensities are quite similar, and cells that give an enhanced response on one task give an enhanced response in the others. 5. These results show that in posterior parietal cortex, the behavioral enhancement of a visual response is independent of the specific movement used to respond to the stimulus. The physiological mechanism of enhancement, which is movement independent and spatially selective, resembles the psychological phenomenon of selective spatial attention. We suggest that the role of area 7 in visual attention may be mediated by the enhancement of visual responses to selected stimuli."

                "text": "The neurobiology and psychology of attention have much to learn from each other. Neurobiologists recognize that responses in sensory cortex depend on the behavioral relevance of a stimulus, but have few ways to study how perception changes as a result. Psychologists have the conceptual and methodological tools to do just that, but are confounded by the multiple interpretations and theoretical ambiguities. This book attempts to bridge the two fields and to derive a comprehensive theory of attention from both neurobiological and psychological data. It highlights situations where attention can be seen to alter both neural activity and psychophysical performance/phenomenal experience. This \"bicultural\" approach contributes not only to attention research but to the larger goal of linking neural activity to conscious experience. The book focuses mainly on the effects of visual attention on the ventral and dorsal streams of visual cortex in humans and monkeys and the associated changes in visual performance. Several larger findings emerge: attention may involve more than one neural system; attention modulates all stages of cortical visual processing; the effect of attention is constrained by the intrinsic connectivity of cortex and the resulting contextual interactions; and the notion of a \"saliency map\" remains central to thinking about visual attention. The book also considers several approaches to evaluating the same variable through different methods, such as behavioral measurements, functional imaging, and single-unit recording.

                "text": "An anti-saccade, which is a saccade directed toward a mirror-symmetrical position in the opposite visual field relative to the visual stimulus, involves at least three separate operations: covert orienting, response suppression, and coordinate transformation. The distinction between pro- and anti-saccades can also be applied to pointing. We used fMRI to compare patterns of brain activation during pro- and anti-movements, to determine whether or not additional areas become active during the production of anti-movements. In parietal cortex, an inferior network was active during both saccades and pointing that included three foci along the intraparietal sulcus: 1) a posterior superior parietal area (pSPR), more active during the anti-tasks; 2) a middle inferior parietal area (mIPR), active only during the anti-tasks; and 3) an anterior inferior parietal area (aIPR), equally active for pro- and anti-movement. A superior parietal network was active during pointing but not saccades and included the following: 1) a medial region, active during anti- but not pro-pointing (mSPR); 2) an anterior and medial region, more active during pro-pointing (aSPR); and 3) an anterior and lateral region, equally active for pro- and anti-pointing (lSPR). In frontal cortex, areas selectively active during anti-movement were adjacent and anterior to areas that were active during both the anti- and pro-tasks, i.e., were anterior to the frontal eye field and the supplementary motor area. All saccade areas were also active during pointing. In contrast, foci in the dorsal premotor area, the anterior superior frontal region, and anterior cingulate were active during pointing but not saccades. In summary, pointing with central gaze activates a frontoparietal network that includes the saccade network. The operations required for the production of anti-movements recruited additional frontoparietal areas."

The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is well placed to perform this function, because it lies between visual areas, which encode spatial information1,2, and motor cortical areas. The PPC contains several subdivisions, which are generally conceived as high-order sensory areas3,4. Neurons in area 7a and the lateral intraparietal area fire before and during visually guided saccades. Other neurons in areas 7a and 5 are active before and during visually guided arm movements5\u201310. These areas are also active during memory tasks in which the animal remembers the location of a target for hundreds of milliseconds before making an eye or arm movement. Such activity could reflect either visual attention11\u201315 or the intention to make movements16\u201322. This question is difficult to resolve, because even if the animal maintains fixation while directing attention to a peripheral location, the observed neuronal activity could reflect movements that are planned but not executed22. To address this, we recorded from the PPC while monkeys planned either reaches or saccades to a single remembered location. We now report that, for most neurons, activity before the movement depended on the type of movement being planned. We conclude that PPC contains signals related to what the animal intends to do."

Analysis of data at both the group and individual-subject level provided anatomical resolution superior to that described to date. Six right-handed male subjects were selected from a pilot behavioural study in which behavioural responses and eye movements were recorded. The attention tasks involved covert shifts of attention, where peripheral cues indicated the location of subsequent target stimuli to be discriminated. One attention condition emphasized reflexive aspects of spatial orientation, while the other required controlled shifts of attention. PET activations agreed closely with the cortical regions recently proposed to form the core of a neural network for spatial attention. The two attention tasks evoked largely overlapping patterns of neural activation, supporting the existence of a general neural system for visuospatial attention with regional functional specialization. Specifically, neocortical activations were observed in the right anterior cingulate gyrus (Brodmann area 24), in the intraparietal sulcus of right posterior parietal cortex, and in the mesial and lateral premotor cortices (Brodmann area 6)."

Many neurons in parietal, prefrontal and motor cortical areas are activated both by particular movements and by sensory cues that trigger these movements, suggesting a role in linking sensation to action. For example, neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) encode both the location of visual stimuli and the direction of saccadic eye movements. LIP is not believed to encode non-spatial stimulus attributes such as colour. Here we investigated whether LIP would encode colour if colour was behaviourally linked to the eye movement. We trained monkeys to make an eye movement in one of two directions based alternately on the colour or location of a visual cue. When cue colour was relevant for directing eye movement, we found a substantial fraction of LIP neurons selective for cue colour. However, when cue location was relevant, colour selectivity was virtually absent in LIP. These results demonstrate that selectivity of cortical neurons can change as a function of the required behaviour."

The network of brain areas sensitive to the behavioral relevance of multimodal sensory events has not been fully characterized. We used event-related fMRI to identify brain regions responsive to changes in both visual and auditory stimuli when those changes were either behaviorally relevant or behaviorally irrelevant. A widespread network of \"context-dependent\" activations responded to both task-irrelevant and task-relevant events but responded more strongly to task-relevant events. The most extensive activations in this network were located in right and left temporoparietal junction (TPJ), with smaller activations in left precuneus, left anterior insula, left anterior cingulate cortex, and right thalamus. Another network of \"context-independent\" activations responded similarly to all events, regardless of task relevance. This network featured a large activation encompassing left supplementary and cingulate motor areas (SMA/CMA) as well as right IFG, right/left precuneus, and right anterior insula, with smaller activations in right/left inferior temporal gyrus and left posterior cingulate cortex. Distinct context-dependent and context-independent subregions of activation were also found within the left and right TPJ, left anterior insula, and left SMA/CMA. In the right TPJ, a subregion in the supramarginal gyrus showed sensitivity to the behavioral context (i.e., relevance) of stimulus changes, while two subregions in the superior temporal gyrus did not. The results indicate a role for the TPJ in detecting behaviorally relevant events in the sensory environment. The TPJ may serve to identify salient events in the sensory environment both within and independent of the current behavioral context."

In the human, the left hemisphere shifts attention predominantly in the contralateral hemispace and in a contraversive direction whereas the right hemisphere distributes attention more evenly, in both hemispaces and both directions. As a consequence of this asymmetry, severe contralesional neglect occurs almost exclusively after right hemisphere lesions. Patients with left neglect experience a loss of salience in the mental representation and conscious perception of the left side and display a reluctance to direct orientating and exploratory behaviours to the left. Neglect is distributed according to egocentric, allocentric, world-centred, and object-centred frames of reference. Neglected events can continue to exert an implicit influence on behaviour, indicating that the attentional filtering occurs at the level of an internalized representation rather than at the level of peripheral sensory input. The unilateral neglect syndrome is caused by a dysfunction of a large-scale neurocognitive network, the cortical epicentres of which are located in posterior parietal cortex, the frontal eye fields, and the cingulate gyrus. This network coordinates all aspects of spatial attention, regardless of the modality of input or output. It helps to compile a mental representation of extrapersonal events in terms of their motivational salience, and to generate 'kinetic strategies' so that the attentional focus can shift from one target to another."

                "text": "The human visual system is usually confronted with many different objects at a time, with only some of them reaching consciousness. Reaction-time studies have revealed two different strategies by which objects are selected for further processing: an automatic, efficient search process, and a conscious, so-called inefficient search [Treisman, A. (1991). Search, similarity, and integration of features between and within dimensions. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 17, 652-676; Treisman, A., & Gelade, G. (1980). A feature integration theory of attention. Cognitive Psychology, 12, 97-136; Wolfe, J. M. (1996). Visual search. In H. Pashler (Ed.), Attention. London: University College London Press]. Two different theories have been proposed to account for these search processes. Parallel theories presume that both types of search are treated by a single mechanism that is modulated by attentional and computational demands. Serial theories, in contrast, propose that parallel processing may underlie efficient search, but inefficient searching requires an additional serial mechanism, an attentional spotlight (Treisman, A., 1991) that successively shifts attention to different locations in the visual field. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we show that the cerebral networks involved in efficient and inefficient search overlap almost completely. Only the superior frontal region, known to be involved in working memory [Courtney, S. M., Petit, L., Maisog, J. M., Ungerleider, L. G., & Haxby, J. V. (1998). An area specialized for spatial working memory in human frontal cortex. Science, 279, 1347-1351], and distinct from the frontal eye fields, that control spatial shifts of attention, was specifically involved in inefficient search. Activity modulations correlated with subjects' behavior best in the extrastriate cortical areas, where the amount of activity depended on the number of distracting elements in the display. Such a correlation was not observed in the parietal and frontal regions, usually assumed as being involved in spatial attention processing. These results can be interpreted in two ways: the most likely is that visual search does not require serial processing, otherwise we must assume the existence of a serial searchlight that operates in the extrastriate cortex but differs from the visuospatial shifts of attention involving the parietal and frontal regions."

We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to study the performance of a spatial working memory task by humans. We distinguished the maintenance of spatial items from the selection of an item from memory to guide a response. Selection, but not maintenance, was associated with activation of prefrontal area 46 of the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex. In contrast, maintenance was associated with activation of prefrontal area 8 and the intraparietal cortex. The results support a role for the dorsal prefrontal cortex in the selection of representations. This accounts for the fact that this area is activated both when subjects select between items on working memory tasks and when they freely select between movements on tasks of willed action."

Low-frequency responding might provide a minimal condition for eliciting such conflict, as a result of the need to overcome a prepotent response tendency. We predicted that ACC would be selectively engaged during low-frequency responding, irrespective of the specific task situation. To test this hypothesis, we examined ACC activity during the performance of simple choice-discrimination tasks, using rapid event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects were scanned while performing three tasks thought to tap different cognitive processes: 'Go/No-go' (response inhibition), 'oddball' (target detection), and two-alternative forced- choice (response selection). Separate conditions manipulated the frequency of relevant task events. Consistent with our hypothesis, the same ACC region was equally responsive to low-frequency events across all three tasks, but did not show differential responding when events occurred with equal frequency. Subregions of the ACC were also identified that showed heightened activity during the response inhibition condition, and on trials in which errors were committed. Task-sensitive activity was also found in right prefrontal and parietal cortex (response inhibition), left superior temporal and tempoparietal cortex (target detection), and supplementary motor area (response selection). Taken together, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that the ACC serves as a generic detector of processing conflict arising when low-frequency responses must be executed, but also leave open the possibility that further functional specialization may occur within ACC subregions."

                "text": "The physiological basis for the striking decrease of attention to novel events following frontal lobe injury is poorly understood. In this study, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from patients with frontal lobe damage and matched subjects, who controlled the duration of viewing of background, novel and target stimuli. Frontal lobe patients did not differ from normal controls in terms of age, education, estimated IQ or mood. However, they were judged to be more apathetic as measured by self-report and informants' ratings. Patients with frontal lobe damage exhibited markedly reduced amplitude of the novelty P3 response and the duration of viewing of novel stimuli. In contrast, injury to the frontal lobes had a limited impact on P3 amplitude and behavioural responses (viewing duration and reaction time) to target stimuli. A strong correlation was found between measures of apathy and both attenuated P3 amplitude and viewing duration in response to novel but not target stimuli. Differences in amplitude of the novelty P3 response explained a large portion of the variance associated with duration of viewing of novel stimuli. After controlling for the influence of P3 amplitude, there was no association between frontal lobe injury and reduced viewing of novel stimuli. The results of this study suggest that frontal lobe damage leads to diminished visual attention to novel events through its disruption of neural processes underlying the novelty P3 response. These processes appear to regulate the allocation of attentional resources and early exploratory behaviours, and are not limited to immediate orienting responses. Damage to the frontal lobes may prevent the generation of a signal which indicates that a novel event in the environment requires additional attention due to its potential behavioural significance. The disruption of these processes is likely to contribute to the apathy observed in patients after injury to the frontal lobes."

The posterior parietal cortex is crucial for the analysis of space, visual attention and movement. Neurons in one of its subdivisions, the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), have visual responses to stimuli appearing abruptly at particular retinal locations (their receptive fields). We have tested the responses of LIP neurons to stimuli that entered their receptive field by saccades. Neurons had little or no response to stimuli brought into their receptive field by saccades, unless the stimuli were behaviourally significant. We established behavioural significance in two ways: either by making a stable stimulus task-relevant, or by taking advantage of the attentional attraction of an abruptly appearing stimulus. Our results show that under ordinary circumstances the entire visual world is only weakly represented in LIP. The visual representation in LIP is sparse, with only the mostsalient or behaviourally relevant objects being strongly represented."

Its neural basis, however, has remained a mystery. Here, we propose that cognitive control stems from the active maintenance of patterns of activity in the prefrontal cortex that represent goals and the means to achieve them. They provide bias signals to other brain structures whose net effect is to guide the flow of activity along neural pathways that establish the proper mappings between inputs, internal states, and outputs needed to perform a given task. We review neurophysiological, neurobiological, neuroimaging, and computational studies that support this theory and discuss its implications as well as further issues to be addressed"

                "text": "Area V3A is an extrastriate visual area that provides a major input to parietal cortex. To identify the sensory, saccade-related, and cognitive signals carried by V3A neurons, we recorded from single units in alert monkeys during performance of fixation and memory guided saccade tasks. We found that visual responses to stationary stimuli in area V3A were affected by the behavioral relevance of the stimulus. The amplitude of the visual response differed between the memory-guided saccade task, in which the monkey had to use the information provided by the stimulus to guide its behavior, and the fixation task. For 18% (29/163) of V3A neurons, the response was significantly enhanced in the memory-guided saccade task as compared with that in the fixation task. For 8% (13/163) of V3A neurons, the amplitude of response in the memory-guided saccade task was significantly suppressed. We also observed task-related modulation of activity prior to stimulus onset. Among the V3A neurons (37/163) that showed significant differences between tasks in prestimulus activity, the majority (89%; 33/37) showed greater prestimulus activity in the memory-guided saccade task. Task-related increases in prestimulus activity in the memory-guided saccade task were not always matched by increases in the sensory response, indicating that visual responses and prestimulus activity can be modulated independently. Activity in the memory period was suppressed compared with prestimulus activity for 83% (49/59) of the V3A neurons that showed a significant difference in activity (59/197) between these two epochs. For some neurons, memory-period activity dropped even below the baseline level in the fixation task, indicating that there may be an active suppression mechanism. Many V3A neurons (75%, 148/197) also had activity in the saccade epoch. This activity was most prominent immediately after the saccade. Postsaccadic activity was observed even when testing was carried out in total darkness, indicating that this activity reflects, at least in part, extraretinal signals and is not simply a response to visual reafference. These results indicate that several kinds of signals are carried by single neurons in extrastriate area V3A. Moreover, activity in V3A is subject to modulation by extraretinal factors, including attention, anticipation, memory, and saccadic eye movements."

However, the anatomic locations of brain regions involved in this response are not precisely known. In the present event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, methods of stimulus presentation, data acquisition, and data analysis were optimized for the detection of brain activity in response to stimuli presented in the three-stimulus oddball task. This paradigm involves the interleaved, pseudorandom presentation of single block-letter target and distractor stimuli that previously were found to generate the P3b and P3a ERP subcomponents, respectively, and frequent standard stimuli. Target stimuli evoked fMRI signal increases in multiple brain regions including the thalamus, the bilateral cerebellum, and the occipital-temporal cortex as well as bilateral superior, medial, inferior frontal, inferior parietal, superior temporal, precentral, postcentral, cingulate, insular, left middle temporal, and right middle frontal gyri. Distractor stimuli evoked an fMRI signal change bilaterally in inferior anterior cingulate, medial frontal, inferior frontal, and right superior frontal gyri, with additional activity in bilateral inferior parietal lobules, lateral cerebellar hemispheres and vermis, and left fusiform, middle occipital, and superior temporal gyri. Significant variation in the amplitude and polarity of distractor-evoked activity was observed across stimulus repetitions. No overlap was observed between target- and distractor-evoked activity. These event-related fMRI results shed light on the anatomy of responses to target and distractor stimuli that have proven useful in many ERP studies of healthy and clinically impaired populations."

Studies were performed in the Rhesus monkey during tasks which required saccadic eye movements to remembered target locations in the dark. Neurons were found which remained active during the time period for which the monkey had to withhold eye movements while remembering desired target locations. The activity of the cells was tuned for eye movements of specific direction and amplitude, and it was not necessary for a visual stimulus to fall within the response field. The responses appeared to represent a memory-related motor-planning signal encoding motor error. The relation of the activity to the behavior of the animal suggests that the response represents the intent to make eye movements of specific direction and amplitude."

                "text": "Regional blood oxygenation in the cerebellum and posterior cerebral cortices was monitored with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at four Tesla while 16 normal subjects performed three tasks with identical visual stimulation: fixation; attention focused upon either stimulus shape or color and sustained during blocks of trials (sustained attention); and rapid, serial shifts in attention between stimulus shape or color within blocks of trials (shifting attention). The stimuli were displayed centrally for 100 ms followed by a central fixation mark for 900 ms. Each stimulus was either a circle or a square displayed in either red or green. Attention shifting required switching between color and shape information after each target detection and occurred on average once every three seconds. Subjects pressed a response key upon detecting the target; reaction time and response accuracy were recorded. Two protocols for T2*-weighted echo-planar imaging were optimized, one with a surface coil for the cerebellum alone and the other with a volume coil for imaging both cerebellum and posterior brain structures (parietal, occipital, and part of temporal cortices). Because fMRI of the cerebellum is particularly susceptible to cardiac and respiratory fluctuations, novel techniques were applied to isolate brain activation signals from physiological noise. Functional activation maps were generated for contrasts of 1) sustained attention to color minus fixation; 2) sustained attention to shape minus fixation; and 3) shifting attention minus sustained attention (to color and shape; i.e., summed across blocks of trials). Consistent with the ease of these tasks, subjects performed with >80% accuracy during both sustained attention and shifting attention. Analysis of variance did not show significant differences in false alarms or true hits across either attentional condition. A subgroup of subjects whose performance data were recorded during ten minutes of continuous practice did not show significant changes over time. Both contrasts between the conditions of sustained attention to color or to shape as compared with the fixation condition showed significant bilateral activation in occipital and inferior temporal regions (Brodmann areas 18, 19, and 37). The anterior medial cerebellum was also significantly activated ipsilateral to the finger used for responding. The principal comparison of interest, the contrast between the condition of shifting attention and the condition of sustained attention produced significant and reproducible activation: lateral cerebellar hemisphere (ansiform lobule: Crus I Anterior and Crus I Posterior; left Crus I Posterior); cerebellar folium; posterior superior parietal lobule (R and L); and cuneus and precuneus (R and L)."

The companion paper demonstrates that neurons in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) are capable of encoding the spatial locations of the salient stimulus in multiple stimulus scenes. The present experiment sought to address how neuronal responses to stimuli appearing in the receptive field are modulated after attention has been drawn to one of multiple stimuli in a visual scene. We recorded from area 7a of the PPC in monkeys trained to do a spatial version of a match-to-sample task. The results show that neuronal responses are greatly suppressed when stimuli appear at previously attended locations. No reduction in responsiveness is observed for locations where stimuli had previously appeared but did not draw attention. These results support the hypothesis that area 7a has a role in redirecting attention to stimuli appearing at novel, unattended locations."

The right hemisphere may play a special part in human attention4; neglect, an important phenomenon associated with damage to attentional systems, is more severe, extensive and long-lasting after lesions to the right hemisphere. Here we use PET measurements of brain blood flow in healthy subjects to identify changes in regional brain activity during simple visual and somatosensory tasks of sustained attention or vigilance. We find localized increases in blood flow in the prefrontal and superior parietal cortex primarily in the right hemisphere, regardless of the modality or laterality of sensory input. The anterior cingulate was not activated during either task. These data localize the vigilance aspects of normal human attention to sensory stimuli, thereby clarifying the biology underlying asymmetries of attention to such stimuli that have been reported in clinical lesions."

                "text": "In human vision, two features of the same object can be identified concurrently without loss of accuracy. Performance declines, however, when the features belong to different objects in opposite visual fields. We hypothesized that different positron emission tomography activation patterns would reflect these behavioral results. We first delineated an attention network for single discriminations in left or right visual field and then compared this with the activation pattern when subjects divided attention over two features of a single object or over two objects in opposite hemifields. When subjects attended to a single feature, parietal, premotor, and anterior cingulate cortex were activated. These effects were strongest in the right hemisphere and were, remarkably, unaffected by the direction of attention. In contrast, direction of attention affected occipital and frontal activity: right occipital and left lateral frontal activity were higher with attention to the left, whereas right lateral frontal activity was higher with attention to the right. When subjects identified two features of the same object, parietal, premotor, and anterior cingulate activity was enhanced further, predominantly this time in the left hemisphere. Again, there was no direction sensitivity. Direction-sensitive activation of lateral frontal cortex also was increased. Finally, when subjects divided their attention over opposite hemifields, activity in the direction-sensitive occipital and frontal regions fell to a level midway between those seen during exclusively leftward or rightward attention. Thus, the behavioral efficiency with which we attend to multiple features of a single peripheral object is paralleled by enhanced activity in structures generally active during peripheral selective attention as well as in structures that depend on the specific direction of attention, most notably lateral frontal cortex. In addition, in the direction-sensitive regions, dividing attention over hemifields causes a compromise pattern between the extreme levels obtained during unilateral attention."

On successful trials, neurons in the frontal eye field not only discriminated the target from distractors, but also discriminated distractors that shared a target feature as well as distractors that had been the search target during the previous session. Likewise, occasional errant saccades tended to direct gaze to distractors that either resembled the current target or had been the previous target. These findings show that the frontal eye field is involved in visual and not just motor selection and that visual selection is influenced by long-term priming. The data support the hypothesis that visual selection can be accomplished by parallel processing of objects based on their elementary features."

Visual working memory tasks, in which subjects retain the memory of a stimulus over brief delays, require both the perceptual encoding of the stimulus and the subsequent maintenance of its representation after the stimulus is removed from view. Such tasks activate multiple areas in visual and prefrontal cortices1\u20139. To delineate the roles these areas play in perception and working memory maintenance, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to obtain dynamic measures of neural activity related to different components of a face working memory task\u2014non-selective transient responses to visual stimuli, selective transient responses to faces, and sustained responses over memory delays. Three occipitotemporal areas in the ventral object vision pathway had mostly transient responses to stimuli, indicating their predominant role in perceptual processing, whereas three prefrontal areas demonstrated sustained activity over memory delays, indicating their predominant role in working memory. This distinction, however, was not absolute. Additionally, the visual areas demonstrated different degrees of selectivity, and the prefrontal areas demonstrated different strengths of sustained activity, revealing a continuum of functional specialization, from occipital through multiple prefrontal areas, regarding each area's relative contribution to perceptual and mnemonic processing."

Psychophysical evidence indicated that stimuli at validly cued locations were responded to faster than stimuli at invalidly cued locations. Reaction times to invalid probes were faster when they were presented in the same than in the opposite direction of an ongoing attention movement. PET evidence indicated that superior parietal and superior frontal cortex were more active when attention was shifted to peripheral locations than when maintained at the center of gaze. Both regions encoded the visual field and not the direction of an attention shift. In the right superior parietal lobe, two distinct responses were localized for attention to left and right visual field. Finally, the superior parietal region was active when peripheral locations were selected on the basis of cognitive or sensory cues independent of the execution of an overt response. The frontal region was active only when responses were made to stimuli at selected peripheral locations. These findings indicate that parietal and frontal regions control different aspects of spatial selection. The functional asymmetry in superior parietal cortex may be relevant for the pathophysiology of unilateral neglect."

One influential hypothesis proposes that it subserves spatial perception, whereas other accounts suggest that its primary role is to direct spatial movement,. For humans, it has been suggested that these functions may be divided between inferior and superior parietal lobes, respectively,. In apparent support of a purely perceptual function for the inferior parietal lobe (IPL), patients with lesions to this structure, particularly in the right hemisphere, exhibit unilateral spatial neglect (deficient awareness for the side of space opposite to that of their lesion). Here we show that patients with right IPL lesions also have a specific difficulty in initiating leftward movements towards visual targets on the left side of space. This motor impairment was not found in neglect patients with frontal lesions, contrary to previous proposals that motor aspects of neglect are particularly associated with anterior damage. Our results suggest that the human IPL operates as a sensorimotor interface, rather than subserving only perceptual functions."

A centrally located cue directed attention to one of several stimulus positions in preparation for the identification of a target letter embedded in an array of distractor letters. In all experiments, one stimulus (either the target or one of the distractors) had an abrupt onset; the remaining letters did not. The effectiveness of the cue was manipulated (varying either its duration or its predictive validity) to test whether abrupt onsets capture attention even when subjects are in a highly focused attentional state. Results showed that onsets do not necessarily capture attention in violation of an observer's intentions. A mechanism for partially automatic attentional capture by abrupt onset is proposed, and the diagnosticity of the intentionality criterion for automaticity is discussed."

                "text": "We investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) the neural processes associated with performance of a change-detection task. In this task, two versions of the same picture are presented in alternation, separated by a brief mask interval. Even when the two pictures greatly differ (e.g., as when a building is in different locations), subjects report that identification of the change is difficult and often take 30 or more seconds to identify the change. This phenomenon of change blindness provides a powerful and novel paradigm for segregating components of visual attention using fMRI that can otherwise be confounded in short-duration tasks. By using a response-contingent event-related analysis technique, we successfully dissociated brain regions associated with different processing components of a visual change-detection task. Activation in the calcarine cortex was associated with task onset, but did not vary with the duration of visual search. In contrast, the pattern of activation in dorsal and ventral visual areas was temporally associated with the duration of visual search. As such, our results support a distinction between brain regions whose activation is modulated by attentional demands of the visual task (extrastriate cortex) and those that are not affected by it (primary visual cortex). A second network of areas including central sulcus, insular, and inferior frontal cortical areas, along with the thalamus and basal ganglia, showed phasic activation tied to the execution of responses. Finally, parietal and frontal regions showed systematic deactivations during task performance, consistent with previous reports that these regions may be associated with nontask semantic processing. We conclude that detection of change, when transient visual cues are not present, requires activation of extrastriate visual regions and frontal regions responsible for eye movements. These results suggest that studies of change blindness can inform understanding of more general attentional processing."

The primate posterior parietal cortex contains neurons that are active during visual guidance tasks: in some cases, even if the visual target disappears transiently1,2. It has been proposed that activity of this sort could be related to current or planned eye movements1,2, but it might also provide a more generalized abstract representation of the spatial disposition of targets, even when they are not visible. We have recorded from monkey posterior parietal cortex while the animal viewed a visual stimulus that disappeared, and then, depending on experimental context, could be inferred to be either moving or stationary. During this temporary absence of the stimulus, about half of the neurons were found to be significantly more active on those trials in which the stimulus could be presumed to be moving rather than stationary. The activity was thus present in the absence of either sensory input or motor output, suggesting that it may indeed constitute a generalized representation of target motion."

In Experiment 1, subjects saw a stationary cue that either indicated the direction of motion of a subsequent test stimulus (directional cue) or provided no directional information (neutral cue). Their task was to detect the presence of coherent motion in the test stimulus. The stationary directional cue produced larger modulations than the neutral cue, with respect to a passive viewing baseline, both in motion-sensitive areas such as left MT+ and the anterior intraparietal sulcus, as well as motion-insensitive areas such as the posterior intraparietal sulcus and the junction of the left medial precentral sulcus and superior frontal sulcus. Experiment 2 used an event-related fMRI technique to separate signals during the cue period, in which the expectation was encoded and maintained, from signals during the subsequent test period, in which the expectation was applied to the test object. Cue period activations from a stationary, directional cue included many of the same motion-sensitive and -insensitive areas from Experiment 1 that produced directionally specific modulations. Prefrontal activations were not observed during the cue period, even though the stationary cue information had to be translated into a format appropriate for influencing motion detection, and this format was maintained for the duration of the cue period (\u223c5 sec)."

This investigation dissociates functions of cortical acetylcholine (ACh) and noradrenaline (NA) in arousal and visual attention by simultaneously measuring ACh and NA efflux in the rat prefrontal cortex during sustained attentional performance. The five-choice serial reaction time task was used to provide a continuous assessment of visuospatial attention. Previous studies using this task have established a critical role for the cortical cholinergic system in the detection of visual targets. However, selective lesions of the locus coeruleus noradrenergic system impair performance only when additional attentional demands are placed on the subject by distractors or temporally unpredictable targets. To test the hypothesis that the cortical noradrenergic system is particularly sensitive to novel task contingencies, we also assessed NA and ACh efflux in rats that been trained previously on the task but for whom the instrumental contingency coupling responding with stimulus detection and reward was abolished. Cortical ACh efflux showed a robust and task-related increase during established contingent performance. This response was significantly attenuated in noncontingent subjects, although it still exceeded pretask values. In contrast, NA efflux only increased transiently in contingent subjects after task onset but showed sustained elevations in noncontingent subjects on the first day when contingencies were changed. These data also implicate cortical ACh in aspects of attentional functioning but highlight a specific involvement of the cortical noradrenergic system in detecting shifts in the predictive relationship between instrumental action and reinforcement."

Peripheral and central cues are believed to activate different reflexive and voluntary modes of orienting (Jonides, 1981; Posner, 1980). Experiment 1 showed that the time courses of facilitation and inhibition from peripheral and central cues were characteristic and different. Experiment 2 showed that voluntary orienting in response to symbolic central cues is interrupted by reflexive orienting to random peripheral flashes. Experiment 3 showed that irrelevant peripheral flashes also compete with relevant peripheral cues. The amount of interference varied systematically with the interval between the onset of the relevant cue and of the distracting flash (cue-flash onset asynchrony) and with the cuing condition.

                "text": "Detection of a visual signal requires information to reach a system capable of eliciting arbitrary responses required by the experimenter. Detection latencies are reduced when subjects receive a cue that indicates where in the visual field the signal will occur. This shift in efficiency appears to be due to an alignment (orienting) of the central attentional system with the pathways to be activated by the visual input. It would also be possible to describe these results as being due to a reduced criterion at the expected target position. However, this description ignores important constraints about the way in which expectancy improves performance. First, when subjects are cued on each trial, they show stronger expectancy effects than when a probable position is held constant for a block, indicating the active nature of the expectancy. Second, while information on spatial position improves performance, information on the form of the stimulus does not. Third, expectancy may lead to improvements in latency without a reduction in accuracy. Fourth, there appears to be little ability to lower the criterion at two positions that are not spatially contiguous. A framework involving the employment of a limited-capacity attentional mechanism seems to capture these constraints better than the more general language of criterion setting. Using this framework, we find that attention shifts are not closely related to the saccadic eye movement system. For luminance detection the retina appears to be equipotential with respect to attention shifts, since costs to unexpected stimuli are similar whether foveal or peripheral. These results appear to provide an important model system for the study of the relationship between attention and the structure of the visual system."

                "text": "1. Single-neuron activity was recorded from the prefrontal cortex of monkeys performing saccadic eye movements in oculomotor delayed-response (ODR) and visually guided saccade (VGS) tasks. In the ODR task the monkey was required to maintain fixation of a central spot throughout the 0.5-s cue and 3.0-s delay before making a saccadic eye movement in the dark to one of four or eight locations where the visual cue had been presented. The same locations were used for targets in the VGS tasks; however, unlike the ODR task, saccades in the VGS tasks were visually guided. 2. Among 434 neurons recorded from prefrontal cortex within and surrounding the principal sulcus (PS), 147 changed their discharge rates in relation to saccadic eye movements in the ODR task. Their response latencies relative to saccade initiation were distributed between -192 and 460-ms, with 22% exhibiting presaccadic activity and 78% exhibiting only postsaccadic activity. Among PS neurons with presaccadic activity, 53% also had postsaccadic activity when the monkey made saccadic eye movements opposite to the directions for which the presaccadic activity was observed. 3. Almost all (97%) PS neurons with presaccadic activity were directionally selective. The best direction and tuning specificity of each neuron were estimated from parameters used to fit a Gaussian tuning curve function. The best direction for 62% of the neurons with presaccadic activity was toward the contralateral visual field, with the remaining neurons having best directions toward the ipsilateral field (23%) or along the vertical meridian (15%). 4. Most postsaccadic activity of PS neurons (92%) was also directionally selective. The best direction for 48% of these neurons was toward the contralateral visual field, with the remaining neurons having best directions toward the ipsilateral field (36%) or along the vertical meridian (16%). Eighteen percent of the neurons with postsaccadic activity showed a reciprocal response pattern: excitatory responses occurred for one set of saccade directions, whereas inhibitory responses occurred for roughly the opposite set of directions. 5. Sixty PS neurons with saccade-related activity in the ODR task were also examined in a VGS task. Forty of these neurons showed highly similar profiles of directional specificity and response magnitude in both tasks, 13 showed saccade-related activity only in the ODR task, and 7 changed their response characteristics between the ODR and VGS tasks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Consistent with the results from a recent erfMRI study in the visual modality, target processing was associated with activation bilaterally in the anterior superior temporal gyrus, inferior and middle frontal gyrus, inferior and superior parietal lobules, anterior and posterior cingulate, thalamus, caudate, and the amygdala/hippocampal complex. Analyses of the novel stimuli revealed activation bilaterally in the inferior frontal gyrus, insula, inferior parietal lobule, and in the inferior, middle, and superior temporal gyri. These data suggest that the scalp recorded event-related potentials (e.g., N2 and P3) elicited during similar tasks reflect an ensemble of neural generators located in spatially remote cortical areas."

However, in monkeys, this disorder is observed after lesions of the superior temporal cortex, a puzzling discrepancy between the species. Here we show that, contrary to the widely accepted view, the superior temporal cortex is the neural substrate of spatial neglect in humans, as it is in monkeys. Unlike the monkey brain, spatial awareness in humans is a function largely confined to the right superior temporal cortex, a location topographically reminiscent of that for language on the left. Hence, the decisive phylogenetic transition from monkey to human brain seems to be a restriction of a formerly bilateral function to the right side, rather than a shift from the temporal to the parietal lobe. One may speculate that this lateralization of spatial awareness parallels the emergence of an elaborate representation for language on the left side."

Subjects detected a brief interval of coherent motion embedded in dynamic noise that was presented throughout a test period. Several brain regions, including V1/V2, middle temporal complex (MT+), left intraparietal cortex, and the frontal eye field, were activated at the onset of the dynamic noise, irrespective of whether a coherent motion target was presented early or late in the test period, or not at all. These regions, many of which were motion sensitive, were likely involved in searching for and detecting the target. The blood oxygenation level-dependent signal in these regions was higher in trials in which a target was detected than in trials in which it was missed or not presented, indicating that these regions were modulated by detection. Moreover, the blood oxygenation leveldependent signal in these regions decayed quickly once a target was detected, even though the dynamic noise continued to be displayed, indicating that they were shut down after detection. Therefore, detection-related modulations occurred in the same regions that accumulate target information over time, in agreement with current psychological and neural models of detection. Many other regions, however, including areas in prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate, were not involved in searching for a target. In these regions, activation began early in the test period when an early target was detected but began late in the test period when a late target was detected or when a response was correctly withheld in the absence of a motion target. The signal in these regions was therefore triggered by a discrete event during the test interval that was related to presence-absence detection."

                "text": "1. A task was used by Posner (1980) to measure shifts of attention that occurred covertly, in the absence of an eye movement or other orienting response. This paradigm was used here to assess the nature of covert attentional orienting in monkeys to develop an animal model for neurophysiological studies. Shifts of attention were measurable in monkeys and were consistent across a variety of experimental conditions. 2. The paradigm required that monkeys fixate and release a bar at the appearance of a target, which was preceded by a cue. Reaction times to targets that followed peripheral cues at the same location (validly cued) were significantly faster than those that followed cues in the opposite visual field (invalidly cued). This difference was defined as the validity effect, which as in humans, is used as the measure of a covert attentional shift. 3. When the proportion of validly to invalidly cued targets was decreased, no change was seen in the validity effect of the monkeys. This is in contrast to humans, for whom the ratio of validly to invalidly cued targets affected the magnitude of the validity effect. When 80% of the targets were preceded by cues at the same location, the validity effect was greatest. The effect was reversed when the proportions were reversed. From this result, it is concluded that cognitive processes can affect covert orienting to peripheral cues in humans, whereas in trained monkeys, performance was automatic. 4. To test whether cognitive influences on attention could be demonstrated in the monkey, an animal was taught to use symbolic, foveal signals to covertly direct attention. The magnitude of this validity effect was greater than that obtained with peripheral cues. 5. The effects of motivational and perceptual processes were tested. Although overall reaction times could be modified, the facilitating effects of the cues persisted. This constancy across motivational and perceptual levels supports the notion that the monkeys were performing the task in an automatic way, under the exogenous control of peripheral cues. 6. Most visual cuing has been tested with visual landmarks at the locations of cues and targets. These monkeys were trained with such landmarks, and when tested without them, the attentional effect of the cues was nearly abolished. These data suggest that local visual features can be important for covert orienting. 7. To determine the spatial extent of the effect of the cue, monkeys and humans were tested with four cue-target distances (0-60 degrees).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

The eye movements made by monkeys after correct no-go trials, in addition to an attenuation of the visual responses in no-go trials compared with go trials, indicated that covert saccade planning was effectively discouraged. During no-go search trials, the activity of the majority of neurons evolved to signal the location of the oddball stimulus. The degree and time course of the stimulus discrimination process observed in no-go trials was not different from that observed in go trials. We conclude that the discrimination of a salient visual stimulus reflected by FEF neurons is not contingent on saccade production but rather may reflect the outcome of an automatic visual selection process."

All patients with right hemisphere lesions showed a greater impairment in both the speed of response and the detection rate in the contralesional than in the ipsilesional hemifield. This interfield difference increased with the eccentricity of stimulus presentation and was especially pronounced in neglect patients who showed a paradoxical increase in speed of response and detection rate at increasingly larger eccentricities in the ipsilesional hemifield. We hypothesize that both the contralesional slowing down and the ipsilesional speeding up of the response depends upon an exaggerated gradient of attention towards the ipsilesional hemifield. To assess whether these abnormalities concern automatic or controlled attentional processes, in a second experiment, we manipulated the predictability of the side of the stimulus presentation by using blocked rather than randomized stimulus presentations. This resulted in a speeding up of responses in both hemifields thus showing that the patients were able to focus attention to the side of stimulus presentation voluntarily. However, there was no modification of the contra-ipsilesional differences which, therefore, are likely to be related to abnormal automatic processes rather than controlled attention."

This is said to reflect a reflexive shift of attention towards the source of stimulation. After attention is removed from such a peripheral location, there is then delayed responding to stimuli subsequently displayed there. This inhibitory aftereffect, first described in 1984 and later labeled 'inhibition of return (IOR)', encourages orienting towards novel locations and hence might facilitate foraging and other search behaviors. Since its relatively recent discovery, IOR has been the subject of intensive investigation, from many angles and with a wide variety of approaches. After describing the seminal contribution of Posner and Cohen ('Who'), this review will discuss what causes IOR and, once initiated, what effects IOR has on subsequent processing ('What'). The time course ('When') and spatial distribution ('Where') of IOR, and what is known about IOR's neural implementation ('How') and functional significance ('Why') are also discussed."

                "text": "Attention can be used to keep track of moving items, particularly when there are multiple targets of interest that cannot all be followed with eye movements. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate cortical regions involved in attentive tracking. Cortical flattening techniques facilitated within-subject comparisons of activation produced by attentive tracking, visual motion, discrete attention shifts, and eye movements. In the main task, subjects viewed a display of nine green \"bouncing balls\" and used attention to mentally track a subset of them while fixating. At the start of each attentive-tracking condition, several target balls (e.g., 3/9) turned red for 2 s and then reverted to green. Subjects then used attention to keep track of the previously indicated targets, which were otherwise indistinguishable from the nontargets. Attentive-tracking conditions alternated with passive viewing of the same display when no targets had been indicated. Subjects were pretested with an eye-movement monitor to ensure they could perform the task accurately while fixating. For seven subjects, functional activation was superimposed on each individual's cortically unfolded surface. Comparisons between attentive tracking and passive viewing revealed bilateral activation in parietal cortex (intraparietal sulcus, postcentral sulcus, superior parietal lobule, and precuneus), frontal cortex (frontal eye fields and precentral sulcus), and the MT complex (including motion-selective areas MT and MST). Attentional enhancement was absent in early visual areas and weak in the MT complex. However, in parietal and frontal areas, the signal change produced by the moving stimuli was more than doubled when items were tracked attentively. Comparisons between attentive tracking and attention shifting revealed essentially identical activation patterns that differed only in the magnitude of activation. This suggests that parietal cortex is involved not only in discrete shifts of attention between objects at different spatial locations but also in continuous \"attentional pursuit\" of moving objects. Attentive-tracking activation patterns were also similar, though not identical, to those produced by eye movements. Taken together, these results suggest that attentive tracking is mediated by a network of areas that includes parietal and frontal regions responsible for attention shifts and eye movements and the MT complex, thought to be responsible for motion perception. These results are consistent with theoretical models of attentive tracking as an attentional process that assigns spatial tags to targets and registers changes in their position, generating a high-level percept of apparent motion."

Ten healthy subjects were asked to learn the positions of seven circular targets that were repeatedly projected on a screen. The regional cerebral blood flow was measured with positron emission tomography during a rest state, at an early learning stage, at a later learning stage, and finally at 30 min after the course of learning had been completed. Mean rCBF change images for each task minus rest were calculated and fields of significant rCBF changes were identified. In all three task states, cortical fields were consistently activated in the left motor and premotor areas, the posterior part of the superior parietal lobule, and the right angular gyrus. When learning of the target positions had been achieved, additional fields appeared bilaterally in the posterior part of the superior parietal lobule, the right superior occipital gyrus, the left motor and premotor areas, the medial aspect of the superior frontal gyrus, the postcentral gyrus, the superior part of the cuneus, the inferior part of the angular gyrus, and the anterior part of the insula.

In a typical experiment, before the arrays were presented, subjects would be asked to report letters appearing in one color (targets, here black letters), and to disregard letters in the other color (nontargets, here white letters). The array would then be briefly flashed, and the subjects, without any opportunity for eye movements, would give their report. The display mimics our. usual cluttered visual environment: It contains one or more objects that are relevant to current behavior, along with others that are irrelevant. The first basic phenomenon is limited capacity for processing information. At any given time, only a small amount of the information available on the retina can be processed and used in the control of behavior. Subjectively, giving attention to any one target leaves less available for others. In Figure 1, the probability of reporting the target letter N is much lower with two accompa\u00ad nying targets (Figure la) than with none (Figure Ib). The second basic phenomenon is selectivity-the ability to filter out un\u00ad wanted information. Subjectively, one is aware of attended stimuli and largely unaware of unattended ones. Correspondingly, accuracy in identifying an attended stimulus may be independent of the number of nontargets in a display (Figure la vs Ie) (see Bundesen 1990, Duncan 1980)."

In a variant of the spatial cuing paradigm, the relation between cue property and the property useful in locating the target was systematically manipulated. In Experiment 1, invalid abrupt-onset precues produced costs for targets characterized by an abrupt onset but not for targets characterized by a discontinuity in color. In Experiment 2, invalid color precues produced greater costs for color targets than for abrupt-onset targets. Experiment 3 provided converging evidence for this pattern. Experiment 4 investigated the boundary conditions and time course for attention shifts elicited by color discontinuities. The results of these experiments suggest that attention capture is contingent on attentional control settings induced by task demands."

Exemplars of three stimulus categories were presented at a rate of one per 1.5 sec for 10 runs, each consisting of 132 trials. Standards were color squares of varying sizes that were presented on \u223c92% of trials. Targets were color circles of varying sizes presented irregularly on \u223c4% of trials. Novels were pictures of everyday objects that were also presented irregularly on \u223c4% of trials. Ten subjects participated in two separate sessions in which they were required to count mentally or to push a button whenever a target appeared. Targets evoked activation within prefrontal cortex, primarily within the middle frontal gyri (MFG). This MFG activation did not differ as a function of the required response. Novels did not evoke significant activity within this region despite evidence from a separate behavioral and event-related potential study demonstrating their strong influence on processing. In additional imaging sessions with two subjects, the rules were reversed to require a button press whenever an object, but not a circle, appeared. These former novels now evoked activation in the MFG, but the former target circles did not. These experiments indicate that MFG activation is reliably evoked by exemplars from arbitrary stimulus categories that are mapped by experimental rules onto an arbitrary covert or overt response."

This ability to performvisual search has been the subject of a large body of research in the past 15 years. This paper reviews the visual search literature and presents a model of human search behavior. Built upon the work of Neisser, Treisman, Julesz, and others, the model distinguishes between a preattentive, massively parallel stage that processes information about basic visual features (color, motion, various depth cues, etc.) across large portions of the visual field and a subsequent limited-capacity stage that performs other, more complex operations (e.g., face recognition, reading, object identification) over a limited portion of the visual field. The spatial deployment of the limited-capacity process is under attentional control. The heart of the guided search model is the idea that attentional deployment of limited resources isguided by the output of the earlier parallel processes. Guided Search 2.0 (GS2) is a revision of the model in which virtually all aspects of the model have been made more explicit and/or revised in light of new data. The paper is organized into four parts: Part 1 presents the model and the details of its computer simulation. Part 2 reviews the visual search literature on preattentive processing of basic features and shows how the GS2 simulation reproduces those results. Part 3 reviews the literature on the attentional deployment of limited-capacity processes in conjunction and serial searches and shows how the simulation handles those conditions. Finally, Part 4 deals with shortcomings of the model and unresolved issues."

                "text": "Patients with extensive damage to the right hemisphere of their brain often exhibit unilateral neglect of the left side of space. The spatial attention of these patients is strongly biased towards the right, so their awareness of visual events on the left is impaired. Extensive right-hemisphere lesions also impair tonic alertness (the ability to maintain arousal). This nonspatial deficit in alertness is often considered to be a different problem from spatial neglect,, but the two impairments may be linked,. If so, then phasically increasing the patients' alertness should temporarily ameliorate their spatial bias in awareness. Here we provide evidence to support this theory. Right-hemisphere-neglect patients judged whether a visual event on the left preceded or followed a comparable event on the right. They became aware of left events half a second later than right events on average. This spatial imbalance in the time course of visual awareness was corrected when a warning sound alerted the patients phasically. Even a warning sound on the right accelerated the perception of left visual events in this way. Nonspatial phasic alerting can thus overcome disabling spatial biases in perceptual awareness after brain injury."

Execution of both saccadic and pursuit eye movements induced bilateral FEF activation located medially at the junction of the precentral sulcus and the superior frontal sulcus and extending laterally to the precentral gyrus. These findings extend previous functional imaging studies by providing the first functional imaging evidence of a specific activation in the FEF during smooth pursuit eye movements in healthy humans. FEF activation during smooth pursuit performance was smaller than during saccades. This finding, which may reflect the presence of a smaller pursuit-related region area in human FEF than the saccade-related region, is consistent with their relative size observed in the monkey. The mean location of the pursuit-related FEF was more inferior and lateral than the location of the saccade-related FEF. These results provide the first evidence that there are different subregions in the human FEF that are involved in the execution of two different types of eye movements, namely saccadic and pursuit eye movements. Moreover, this study provides additional evidence that the human FEF is located in Brodmann's area 6, unlike the monkey FEF which is located in the posterior part of Brodmann's area 8."

Results support neither a distinction between serial and parallel search nor between search for features and conjunctions. For all search materials, instead, difficulty increases with increased similarity of targets to nontargets and decreasedsimilarity between nontargets, producing a continuum of search efficiency. A parallel stage of perceptual grouping and description is followed by competitive interaction between inputs, guiding selective access to awareness and action. An input gains weight to the extent that it matches an internal description of that information needed in current behavior (hence the effect of targetnontarget similarity). Perceptual grouping encourages input weights to change together (allowing \"spreading suppression\" of similar nontargets). The theory accounts for harmful effects of nontargets resembling any possible target, the importance of local nontarget grouping, and many other findings."

Saccade latencies were measured in a task in which subjects were provided partial advance information about the spatial location of a target fixation. In one experiment, subjects were faster in initiating saccades when they knew either the direction or amplitude of the required movement in advance compared to a condition with equal uncertainty about the number of potential saccade targets but without knowledge of the parameters required to execute the movement. These results suggest that the direction and amplitude for an upcoming saccade were calculated separately, and not in a fixed serial order. In another experiment, subjects appear to have programmed the saccades more holistically--with computations of direction and amplitude parameters occurring simultaneously. The implications of these results for models of eye movement preparation are discussed."

Change detection resulted in enhanced activity in the parietal and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as well as category-selective regions of the extrastriate visual cortex (for example, fusiform gyrus for changing faces). Although change blindness resulted in some extrastriate activity, the dorsal activations were clearly absent. These results demonstrate the importance of parietal and dorsolateral frontal activations for conscious detection of changes in properties coded in the ventral visual pathway, and thus suggest a key involvement of dorsal\u2013ventral interactions in visual awareness."

She responded with a lever movement in one direction if a given letter designated by a bar indicator was a member of the set A-U and in the opposite direction if it was from the other set. The principal experimental variables were the SOA by which the indicator preceded the display and whether the target letter was flanked by letters of the same or opposite set. The results indicated that the interference produced by noise letters is primarily on the response as opposed to the processing side. Also, there is a limit to the precision of selective attention in the visual field. The interference of opposite-set letters was inversely proportional to their distance from the target."

Lesion location was assessed using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The common area of lesion overlap was small, being confined to the dorsal aspect of the inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann's area 44) and the immediate underlying white matter. This cortical region is part of the homologue of Broca's area in the right hemisphere and is considered to be part of human premotor cortex. The association of neglect with injury to this area suggests it may play an important role in directing attention in visual space."

Task-switching cost dissipated passively while the participants waited for the instructional cue in order to know which task to execute (during the Response-Cue Interval). Switching cost was sharply reduced, but not abolished, when the participants actively prepared for the task switch in response to the instructional cue (during the Cue-Target Interval). The preparation for a task switch has shown not to be a by-product of general preparation by phasic alertness or predicting target onset. It is suggested that task-switching cost has at least three components reflecting (1) the passive dissipation of the previous task set, (2) the preparation of the new task set, and (3) a residual component."

                "text": "We studied the activity of single neurons in the frontal eye fields of awake macaque monkeys trained to perform several oculomotor tasks. Fifty-four percent of neurons discharged before visually guided saccades. Three different types of presaccadic activity were observed: visual, movement, and anticipatory. Visual activity occurred in response to visual stimuli whether or not the monkey made saccades. Movement activity preceded purposive saccades, even those made without visual targets. Anticipatory activity preceded even the cue to make a saccade if the monkey could reliably predict what saccade he had to make. These three different activities were found in different presaccadic cells in different proportions. Forty percent of presaccadic cells had visual activity (visual cells) but no movement activity. For about half of the visual cells the response was enhanced if the monkey made saccades to the receptive-field stimulus, but there was no discharge before similar saccades made without visual targets. Twenty percent of presaccadic neurons discharged as briskly before purposive saccades made without a visual target as they did before visually guided saccades, and had weak or absent visual responses. These cells were defined as movement cells. Movement cells discharged much less or not at all before saccades made spontaneously without a task requirement or an overt visual target. The remaining presaccadic neurons (40%) had both visual and movement activity (visuomovement cells). They discharged most briskly before visually guided eye movements, but also discharged before purposive eye movements made in darkness and responded to visual stimuli in the absence of saccades. There was a continuum of visuomovement cells, from cells in which visual activity predominated to cells in which movement activity predominated. This continuum suggests that although visual cells are quite distinct from movement cells, the division of cell types into three classes may be only a heuristic means of describing the processing flow from visual input to eye-movement output. Twenty percent of visuomovement and movement cells, but fewer than 2% of visual cells, had anticipatory activity. Only one cell had anticipatory activity as its sole response. When the saccade was delayed relative to the target onset, visual cells responded to the target appearance, movement cells discharged before the saccade, and visuomovement cells discharged in different ways during the delay, usually with some discharge following the target and an increase in rate immediately before the saccade. Presaccadic neurons of all types were actively suppressed following a saccade into their response fields.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Support for this comes from studies in which subjects searched for a target that shared a single feature with each of two different kinds of distractor items (e.g., a red O in a field of black Os and red Ns). Reaction time increased linearly with display size. We argue that this design may obscure evidence of selectivity in search. In an experiment in which the numbers of the two distractors were unconfounded, we find evidence that subjects can search through specified subsets of stimuli. For example, subjects told to search through just the Os to find the red O target do so without searching through Ns. Implications of selective search are discussed."

                "text": "A model is proposed to account for the loss in visibility of moving targets that occurs when an observer is uncertain about the target's direction of motion. The model's key features are an array of directionally selective visual mechanisms and a rule governing the mechanisms from which an observer will derive sensory data. In response to uncertainty about two possible directions of motion, the observer is assumed to use a mechanism whose peak sensitivity is to a direction midway between the two possible directions. Seven experiments, using both reaction time and forced-choice data, demonstrate the predictive advantages of this midway model over competing single-band and multiple-band models. Additionally, the experiments reveal several new properties of human motion perception: (a) Direction and velocity information have orthogonal representations in the visual system; (b) although motion sensitivity does not vary with direction, the precision with which small changes in direction can be recognized does, reflecting differential breadth of tuning for directionally selective mechanisms sensitive to various directions; and (c) motion-analyzing mechanisms are broadly tuned for direction as well as speed. Human psychophysics provides extensive evidence for the existence of visual mechanisms tuned to different directions of motion. Converging on this point are data from a variety of paradigms including selective adaptation (Sekuler & Ganz, 1963), subthreshold summation (Levinson & Sekuler, 1975), and aftereffects (Keck, Palella, & Pantle, 1976). In addition, we recently used a masking procedure to define the direction sensitivity profiles of these mechanisms (Ball & Sekuler, 1979). In general, these studies tell us how much information is potentially available in motion-sensit ive visual elements under ideal conditions. But they tell us little about the use to which that information can be put under nonideal conditions outside the laboratory."

The tasks were to classify either the digit member of a pair of characters as even/odd or the letter member as consonant/vowel. As the response-stimulus interval increased up to 0.6 s, the substantial cost to performance of this predictable task-switch fell: Participants could partially reconfigure in advance of the stimulus. However, even with 1.2 s available for preparation, a large asymptotic reaction time (RT) cost remained, but only on the 1st trial of the new task. This is attributed to a component of reconfiguration triggered exogenously, i. e., only by a task-relevant stimulus. That stimuli evoke associated task-sets also explains why RT and switch costs increased when the stimulus included a character associated with the currently irrelevant task. \u00a9 1995 American Psychological Association."

A total of 57 patients were randomly assigned to experimental (N=25) or control (N=32) groups. All patients were administered the same test battery prior to assignment. Experimentals received the specific training program and the controls received standard rehabilitation. Both groups were retested after a period of one month. Analysis revealed the superior performance of the experimental group. The results suggest that the academic disorders found in right brain damage can be treated as secondary to a primary disturbance in visual scanning behavior."

When observers tried to remember multiple directions of motion, performance deteriorated with increasing number of directions. Still, memory for multiple directions was unchanged over delays of up to 30 s. In a forced-choice experiment, observers viewed 2 successive animation sequences separated by a memory interval; for both sequences, dots moved in any direction within a limited bandwidth. Observers accurately judged which animation sequence was more coherent, even with memory intervals of 30 s.

In a third he deals with \u201cmorbid forms of attention.\u201d These, with a short introduction and a short conclusion, constitute the compact little work. Although there is not very much that is, strictly speaking, new\u2014and is this to be expected?\u2014there is scarcely a page without some apt illustration, some pithy epigram, or some well-expressed generalization.

In experiments using this movement precuing technique, information is given about some, none, or all of the defining values of a movement that will be required when a reaction signal is presented. It is assumed that the reaction time (RT) reflects the time to specify those values that were not precued. With RTs for the same movements in different precue conditions, it is possible to make detailed inferences about the value specification process for each of the movements under study. The present experiments were concerned with the specification of the arm, direction, and extent (or distance) of aimed hand movements. In Experiment 1 it appeared that (a) specification times during RTs were longest for arm, shorter for direction, and shortest for extent, and (b) these values were specified serially but not in an invariant order. Experiment 2 suggested that the precuing effects obtained in Experiment 1 were not attributable to stimulus identification. Experiment 3 suggested that subjects in Experiment 1 did not use precues to prepare sets of possible movements from which the required movement was later selected. The model of value specification supported by the data is consistant with a distinctive-feature view, rather than a hierarchical view, of motor programming."

Few species differences were observed for either monoamine. Cortical areas 17 and 18, as well as visual areas in the temporal and parietal lobe were found to exhibit regional specialization of both 5\u2010HT and NA innervation. Precisely at the border between areas 17 and 18, the laminar innervation patterns and density characteristic of NA fibers in area 17 (Morrison et al., '82a; Kosofsky et al., '84) shift so that layer IV of area 18 contains more fibers than layer IV of area 17, and the overall density of fibers in area 18 is higher. For 5\u2010HT, the highly laminated patterns characteristic of area 17 (Morrison et al., '82a; Kosofsky et al., '84) also observe this cytoarchitectonic boundary. Fibers in area 18 are more evenly distributed across laminae, and the overall density of fibers decreases. The visual region of the inferotemporal cortex was found to be very lightly innervated by NA fibers and very densely innervated by 5\u2010HT fibers. Area 7 of the parietal lobule was more densely innervated by NA fibers, and less densely innervated by 5\u2010HT fibers, than any other visual cortical region examined."

Our computerized, two-stage flattening method takes as its input any well-defined representation of a surface within the three-dimensional cortex. The first stage rapidly converts this surface to a topologically correct two-dimensional map. without regard for the amount of distortion introduced. The second stage reduces distortions using a multiresolution strategy that makes gross shape changes on a coarsely sampled map and further shape refinements on progressively finer resolution maps. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by creating flat maps of the entire cerebral cortex in the macaque monkey and by displaying various types of experimental data on such maps. We also introduce a surface-based coordinate system that has advantages over conventional stereotaxic coordinates and is relevant to studies of cortical organization in humans as well as non-human primates. Together, these methods provide an improved basis for quantitative studies of individual variability in cortical organization."

The principles underlying the development of the index are similar to those involved in the development of the Motricity Index for hemiplegia. A population of 68 survivors of stroke who presented with visual neglect at two to three days were followed for up to six months. The VNRI showed that neglect was greater in those with right hemisphere stroke than in those with left hemisphere stroke and that recovery was most rapid over the first 10 days and reached a plateau at three months. Most patients, including many with severe initial visual neglect, showed little visual neglect at three months. Stepwise regression analysis showed that the severity of visual neglect at three months and at six months post-stroke could be predicted by the severity of visual neglect and the presence of anosognosia at two to three days. A regression equation was produced which may enable clinicians to select patients for intensive treatment of visual neglect."

Unfortunately that course is not open to us in the present instance. The subject is too vast. We cannot exhibit the grandeur; we can only in a few general phrases express our admiration of the profound, all-embracing philosophy of which the work before us is an instalment. The doctrine of evolution when taken up by Mr. Spencer was little more than a crotchet. He has made it the idea of the age. In its presence other systems of philosophy are hushed, they cease their strife and become its servants, while all the sciences do it homage. The place that the doctrine of evolution has secured in the minds of those who think for the educated public may be indicated by a few names taken just as they occur. Mr. Darwin's works, the novels of George Eliot, Mr. Tylor's \u201c Primitive Culture,\u201d Dr. Bastian's \u201c Beginnings of Life,\u201d and Mr. Bagehot's \u201c Physics and Politics,\u201d have almost nothing in common but the idea of evolution, with which they are all more or less imbued. In a word we have but one other thinker with whom in point of influence on the higher thought of this, and probably of several succeeding generations, Mr. Spencer can be classed:-it does not need saying' that that other is Mr. J, S. Mill.The Principles of Psychology.By Herbert Spencer. Second Edition. (London: Williams and Norgate.)"

One hypothesis maintains that parietal cortex controls the voluntary orienting of attention toward a location of interest. Another hypothesis emphasizes its role in reorienting attention toward visual targets appearing at unattended locations. Here, using event-related functional magnetic resonance (ER-fMRI), we show that distinct parietal regions mediated these different attentional processes. Cortical activation occurred primarily in the intraparietal sulcus when a location was attended before visual-target presentation, but in the right temporoparietal junction when the target was detected, particularly at an unattended location."
