This report describes a direct way of realizing these semantic networks with neuron-like computing units. The proposed framework appears to offer several advantages over previous work. It obviates the need for a centralized knowledge base interpreter, thereby partially solving the problem of computational effectiveness and also embodies an evidential semantics for knowledge that provides a natural treatment of defaults, exceptions and inconsistent or conflicting information. The model employs a class of inference that may be characterized as working with a set of competing hypotheses, gathering evidence for each hypothesis and selecting the best among these. The resulting system has been simulated and is capable of supporting existing semantic network applications dealing with problems of recognition and recall in a uniform manner. (Author)."

The first part of the paper shows that people assign greater impact to causal data than to diagnostic data of equal informativeness. When the same datum has both causal and diagnostic implications, the former dominate the latter. The ease with which people explain unexpected facts and the reluctance to revise old conceptions in the light of new facts are related to the dominance of causal over diagnostic reasoning. The second part of the paper analyzes the use and neglect of base-rate data in terms of the role of these data in causal schemata. It is shown that base-rate information which is given a causal interpretation affects judgments, while base-rate information which cannot be interpreted in this manner is given little or no weight."

The system uses a Bayesian inference procedure which combines causal and diagnostic reasoning using a bidirectional propagation of evidence in the form of belief parameters. Upon completion of the dialogue the system provides a formal structure representing relevant propositions, their interrelations, and their updated belief distributions."

It is a discussion of relations among what might be called the descriptive quantities associated with Markov chains - probabilities of events and means of random variables that give insight into the behaviour of the chains. The approach, by means of infinite matrices, simplifies the notation, shortens statements and proofs of theorems, and often suggests new results. This second edition includes a new chapter, \"Introduction to Random Fields\", written by David Giffeath."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

This report describes a TMS algorithm that is substantially different from previous systems. This algorithm performs deduction in traditional propositional logic in such a way that the premise set from which deduction is being done can be easily manipulated. A novel approach is also taken to the role of a TMS in larger deductive systems. In this approach the TMS performs all propositional deduction in a uniform manner while the larger system is responsible for controlling the instantiation of universally quantified formulae and axiom schemas."

Most current inference systems in artificial intelligence have emphasized intuitive methods, because the absence of adequate statistical samples forces a reliance on the subjective judgment of human experts. We describe in this paper a subjective Bayesian inference method that realizes some of the advantages of both formal and informal approaches. Of particular interest are the modifications needed to deal with the inconsistencies usually found in collections of subjective statements."

The advice is generated by consulting relaxed, easy models which are backtrack-free. \n \nWe identify a subset of CSPs whose syntactic and semantic properties make them easy to solve. The syntactic properties involve the structure of the constraint graph, while the semantic properties guarantee some local consistencies among the constraints. In particular, problems supported by tree-like constraint graphs, and some width-2 graphs, can be easily solved and are therefore chosen as the target model for the relaxation scheme. Optimal algorithms for solving easy problems are presented and analyzed. Finally, an efficient method is introduced for extracting advice from easy problems and using it to speedup the solution of hard problems."

The major conclusions are: 1. The paradigm of viewing problem solving in terms of hypothesize-and-test actions distributed among distinct representations of the problem has been shown to be computationally feasible. 2. A global working memory (the \"blackboard\"), in which the distinct representations are integrated in a uniform manner, has made it convenient to construct and integrate the individual sources of knowledge needed for the problem solution. 3. The use of a uniform data-directed structure for controlling knowledge-source activity has made the system easy to understand and modify. 4. A solution has been demonstrated to the problem of focus-of-attention in this type of control environment. This solution does not need to be modified when the sources of knowledge in the system are changed."

According to the model context aids the perception of target letters as they are processed in the perceptual system. The implication that the duration and timing of the context in which a letter occurs should greatly influence the perceptibility of the target is confirmed by a series of experiments demonstrating that early or enhanced presentations of word and pronounceablepseudoword contexts greatly increase the perceptibility of target letters. Also according to the model, letters in strings that share several letters with words should be equally perceptible whether they are orthographically regular and pronounceable (SLET) or irregular (SLNT) and should be much more perceptible than letters in contexts that share few letters with any word (XLQJ). This prediction is tested and confirmed. The basic results of all the experiments are accounted for, with some modification of parameters, although there are some discrepancies in detail. Several recent findings that seem to challenge the model are considered and a number of extensions are proposed."
