If the positioning of the face in the image is accurate, the need for shifting to obtain the best matching between the unknown subject and a template is drastically reduced, with considerable advantages in computing costs. In this paper, a novel technique is presented based on a very efficient eyes localization algorithm. The technique has been implemented as part of the \u201celectronic librarian\u201d of MAIA, the experimental platform of the integrated Al project under development at IRST. Preliminary experimental results on a set of 220 facial images of 55 people disclose excellent recognition rates and processing speed."

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture."

Three classes of experiments are reported: 1) Gathering, analysis, and assessment of face-feature data for 255 faces. 2) Computer identification-studies. 3) Human identification-studies. A set of 22 features was evolved from an initially larger set to provide relevant, distinctive, relatively independent measures which can be judged reliably. Computer studies and a mathematical model established limits of performance of a person attempting to isolate a face from a population using feature descriptions. The model predicts that under certain conditions approximately 6 of an individual's features are required to isolate him from a population of 255. Human experiments under similar conditions showed unique identification occurred with an average of about 7 features. The model predicts that for a population of 4\u00d7106, only 14 feature-descriptions are required. These studies form a foundation for continuing research on real-time man-machine interaction for computer classification and identification of multidimensional vectors specified by noisy components."

Gray-level images are represented by a resolution hierarchy of local Gabor components, which are all scaled and rotated versions of each other. The components centered on one image point form a Gabor jet. A single jet provides a distortion-insensitive local representation of part of an image. Object recognition is achieved by matching image point jets to jets in stored prototype patterns. For a selected image jet the best matches are determined, under a constraint preserving spatial arrangement. The procedure amounts to labeled graph matching, with Gabor jets forming labels to nodes and topology determining links. A contrast-insensitive similarity measure provides for invariance with respect to lighting conditions. The authors have formulated the matching procedure as an optimization task solved by diffusion of match points. This diffusion is controlled by a potential determined by jet similarity and the topology-preserving constraint. The algorithm implements a neural network architecture.<<ETX>>"

First, there is the problem of variable illumination, which can be addressed by working with relatively stable features such as intensity edges rather than the raw intensity images1,2. Second, there is the problem of the initially unknown pose of the object relative to the viewer. In one approach to this problem, a hypothesis is first made about the viewpoint, then the appearance of a model object from such a viewpoint is computed and compared with the actual image3\u20137. Such recognition schemes generally employ 3-D models of objects, but the automatic learning of 3-D models is itself a difficult problem8,9. To address this problem in computational vision, we have developed a scheme, based on the theory of approximation of multivariate functions, that learns from a small set of perspective views a function mapping any viewpoint to a standard view. A network equivalent to this scheme will thus 'recognize' the object on which it was trained from any viewpoint."

This study, however, demonstrates that these networks, radial basis function (RBF) networks, and k nearest-neighbor (kNN) classifiers, all provide similar low error rates on a large handwritten digit database. The backpropagation network is overall superior in memory usage and classification time but can provide false positive classifications when the input is not a digit. The backpropagation network also has the longest training time. The RBF classifier requires more memory and more classification time, but less training time. When high accuracy is warranted, the RBF classifier can generate a more effective confidence judgment for rejecting ambiguous inputs. The simple kNN classifier can also perform handwritten digit recognition, but requires a prohibitively large amount of memory and is much slower at classification. Nevertheless, the simplicity of the algorithm and fast training characteristics makes the kNN classifier an attractive candidate in hardware-assisted classification tasks. These results on a large, high input dimensional problem demonstrate that practical constraints including training time, memory usage, and classification time often constrain classifier selection more strongly than small differences in overall error rate."

Marr, Julesz, and others have proposed that texture is represented by small lines or blobs, called 'textons' by Julesz (1981a), together with their attributes, such as orientation, elongation, and intensity. Psychophysical studies suggest that texture boundaries are perceived where distributions of attributes over neighborhoods of textons differ significantly. However, these studies, which deal with synthetic images, neglect to consider two important questions: How can these textons be extracted from images of natural scenes? And how, exactly, are texture boundaries then found? This thesis proposes answers to these questions by presenting an algorithm for computing blobs from natural images and a statistic for measuring the difference between two sample distributions of blob attributes. As part of the blob detection algorithm, methods for estimating image noise are presented, which are applicable to edge detection as well."

                "text": "Even if represented in a way which is invariant to illumination conditions, a 3D object gives rise to an infinite number of 2D views, depending on its pose. It has been recently shown ([13]) that it is possible to synthesize a module that can recognize a specific 3D object from any viewpoint, by using a new technique of learning from examples, which are, in this case, a small set of 2D views of the object. In this paper we extend the technique, a) to deal with real objects (isolated paper clips) that suffer from noise and occlusions and b) to exploit negative examples during the learning phase. We also compare different versions of the multi-layer networks corresponding to our technique among themselves and with a standard Nearest Neighbor classifier. The simplest version, which is a Radial Basis Functions network, performs less well than a Nearest Neighbor classi-fier. The more powerful versions, trained with positive and negative examples, perform significantly better. Our results, which may have interesting implications for computer vision despite the relative simplicity of the task studied, are especially interesting for understanding the process of object recognition in biological vision. 1 Introduction Shape-based visual recognition of 3D objects may be solved by first hypothesizing the viewpoint (e.g., using information on feature correspondences between the image and a 3D model), then computing the appearance of the model of the object to be recognized from that viewpoint and comparing it with the actual image ([6; 20; 9; 11; 21]). Most recognition schemes developed in computer vision over the last few years employ 3D models of objects. Automatic learning of 3D models, however, is in itself a difficult problem that has not been much addressed in the past and which presents difficulties, especially for any theory that wants to account for human ability in visual recognition. Recently, recognition schemes have been suggested that, relying on a set of 2D views of the object instead of a 3D model ([2; 5; 13]), offer a natural solution to the problem of model acquisition. In particular, Poggio and Edelman ([13]) have argued that for each object there exists a smooth function mapping any perspective view into a \"standard\" view of the object and that this mul-tivariate function may be approximatevely synthesized from a small number of views of the object. Such a function would be object specific, with different functions corresponding to different 3D objects. \u2026"

We then describe the main features of a project of this type, MAIA, which is under development at I.R.S.T. The vision components of the system will be discussed in some detail, especially the navigation architecture of the indoor robot available to MAIA. We will conclude outlining some initial learning problems that will be approached within the MAIA project, such as learning to recognize faces and learning to update the map of the Institute used for indoor navigation."

Regularization theory and a theoretical framework for approximation (based on regularization techniques) that leads to a class of three-layer networks called regularization networks are discussed. Regularization networks are mathematically related to the radial basis functions, mainly used for strict interpolation tasks. Learning as approximation and learning as hypersurface reconstruction are discussed. Two extensions of the regularization approach are presented, along with the approach's corrections to splines, regularization, Bayes formulation, and clustering. The theory of regularization networks is generalized to a formulation that includes task-dependent clustering and dimensionality reduction. Applications of regularization networks are discussed. >"

The theory predicts a type of population coding that represents an extension of schemes such as look-up tables."
