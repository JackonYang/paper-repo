One such representation, called layered representation, has recently been proposed. Although a number of algorithms have been developed for computing these representations, there has not been a consolidated effort into developing a precise mathematical formulation of the problem. This paper presents one such formulation based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of mixture models and the minimum description length (MDL) encoding principle. The three major issues in layered motion representation are: (i) how many motion models adequately describe image motion, (ii) what are the motion model parameters, and (iii) what is the spatial support layer for each motion model.<<ETX>>"

The model employs parallel robust estimation techniques, and uses a minimal-covering optimization to estimate the number of objects in the scene.

This merging process raises many issues. These include the treatment of outliers in component velocity measurements and the modeling of multiple motions within a patch which arise from occlusion boundaries or transparency. A new approach for dealing with these issues is presented. It is based on the use of a probabilistic mixture model to explicitly represent multiple motions within a patch. A simple extension of the EM-algorithm is used to compute a maximum likelihood estimate for the various motion parameters. Preliminary experiments indicate that this approach is computationally efficient, and that it can provide robust estimates of the optical flow values in the presence of outliers and multiple motions.<<ETX>>"

The authors present a new region description method for dealing with this mutual dependence problem. Segmentation and motion estimation are simultaneously performed by a clustering process based on color, motion, and pixel position. As a result of the clustering, an image is decomposed into region fragments. Each fragment is characterized by distribution parameters of color, pixel positions, and spatiotemporal intensity gradients. The image is described by the parameters of the region fragments; 2-D motion vectors for each fragment are obtained from the distribution parameters of the intensity gradients. By combining those features in the clustering process, regions are segmented more precisely, motion boundaries are not blurred, and the 2-D motions are obtained even in noisy areas.

The approach exploits brightness information to organize and constrain the interpretation of the motion by using segmented regions of piecewise smooth brightness to hypothesize planar regions in the scene. Parametric flow models are fitted to these regions an a two step process which first computes a coarse fit and then refines it using a generalization of the standard area-based regression approaches. Since the assumption of planarity is likely to be violated, we allow local deformations from the planar assumption. This parametric+deformation model exploits the strong constraints of parametric approaches while retaining the adaptive nature of regularization approaches.<<ETX>>"

In this approach, the problem of model parameter estimation is formulated as a problem of parameter estimation from incomplete data, and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is used to determine a maximum-likelihood (ML) estimate. Previously, the use of the EM algorithm in this application has encountered difficulties since an analytical expression for the conditional expectations required in the EM procedure is generally unavailable, except for the simplest models. In this paper, two solutions are proposed to solve this problem: a Monte Carlo scheme and a scheme related to Besag's (1986) iterated conditional mode (ICM) method. Both schemes make use of Markov random-field modeling assumptions. Examples are provided to illustrate the implementation of the EM algorithm for several general classes of image models. Experimental results on both synthetic and real images are provided."

Each layer contains an intensity map that defines the additive values of each pixel, along with an alpha map that serves as a mask indicating the transparency. The layers are ordered in depth and they occlude each other in accord with the rules of compositing. Velocity maps define how the layers are to be warped over time. The layered representation is more flexible than standard image transforms and can capture many important properties of natural image sequences. We describe some methods for decomposing image sequences into layers using motion analysis, and we discuss how the representation may be used for image coding and other applications."

The algorithm derives from a new kind of competitive clustering model, in which the cluster generators compete to explain each feature of the data set and cooperate to explain each input example, rather than competing for examples and cooperating on features, as in traditional clustering algorithms. A natural extension of the algorithm recovers hierarchical models of data generated from multiple unknown categories, each with a different, multiple causal structure. Several simulations demonstrate the power of this approach."
