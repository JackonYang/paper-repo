Large intra-class variability of object appearance is dealt with by combining statistical local part detection with relations between object parts in a probabilistic network. Inference for view-based object recognition is done either with A\u2217-search employing a novel and dedicated admissible heuristic, or with Belief Propagation, depending on the network size. \n \nOur approach is applicable to arbitrary object classes. We validate this for \u201cfaces\u201d and for \u201carticulated humans\u201d. In the former case, our approach shows performance equal or superior to dedicated face recognition approaches. In the latter case, widely different poses and object appearances in front of cluttered backgrounds can be recognized."

We achieve this using a model developed in the statistical text literature: probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA). In text analysis, this is used to discover topics in a corpus using the bag-of-words document representation. Here we treat object categories as topics, so that an image containing instances of several categories is modeled as a mixture of topics. The model is applied to images by using a visual analogue of a word, formed by vector quantizing SIFT-like region descriptors. The topic discovery approach successfully translates to the visual domain: for a small set of objects, we show that both the object categories and their approximate spatial layout are found without supervision. Performance of this unsupervised method is compared to the supervised approach of Fergus et al. (2003) on a set of unseen images containing only one object per image. We also extend the bag-of-words vocabulary to include 'doublets' which encode spatially local co-occurring regions. It is demonstrated that this extended vocabulary gives a cleaner image segmentation. Finally, the classification and segmentation methods are applied to a set of images containing multiple objects per image. These results demonstrate that we can successfully build object class models from an unsupervised analysis of images."

The model is a sparse representation of the object, and consists of a star topology configuration of parts modeling the output of a variety of feature detectors. The optimal choice of feature types (whose repertoire includes interest points, curves and regions) is made automatically. In recognition, the model may be applied efficiently in an exhaustive manner, bypassing the need for feature detectors, to give the globally optimal match within a query image. The approach is demonstrated on a wide variety of categories, and delivers both successful classification and localization of the object within the image."

Given a set of images known to contain the target category from a similar viewpoint, learning is translation and scale-invariant; does not require alignment or correspondence between the training images, and is robust to clutter and occlusion. Category models are probabilistic constellations of parts, and their parameters are estimated by maximizing the likelihood of the training data. The appearance of the parts, as well as their mutual position, relative scale and probability of detection are explicitly described in the model. Recognition takes place in two stages. First, a feature-finder identifies promising locations for the model\u201ds parts. Second, the category model is used to compare the likelihood that the observed features are generated by the category model, or are generated by background clutter. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by results over six diverse object categories including geometrically constrained categories (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

No feature correspondence is needed among exemplars, just a suitable pairwise similarity measure. The approach uses a template tree to efficiently represent and match the variety of shape exemplars. The tree is generated offline by a bottom-up clustering approach using stochastic optimization. Online matching involves a simultaneous coarse-to-fine approach over the template tree and over the transformation parameters. The main contribution of this paper is a Bayesian model to estimate the a posteriori probability of the object class, after a certain match at a node of the tree. This model takes into account object scale and saliency and allows for a principled setting of the matching thresholds such that unpromising paths in the tree traversal process are eliminated early on. The proposed approach was tested in a variety of application domains. Here, results are presented on one of the more challenging domains: real-time pedestrian detection from a moving vehicle. A significant speed-up is obtained when comparing the proposed probabilistic matching approach with a manually tuned nonprobabilistic variant, both utilizing the same template tree structure."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts conditioned on local observations found by an interest operator. For each object class the probability of a given assignment of parts to local features is modeled by a Conditional Random Field (CRF). We propose an extension of the CRF framework that incorporates hidden variables and combines class conditional CRFs into a unified framework for part-based object recognition. The parameters of the CRF are estimated in a maximum likelihood framework and recognition proceeds by finding the most likely class under our model. The main advantage of the proposed CRF framework is that it allows us to relax the assumption of conditional independence of the observed data (i.e. local features) often used in generative approaches, an assumption that might be too restrictive for a considerable number of object classes."

However, there usually is time to train the system, which we would show to be very useful. Assuming that several registered images of the target object are available, we developed a keypoint-based approach that is effective in this context by formulating wide-baseline matching of keypoints extracted from the input images to those found in the model images as a classification problem. This shifts much of the computational burden to a training phase, without sacrificing recognition performance. As a result, the resulting algorithm is robust, accurate, and fast-enough for frame-rate performance. This reduction in runtime computational complexity is our first contribution. Our second contribution is to show that, in this context, a simple and fast keypoint detector suffices to support detection and tracking even under large perspective and scale variations. While earlier methods require a detector that can be expected to produce very repeatable results, in general, which usually is very time-consuming, we simply find the most repeatable object keypoints for the specific target object during the training phase. We have incorporated these ideas into a real-time system that detects planar, nonplanar, and deformable objects. It then estimates the pose of the rigid ones and the deformations of the others"

Humans are modeled as flexible assemblies of parts, and robust part detection is the key to the approach. The parts are represented by co-occurrences of local features which captures the spatial layout of the partrsquos appearance. Feature selection and the part detectors are learnt from training images using AdaBoost. The detection algorithm is very efficient as (i) all part detectors use the same initial features, (ii) a coarse-to-fine cascade approach is used for part detection, (iii) a part assembly strategy reduces the number of spurious detections and the search space. The results outperform existing human detectors."

It is able to perform estimation efficiently in the presence significant background clutter, large foreground variation, self-occlusion and occlusion by other objects. This is achieved through two key developments. Firstly, a new formulation is proposed that allows partial configurations, hypotheses with differing numbers of parts, to be made and compared. This permits efficient global sampling in the presence of self and other object occlusions without prior knowledge of body part visibility. Secondly, a highly discriminatory likelihood model is proposed comprising two complementary components. A boundary component improves upon previous appearance distribution divergence methods by incorporating high-level shape and appearance information and hence better discriminates textured, overlapping body parts. An inter-part component uses appearance similarity of body parts to reduce the number of false-positive, multi-part hypotheses, hence increasing estimation efficiency. Results are presented for challenging images with unknown subject and large variations in subject appearance, scale and pose."

However, effective and efficient multiviewpoint detection of objects is still in its infancy, since most current approaches can only handle single viewpoints or aspects. This paper proposes a general approach for multiaspect detection of objects. As the running example for detection we use pedestrians, which add another difficulty to the problem, namely human body articulations. Global appearance changes caused by different articulations and viewpoints of pedestrians are handled in a unified manner by a generalization of the Implicit Shape Model [5]. An important property of this new approach is to share local appearance across different articulations and viewpoints, therefore requiring relatively few training samples. The effectiveness of the approach is shown and compared to previous approaches on two datasets containing pedestrians with different articulations and from multiple viewpoints."

While impressive achievements have been made in pattern classification problems such as handwritten character recognition, face detection, speaker identification, and prediction of gene function, it is even more exciting that researchers are on the verge of introducing systems that can perform large-scale combinatorial analyses of data, decomposing the data into interacting components. For example, computational methods for automatic scene analysis are now emerging in the computer vision community. These methods decompose an input image into its constituent objects, lighting conditions, motion patterns, etc. Two of the main challenges are finding effective representations and models in specific applications and finding efficient algorithms for inference and learning in these models. In this paper, we advocate the use of graph-based probability models and their associated inference and learning algorithms. We review exact techniques and various approximate, computationally efficient techniques, including iterated conditional modes, the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, Gibbs sampling, the mean field method, variational techniques, structured variational techniques and the sum-product algorithm (\"loopy\" belief propagation). We describe how each technique can be applied in a vision model of multiple, occluding objects and contrast the behaviors and performances of the techniques using a unifying cost function, free energy."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

                "text": "Graphical models provide an attractive framework for shape matching because they are well-suited to formulating Bayesian models of deformable templates. In addition, the advent of powerful inference techniques such as belief propagation (BP) has recently made these models tractable. However, the enormous size of the state spaces involved in these applications (about the size of the pixel lattice) has restricted their use to models drawing on sparse feature maps (e.g. edges), which are typically unable to cope with missing or occluded features since the locations of missing features are not represented in the state space. We propose a novel method for allowing BP to handle partial occlusions in the presence of clutter, which we call dynamic quantization (DQ). DQ is an extension of standard pruning techniques which allows BP to adaptively add as well as subtract states as needed. Since DQ allows BP to focus on more probable regions of the image, the state space can be adaptively enlarged to include locations where features are occluded, without the computational burden of representing all possible pixel locations. The combination of BP and DQ yields deformable templates that are both fast and robust to significant occlusions, without requiring any user initialization. Experimental results are shown on deformable templates of planar shapes."

This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms) of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Mover\u2019s Distance and the \u03c72 distance. We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class variations and substantial background clutter."

We review the state-of-the-art in evaluated methods for both classification and detection, analyse whether the methods are statistically different, what they are learning from the images (e.g. the object or its context), and what the methods find easy or confuse.

This problem is difficult because one needs to determine both the number of people in each frame and estimate their configurations. But, finding people and localizing their limbs is hard because people can move fast and unpredictably, can appear in a variety of poses and clothes, and are often surrounded by limb-like clutter. We develop a completely automatic system that works in two stages; it first builds a model of appearance of each person in a video and then it tracks by detecting those models in each frame (\"tracking by model-building and detection\"). We develop two algorithms that build models; one bottom-up approach groups together candidate body parts found throughout a sequence. We also describe a top-down approach that automatically builds people-models by detecting convenient key poses within a sequence. We finally show that building a discriminative model of appearance is quite helpful since it exploits structure in a background (without background-subtraction). We demonstrate the resulting tracker on hundreds of thousands of frames of unscripted indoor and outdoor activity, a feature-length film (\"Run Lola Run\"), and legacy sports footage (from the 2002 World Series and 1998 Winter Olympics). Experiments suggest that our system 1) can count distinct individuals, 2) can identify and track them, 3) can recover when it loses track, for example, if individuals are occluded or briefly leave the view, 4) can identify body configuration accurately, and 5) is not dependent on particular models of human motion"

Our work is motivated by the pictorial structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager. The basic idea is to represent an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems. We address the problem of using pictorial structure models to find instances of an object in an image as well as the problem of learning an object model from training examples, presenting efficient algorithms in both cases. We demonstrate the techniques by learning models that represent faces and human bodies and using the resulting models to locate the corresponding objects in novel images."

In our method pose clusters are learned from an embedded silhouette manifold. A set of object detectors, each of which corresponds to one pose cluster, are trained based on a novel Object-Weighted Appearance Model. A probabilistic pose-based transition model is used to track multiple objects within a sliding window buffer, making use of the detection responses. The track segments in the sliding windows are connected sequentially into full trajectories. Experiments on a set of challenging surveillance videos are presented; these show good performance of our approach compared to standard pedestrian detectors, under difficult conditions."

There are two kinds of edges defined in the body part relation graph: Strong (tree) edges corresponding to the body plan that can enforce any type of constraint, and weak (non-tree) edges that express exclusion constraints arising from inter-part occlusion and symmetry conditions. We express optimal part localization as a multiple shortest path problem in a set of correlated trellises constructed from the graph model. Strong model edges generate the trellises, while weak model edges prohibit implausible poses by generating exclusion constraints among trellis nodes and edges. The optimization may be expressed as an integer linear program and solved using a novel two-stage relaxation scheme. Experiments show that the proposed method has a high chance of obtaining the globally optimal pose at low computational cost."

Given the surface model of an object that is visible in the image of one or multiple cameras calibrated to the same world coordinate system, the object contour extracted by the segmentation method is applied to estimate the 3-D pose parameters of the object. Vice-versa, the surface model projected to the image plane helps in a top-down manner to improve the extraction of the contour. While common alternative segmentation approaches, which integrate 2-D shape knowledge, face the problem that an object can look very differently from various viewpoints, a 3-D free form model ensures that for each view the model can fit the data in the image very well. Moreover, one additionally solves the problem of determining the object\u2019s pose in 3-D space. The performance is demonstrated by numerous experiments with a monocular and a stereo camera system."

The model applies to problems of temporal and uncertain inference and represents the unexplored bottom-up counterpart of pervasive generative models estimated with Kalman filtering or particle filtering. Instead of inverting a nonlinear generative observation model at runtime, we learn to cooperatively predict complex state distributions directly from descriptors that encode image observations (typically, bag-of-feature global image histograms or descriptors computed over regular spatial grids). These are integrated in a conditional graphical model in order to enforce temporal smoothness constraints and allow a principled management of uncertainty. The algorithms combine sparsity, mixture modeling, and nonlinear dimensionality reduction for efficient computation in high-dimensional continuous state spaces. The combined system automatically self-initializes and recovers from failure. The research has three contributions: (1) we establish the density propagation rules for discriminative inference in continuous, temporal chain models, (2) we propose flexible supervised and unsupervised algorithms to learn feed-forward, multivalued contextual mappings (multimodal state distributions) based on compact, conditional Bayesian mixture of experts models, and (3) we validate the framework empirically for the reconstruction of 3D human motion in monocular video sequences. Our tests on both real and motion-capture-based sequences show significant performance gains with respect to competing nearest neighbor, regression, and structured prediction methods."

The proposed framework utilizes tools from the duality theory of linear programming in order to provide an alternative and more general view of state-of-the-art techniques like the alpha-expansion algorithm, which is included merely as a special case. Moreover, contrary to alpha-expansion, the derived algorithms generate solutions with guaranteed optimality properties for a much wider class of problems, for example, even for MRFs with nonmetric potentials. In addition, they are capable of providing per-instance suboptimality bounds in all occasions, including discrete MRFs with an arbitrary potential function. These bounds prove to be very tight in practice (that is, very close to 1), which means that the resulting solutions are almost optimal. Our algorithms' effectiveness is demonstrated by presenting experimental results on a variety of low-level vision tasks, such as stereo matching, image restoration, image completion, and optical flow estimation, as well as on synthetic problems."

Human pose estimation can be made more robust by integrating the detection of body components such as face and limbs, with the highly constrained structure of the articulated body. In this paper, a data-driven approach based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (DD-MCMC) is used, where component detection results generate state proposals for 3D pose estimation. To translate these observations into pose hypotheses, we introduce the use of \"proposal maps,\" an efficient way of consolidating the evidence and generating 3D pose candidates during the MCMC search. Experimental results on a set of test images show that the method is able to estimate the human pose in static images of real scenes."

The main goals of these two workshops were (1) to promote the creation of an international object recognition community, with common datasets and evaluation procedures, (2) to map the state of the art and identify the main open problems and opportunities for synergistic research, and (3) to articulate the industrial and societal needs and opportunities for object recognition research worldwide. These goals are reflected in a relatively small number of papers that illustrate the breadth of today's object recognition research and the arsenal of techniques at its disposal, and discuss current achievements and outstanding challenges. Most of the chapters are descriptions of technical approaches, intended to capture the current state of the art. Some of the chapters are of a tutorial nature. They cover fundamental building blocks for object recognition techniques."

These approaches admit efficient inference algorithms while capturing the important kinematic constraints of the human body as a graphical model. These methods often fail however when multiple body parts fit the same image region resulting in global pose estimates that poorly explain the overall image evidence. Attempts to solve this problem have focused on the use of strong prior models that are limited to learned activities such as walking. We argue that the problem actually lies with the image observations and not with the prior. In particular, image evidence for each body part is estimated independently of other parts without regard to self-occlusion. To address this we introduce occlusion-sensitive local likelihoods that approximate the global image likelihood using per-pixel hidden binary variables that encode the occlusion relationships between parts. This occlusion reasoning introduces interactions between non-adjacent body parts creating loops in the underlying graphical model. We deal with this using an extension of an approximate belief propagation algorithm (PAMPAS). The algorithm recovers the real-valued 2D pose of the body in the presence of occlusions, does not require strong priors over body pose and does a quantitatively better job of explaining image evidence than previous methods."

We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

Unlike other related state of the art techniques which focus on either segmentation or pose estimation individually, our approach tackles these two tasks together. Normally, when optimizing for pose, it is traditional to use some fixed set of features, e.g. edges or chamfer maps. In contrast, our novel approach consists of optimizing a cost function based on a Markov Random Field (MRF). This has the advantage that we can use all the information in the image: edges, background and foreground appearances, as well as the prior information on the shape and pose of the subject and combine them in a Bayesian framework. Previously, optimizing such a cost function would have been computationally infeasible. However, our recent research in dynamic graph cuts allows this to be done much more efficiently than before. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on challenging motion sequences. Note that although we target the human pose inference problem in the paper, our method is completely generic and can be used to segment and infer the pose of any specified rigid, deformable or articulated object."

This bag of keypoints method is based on vector quantization of affine invariant descriptors of image patches. We propose and compare two alternative implementations using different classifiers: Naive Bayes and SVM. The main advantages of the method are that it is simple, computationally efficient and intrinsically invariant. We present results for simultaneously classifying seven semantic visual categories. These results clearly demonstrate that the method is robust to background clutter and produces good categorization accuracy even without exploiting geometric information."

The template is formulated as a Bayesian graphical model of a two-dimensional shape contour, and it is matched to the image using a variant of the belief propagation (BP) algorithm used for inference on graphical models. The algorithm can localize a target shape contour in a cluttered image and can accommodate arbitrary global translation and rotation of the target as well as significant shape deformations, without requiring the template to be initialized in any special way (e.g. near the target).The use of BP removes a serious restriction imposed in related earlier work, in which the matching is performed by dynamic programming and thus requires the graphical model to be tree-shaped (i.e. without loops). Although BP is not guaranteed to converge when applied to inference on non-tree-shaped graphs, we find empirically that it does converge even for deformable template models with one or more loops. To speed up the BP algorithm, we augment it by a pruning procedure and a novel technique, inspired by the 20 Questions (divide-and-conquer) search strategy, called \"focused message updating.\" These modifications boost the speed of convergence by over an order of magnitude, resulting in an algorithm that detects and localizes shapes in grayscale images in as little as several seconds on an 850 MHz AMD processor."

Known techniques include graph cuts, belief propagation (BP) and recently introduced tree-reweighted message passing (TRW). So far, the standard benchmark for their comparison has been a 4-connected grid-graph arising in pixel-labelling stereo. This minimization problem, however, has been largely solved: recent work shows that for many scenes TRW finds the global optimum. Furthermore, it is known that a 4-connected grid-graph is a poor stereo model since it does not take occlusions into account. \n \nWe propose the problem of stereo with occlusions as a new test bed for minimization algorithms. This is a more challenging graph since it has much larger connectivity, and it also serves as a better stereo model. An attractive feature of this problem is that increased connectivity does not result in increased complexity of message passing algorithms. Indeed, one contribution of this paper is to show that sophisticated implementations of BP and TRW have the same time and memory complexity as that of 4-connected grid-graph stereo. \n \nThe main conclusion of our experimental study is that for our problem graph cut outperforms both TRW and BP considerably. TRW achieves consistently a lower energy than BP. However, as connectivity increases the speed of convergence of TRW becomes slower. Unlike 4-connected grids, the difference between the energy of the best optimization method and the lower bound of TRW appears significant. This shows the hardness of the problem and motivates future research."

Our approach requires neither an explicit body model nor prior labeling of body parts in the image. Instead, it recovers pose by direct nonlinear regression against shape descriptor vectors extracted automatically from image silhouettes. For robustness against local silhouette segmentation errors, silhouette shape is encoded by histogram-of-shape-contexts descriptors. We evaluate several different regression methods: ridge regression, relevance vector machine (RVM) regression, and support vector machine (SVM) regression over both linear and kernel bases. The RVMs provide much sparser regressors without compromising performance, and kernel bases give a small but worthwhile improvement in performance. The loss of depth and limb labeling information often makes the recovery of 3D pose from single silhouettes ambiguous. To handle this, the method is embedded in a novel regressive tracking framework, using dynamics from the previous state estimate together with a learned regression value to disambiguate the pose. We show that the resulting system tracks long sequences stably. For realism and good generalization over a wide range of viewpoints, we train the regressors on images resynthesized from real human motion capture data. The method is demonstrated for several representations of full body pose, both quantitatively on independent but similar test data and qualitatively on real image sequences. Mean angular errors of 4-6/spl deg/ are obtained for a variety of walking motions."

Such video material is uncontrolled and extremely challenging. We propose an approach that progressively reduces the search space for body parts, to greatly improve the chances that pose estimation will succeed. This involves two contributions: (i) a generic detector using a weak model of pose to substantially reduce the full pose search space; and (ii) employing 'grabcut' initialized on detected regions proposed by the weak model, to further prune the search space. Moreover, we also propose (Hi) an integrated spatio- temporal model covering multiple frames to refine pose estimates from individual frames, with inference using belief propagation. The method is fully automatic and self-initializing, and explains the spatio-temporal volume covered by a person moving in a shot, by soft-labeling every pixel as belonging to a particular body part or to the background. We demonstrate upper-body pose estimation by an extensive evaluation over 70000 frames from four episodes of the TV series Buffy the vampire slayer, and present an application to full- body action recognition on the Weizmann dataset."

We point out that formulating a problem as Bayesian inference implies specifying a probability distribution on the ensemble of problem instances. This ensemble can be used for analyzing the expected complexity of algorithms and also the algorithm-independent limits of inference. We illustrate this problem by analyzing the complexity of tree search. In particular, we study the problem of road detection, as formulated by Geman and Jedynak (1996). We prove that the expected convergence is linear in the size of the road (the depth of the tree) even though the worst-case performance is exponential. We also put a bound on the constant of the convergence and place a bound on the error rates."

                "text": "One of the most exciting advances in early vision has been the development of efficient energy minimization algorithms. Many early vision tasks require labeling each pixel with some quantity such as depth or texture. While many such problems can be elegantly expressed in the language of Markov Random Fields (MRF's), the resulting energy minimization problems were widely viewed as intractable. Recently, algorithms such as graph cuts and loopy belief propagation (LBP) have proven to be very powerful: for example, such methods form the basis for almost all the top-performing stereo methods. Unfortunately, most papers define their own energy function, which is minimized with a specific algorithm of their choice. As a result, the tradeoffs among different energy minimization algorithms are not well understood. In this paper we describe a set of energy minimization benchmarks, which we use to compare the solution quality and running time of several common energy minimization algorithms. We investigate three promising recent methods\u2014graph cuts, LBP, and tree-reweighted message passing\u2014as well as the well-known older iterated conditional modes (ICM) algorithm. Our benchmark problems are drawn from published energy functions used for stereo, image stitching and interactive segmentation. We also provide a general-purpose software interface that allows vision researchers to easily switch between optimization methods with minimal overhead. We expect that the availability of our benchmarks and interface will make it significantly easier for vision researchers to adopt the best method for their specific problems. Benchmarks, code, results and images are available at http://vision.middlebury.edu/MRF."

By decomposing the original distribution into a convex combination of tree-structured distributions, we obtain an upper bound on the optimal value of the original problem (i.e., the log probability of the MAP assignment) in terms of the combined optimal values of the tree problems. We prove that this upper bound is tight if and only if all the tree distributions share an optimal configuration in common. An important implication is that any such shared configuration must also be a MAP configuration for the original distribution. Next we develop two approaches to attempting to obtain tight upper bounds: a) a tree-relaxed linear program (LP), which is derived from the Lagrangian dual of the upper bounds; and b) a tree-reweighted max-product message-passing algorithm that is related to but distinct from the max-product algorithm. In this way, we establish a connection between a certain LP relaxation of the mode-finding problem and a reweighted form of the max-product (min-sum) message-passing algorithm."

We propose a probabilistic technique that utilizes a multi-component Gaussian mixture model to describe the spatial distribution of voxels in a voxel image. Each component describes a segment or rigid body, and the collection of components are kinematically constrained according to a pre-specified skeletal model. This model we refer to as a kinematically constrained Gaussian mixture model (kc-gmm). Pairs of components connected at a common joint are encouraged to assume a particular spatial configuration, forming a 1, 2 or 3 degree-of-freedom (DOF) joint. The pose learning algorithm, based on the EM algorithm, is evaluated using synthesized hand data, and the HumanEvaII dataset for facilitating algorithm comparison among different algorithms. Both datasets contain groundtruth information for accuracy measurements. A 16 component, 27 DOF mixture hand model and an 11 segment, 19 DOF mixture human body model were used. The results show that utilizing volume data, aided only by the degreesof-freedom constraints, show accuracies of joint location estimates within 0.5cm mean-absolute-error from groundtruth with the hand data set and 17cm from subjects S2 and S4 from the HumanEvaII datasets."

We present dynamic conditional random fields (DCRFs), a generalization of linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) in which each time slice contains a set of state variables and edges---a distributed state representation as in dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs)---and parameters are tied across slices. Since exact inference can be intractable in such models, we perform approximate inference using several schedules for belief propagation, including tree-based reparameterization (TRP). On a natural-language chunking task, we show that a DCRF performs better than a series of linear-chain CRFs, achieving comparable performance using only half the training data."

The basic approach is to store a number of exemplar 2D views of the human body in a variety of different configurations and viewpoints with respect to the camera. On each of these stored views, the locations of the body joints (left elbow, right knee, etc.) are manually marked and labeled for future use. The input image is then matched to each stored view, using the technique of shape context matching in conjunction with a kinematic chain-based deformation model. Assuming that there is a stored view sufficiently similar in configuration and pose, the correspondence process would succeed. The locations of the body joints are then transferred from the exemplar view to the test shape. Given the 2D joint locations, the 3D body configuration and pose are then estimated using an existing algorithm. We can apply this technique to video by treating each frame independently - tracking just becomes repeated recognition. We present results on a variety of data sets"

We review a not widely known approach to the problem, developed by Ukrainian researchers Schlesinger et al. in 1976, and show how it contributes to recent results, most importantly, those on the convex combination of trees and tree-reweighted max-product. In particular, we review Schlesinger et al.'s upper bound on the max-sum criterion, its minimization by equivalent transformations, its relation to the constraint satisfaction problem, the fact that this minimization is dual to a linear programming relaxation of the original problem, and the three kinds of consistency necessary for optimality of the upper bound. We revisit problems with Boolean variables and supermodular problems. We describe two algorithms for decreasing the upper bound. We present an example application for structural image analysis."

In human shape and pose estimation, cast shadows can be confused with foreground structure while self shadowing and shading variation on the body cause the appearance of the person to change with pose. Rather than attempt to minimize the effects of lighting and shadows, we show that strong lighting in a scene actually makes pose and shape estimation more robust. Additionally, by recovering multiple body poses we are able to automatically estimate the lighting in the scene and the albedo of the body. Our approach makes use of a detailed 3D body model, the parameters of which are directly recovered from image data. We provide a thorough exploration of human pose estimation under strong lighting conditions and show: 1. the estimation of the light source from cast shadows; 2. the estimation of the light source and the albedo of the body from multiple body poses; 3. that a point light and cast shadows on the ground plane can be treated as an additional \"shadow camera\" that improves pose and shape recovery, particularly in monocular scenes. Additionally we introduce the notion of albedo constancy which employs lighting normalized image data for matching. Our experiments with multiple subjects show that rather than causing problems, strong lighting improves human pose and shape estimation."

The belief propagation (BP) algorithm is an efficient way to solve these problems that is exact when the factor graph is a tree, but only approximate when the factor graph has cycles. We show that BP fixed points correspond to the stationary points of the Bethe approximation of the free energy for a factor graph. We explain how to obtain region-based free energy approximations that improve the Bethe approximation, and corresponding generalized belief propagation (GBP) algorithms. We emphasize the conditions a free energy approximation must satisfy in order to be a \"valid\" or \"maxent-normal\" approximation. We describe the relationship between four different methods that can be used to generate valid approximations: the \"Bethe method\", the \"junction graph method\", the \"cluster variation method\", and the \"region graph method\". Finally, we explain how to tell whether a region-based approximation, and its corresponding GBP algorithm, is likely to be accurate, and describe empirical results showing that GBP can significantly outperform BP."

(Nov. 2005)- tree-reweighted max-product message passing (TRW). It was inspired by the problem of maximizing a lower bound on the energy. However, the algorithm is not guaranteed to increase this bound - it may actually go down. In addition, TRW does not always converge. We develop a modification of this algorithm which we call sequential tree-reweighted message passing. Its main property is that the bound is guaranteed not to decrease. We also give a weak tree agreement condition which characterizes local maxima of the bound with respect to TRW algorithms. We prove that our algorithm has a limit point that achieves weak tree agreement. Finally, we show that, our algorithm requires half as much memory as traditional message passing approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that on certain synthetic and real problems, our algorithm outperforms both the ordinary belief propagation and tree-reweighted algorithm in (M. J. Wainwright, et al., Nov. 2005). In addition, on stereo problems with Potts interactions, we obtain a lower energy than graph cuts"

                "text": "While research on articulated human motion and pose estimation has progressed rapidly in the last few years, there has been no systematic quantitative evaluation of competing methods to establish the current state of the art. Current algorithms make many different choices about how to model the human body, how to exploit image evidence and how to approach the inference problem. We argue that there is a need for common datasets that allow fair comparison between different methods and their design choices. Until recently gathering ground-truth data for evaluation of results (especially in 3D) was challenging. In this report we present a novel dataset obtained using a unique setup for capturing synchronized video and ground-truth 3D motion. Data was captured simultaneously using a calibrated marker-based motion capture system and multiple high-speed video capture systems. The video and motion capture streams were synchronized in software using a direct optimization method. The resulting HumanEvaI dataset contains multiple subjects performing a set of predefined actions with a number of repetitions. On the order of 50,000 frames of synchronized motion capture and video was collected at 60 Hz with an additional 37,000 frames of pure motion capture data. The data is partitioned into training, validation, and testing sub-sets. A standard set of error metrics is defined that can be used for evaluation of both 2D and 3D pose estimation and tracking algorithms. Support software and an on-line evaluation system for quantifying results using the test data is being made available to the community. This report provides an overview of the dataset and evaluation metrics and provides pointers into the dataset for additional details. It is our hope that HumanEva-I will become a standard dataset for the evaluation of articulated human motion and pose estimation."

This way of combining individual expert models makes it hard to generate samples from the combined model but easy to infer the values of the latent variables of each expert, because the combination rule ensures that the latent variables of different experts are conditionally independent when given the data. A product of experts (PoE) is therefore an interesting candidate for a perceptual system in which rapid inference is vital and generation is unnecessary. Training a PoE by maximizing the likelihood of the data is difficult because it is hard even to approximate the derivatives of the renormalization term in the combination rule. Fortunately, a PoE can be trained using a different objective function called contrastive divergence whose derivatives with regard to the parameters can be approximated accurately and efficiently. Examples are presented of contrastive divergence learning using several types of expert on several types of data."

Working in the computation-limited setting, we analyze a joint method in which the same convex variational relaxation is used to construct an M-estimator for fitting parameters, and to perform approximate marginalization for the prediction step. The key result of this paper is that in the computation-limited setting, using an inconsistent parameter estimator (i.e., an estimator that returns the \"wrong\" model even in the infinite data limit) is provably beneficial, since the resulting errors can partially compensate for errors made by using an approximate prediction technique. En route to this result, we analyze the asymptotic properties of M-estimators based on convex variational relaxations, and establish a Lipschitz stability property that holds for a broad class of variational methods. We show that joint estimation/prediction based on the reweighted sum-product algorithm substantially outperforms a commonly used heuristic based on ordinary sum-product."

The strength of the randomization can be tuned to problem specifics by the appropriate choice of a parameter. We evaluate the robustness of the default choice of this parameter, and we also provide insight on how to adjust it in particular situations. Besides accuracy, the main strength of the resulting algorithm is computational efficiency.

We also propose a new method for obtaining calibrated two-class probability estimates that can be applied to any classifier that produces a ranking of examples.

The fact that it is the margin, or confidence level, of a classification--that is, a scale parameter--rather than a raw training error that matters has become a key tool for dealing with classifiers. This book shows how this idea applies to both the theoretical analysis and the design of algorithms. \nThe book provides an overview of recent developments in large margin classifiers, examines connections with other methods (e.g., Bayesian inference), and identifies strengths and weaknesses of the method, as well as directions for future research. Among the contributors are Manfred Opper, Vladimir Vapnik, and Grace Wahba."

The development of the HumanEva I & II test sets provides an opportunity to assess the state of the art by evaluating existing methods on the new standardized test videos. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of a monocular recognition-based pose recovery algorithm on the HumanEva II clips. The results show that the method achieves a mean relative error of around 10-12 cm per joint."

Recently, a median filter for matrix-valued images has been introduced. We propose a new approach for the numerical computation of matrix-valued median filters, and closely related mid-range filters, based on sound convex programming techniques. Matrix-valued medians are uniquely computed as global optima with interior point solvers. The robust performance is validated with experimental results for matrix-valued data including texture analysis and denoising."

We begin by reviewing the concepts of calibration and refinement, and describiing the relationship between this notion of refinement and the notion of sufficiency in the comparison of statistical experiments. We also consider the question of interrelationships among forecasters and discuss methods by which an observer should combine the predictions from two or more different forecasters. Then we turn our attention to the concept of a proper scoring rule for evaluating forecasters, relating it to the concepts of calibration and refinement. Finally, we discuss conditions under which one fore- caster can exploit the predictions of another forecaster to obtain a better score. In this paper we describe some concepts and methods appropriate for evaluating and com- paring forecasters who repeatedly present their predictions of whether or not various events will occur in terms of their subjective probabilities of those events. The ideas we describe here are relevant in almost any situation in which forecasters must repeatedly make such probabilistic predictions, regardless of the particular subject matter or substantive area of the events being forecast. The forecaster might be an economist who at the beginning of each quarterly period makes predictions about unemployment, the rate of inflation, or Gross National Product in that quarter based on the values of various economic indicators; the forecaster might even make predictions using a large-scale econometric model of the United States economy based on hundreds of variables and econometric relations. In a different field, the forecaster might be the weatherman for a television station who at the beginning of each day must announce his probability that it will rain during the day. For ease of exposition, we present our discussions here in the context of such a weather forecaster who day after day must specify his subjective probability x that there will be at least a certain amount of rain at some given location during a specified time interval of the day. We refer to the occurrence of this well-specified event simply as \"rain\". Thus, at the begin- ning of each day the forecaster must specify his probability of rain and at the end of each day he observes whether or not rain actually occurred. The probability x specified by the forecaster on any particular day is called his prediction for that day. We shall make the realistic, and simultaneously simplifying, assumption that the"

The Special Topic on Machine Learning and Large Scale Optimization examines this interplay. Machine learning researchers have embraced the advances in mathematical programming allowing new types of models to be pursued. The special topic includes models using quadratic, linear, second-order cone, semi-definite, and semi-infinite programs. We observe that the qualities of good optimization algorithms from the machine learning and optimization perspectives can be quite different. Mathematical programming puts a premium on accuracy, speed, and robustness. Since generalization is the bottom line in machine learning and training is normally done off-line, accuracy and small speed improvements are of little concern in machine learning. Machine learning prefers simpler algorithms that work in reasonable computational time for specific classes of problems. Reducing machine learning problems to well-explored mathematical programming classes with robust general purpose optimization codes allows machine learning researchers to rapidly develop new techniques. In turn, machine learning presents new challenges to mathematical programming. The special issue include papers from two primary themes: novel machine learning models and novel optimization approaches for existing models. Many papers blend both themes, making small changes in the underlying core mathematical program that enable the develop of effective new algorithms."

Because the categorizing of the units is a consequence of some complex judgment process performed by a &dquo;two-legged meter&dquo; (Stevens, 1958), it becomes important to determine the extent to which these judgments are reproducible, i.e., reliable.
