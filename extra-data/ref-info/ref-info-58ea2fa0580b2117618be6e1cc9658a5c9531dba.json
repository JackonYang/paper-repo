A model was proposed to describe the different motion patterns in terms of the common and the relative motions of the moving parts. Using motion patterns consisting of two dots moving in straight paths, it was found that there were three different types of relative motions yielding unambiguous percepts: (1) lack of relative motions was perceived as motion in a frontoparallel plane; (2) two-dimensional concurrent motions were perceived as translatory motion in depth; (3) nonconcurrent motions were perceived as rotation in depth. Only two-dimensional motion patterns yielded stable depth percepts. The utility of the proposed vector analysis was discussed, and further research suggested."

The stimulation used was a straight line changing length and direction. For this stimulation a geometrical model was developed. The basic decoding principle in this model is that the changes in the two-dimensional figure will be perceived as three-dimensional motions of an object with constant shape and size. This principle was approximately verified for the majority of the data. The main deviation from the model was that there was generally less perceived depth than predicted. Also a second decoding principle was generally verified: rotary, but not translator motion is perceived from this kind of stimulation. A third unexpected decoding principle was found in the data: the line is perceived in a frontal-parallel direction when it has its maximal extention."

How, then, does the visual apparatus produce specific percepts from such non-specific changing stimuli? By applying an analogue computer technique, changing projections of artificial objects are generated on a CRT screen. These projections are fed into the eye by means of an optical device where they form a continuously changing solid angle of homogeneous light. The main conclusion is that it is a principle of perceptual three-dimensionality which gives specificity to the percepts. Preliminary statements of principles for prediction of perceived motion in depth from a given change in proximal stimulus are presented."

Another example is Green's excellent study of coherence in motion patterns (Green, 1961). This method of using bright spots as carriers of element motions in complex motion patterns has been applied also in the present study. It will allow us to analyze human motion patterns without interference from the pictorial information inherent in perception of the moving pattern. It goes without saying that the method described has nothing to do with the old sensation-perception controversy recently reactivated by Gibson (1966). The point motions will not be thought of as some kind of motion sensations."
