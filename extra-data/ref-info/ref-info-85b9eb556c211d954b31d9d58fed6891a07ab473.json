It depends on whether or not he is on a steam locomotive. I am trying to decide automatically which sense of a word is intended (in written English) by using machine readable dictionaries, and looking for words in the sense definitions that overlap words in the definition of nearby words. The problem of deciding which sense of a word was intended by the writer is an important problem in information retrieval systems. At present most retrieval systems rely on manual indexing; if this is to be replaced with automatic text processing, it would be very desirable to recognize the correct sense of each word as often as possible. Previous work has generally either suggested (a) detailed frames describing the particular word senses,t*\u2019 or (b) global statistics about the word occurrences.3 The first has not yet been made available in any real application, and the second may give the wrong answer in specific local instances. This procedure uses available dictionaries, so that it will process any text; and uses solely the immediate context. To consider the example in the title, look at the definition of pine in the Oxford Advanced Learner\u2019s Dictionary of Current English: there are, of course, two major senses. \u201ckind of evergreen tree with needle-shaped leaves.. .\u201d and \u201cwaste away through sorrow or illness...\u201d And cone has three separate definitions: \u201csolid body which narrows to a\u2019 point . . . . *\u2019 \u201csomething of this shape w-hether solid or hollow...,\u201d and \u201cfruit of certain evergreen trees...\u201d Note that both evergreen and tree are common to two of the sense definitions: thus a program could guess that if the two words pine cone appear together, the likely senses are those of the tree and its fruit"

The method is based on the availability of pairs of large corresponding texts that are translations of each other. In our case, the texts are in English and French.Fundamental to the technique is a complex glossary of correspondence of fixed locutions. The steps of the proposed translation process are: (1) Partition the source text into a set of fixed locutions. (2) Use the glossary plus contextual information to select the corresponding set of fixed locutions into a sequence forming the target sentence. (3) Arrange the words of the target fixed locutions into a sequence forming the target sentence.We have developed statistical techniques facilitating both the automatic creation of the glossary, and the performance of the three translation steps, all on the basis of an alignment of corresponding sentences in the two texts.While we are not yet able to provide examples of French / English translation, we present some encouraging intermediate results concerning glossary creation and the arrangement of target word sequences."

A simple triclass Markov model is used, and the best way to estimate the parameters of this model, depending on the kind and amount of training data that is provided, is found. Two approaches are compared: the use of text that has been tagged by hand and comparing relative frequency counts; and use text without tags and training the model as a hidden Markov process, according to a maximum likelihood principle. Experiments show that the best training is obtained by using as much tagged text as is available, a maximum likelihood training may improve the accuracy of the tagging.<<ETX>>"

Specifically, the problem is to estimate the probability that a given word will be the next word uttered. Algorithms are presented for automatically constructing a binary decision tree designed to estimate these probabilities. At each node of the tree there is a yes/no question relating to the words already spoken, and at each leaf there is a probability distribution over the allowable vocabulary. Ideally, these nodal questions can take the form of arbitrarily complex Boolean expressions, but computationally cheaper alternatives are also discussed. Some results obtained on a 5000-word vocabulary with a tree designed to predict the next word spoken from the preceding 20 words are included. The tree is compared to an equivalent trigram model and shown to be superior. >"
