Maximum likelihood estimation is done via Boltzmann learning in one-dimensional networks with tied weights. We call these networks Boltzmann chains and show that they contain hidden Markov models (HMMs) as a special case. Our framework also motivates new architectures that address particular shortcomings of HMMs. We look at two such architectures: parallel chains that model feature sets with disparate time scales, and looped networks that model long-term dependencies between hidden states. For these networks, we show how to implement the Boltzmann learning rule exactly, in polynomial time, without resort to simulated or mean-field annealing. The necessary computations are done by exact decimation procedures from statistical mechanics."

The methods display certain novel aspects geared specifically towards the efficient analysis of lattice heteropolymer models at low temperatures. However, the general principles are in fact extremely general in scope, and can be applied also to problems at arbitrary temperatures, to homopolymers and RNA molecules, to sequence analysis issues such as inverse folding and sequence alignment, and to other discrete global optimization problems. Special importance is laid upon the need to measure in detail the structural characteristics of as large a number as possible of the low-energy states of heteropolymer models in order to understand their folding properties, as opposed to simply locating the slate of globally minimal energy (or locally minimal energy). In this way fundamental questions concerning the relevance of thermodynamic barriers in the models can be addressed.<<ETX>>"

The reasons this method has become so popular are the inherent statistical (mathematically precise) framework; the ease and availability of training algorithms for cstimating the parameters of the models from finite training sets of speech data; the flexibility of the resulting recognition system in which one can easily change the size, type, or architecture of the models to suit particular words, sounds, and so forth; and the ease of implementation of the overall recognition system. In this expository article, we address the role of statistical methods in this powerful technology as applied to speech recognition and discuss a range of theoretical and practical issues that are as yet unsolved in terms of their importance and their effect on performance for different system implementations."
