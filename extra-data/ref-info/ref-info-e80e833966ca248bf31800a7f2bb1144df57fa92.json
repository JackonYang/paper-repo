Of 561 cells from which responses were recorded, 40 responded preferentially to faces. Different categories of these cells were influenced by dominance (presumably indicated by the presence and size of horns), breed and familiarity, and threatening faces such as those of humans and dogs. These results demonstrate that cells that respond preferentially to faces are present in the temporal cortex of a nonprimate species, and that the responses of these cells are influenced by factors relevant to social interaction."

We found a functional organization of cells responsive to the sight of different views of the head. Cells of a similar type were grouped together both vertically down through the cortex, and horizontally in patches extending 0.5-2.0 mm across the surface of the cortex. A substantial proportion of cells responsive to faces were found to be sensitive to biologically important characteristics such as identity or expression. Cells were found to be highly selective for particular individuals that were familiar to the monkey with selectivity persisting across a great variety of viewing conditions such as changing face expression, orientation, colour, distance and size. Data suggested that sensitivity to identity arises at the level of specific views of the individual (e.g. full face). Information about different views may then be pooled to allow recognition independent of view. Visual transformations that make it difficult for humans to perceive faces (e.g., contrast reversal, isoluminant colour, coarsely quantized images, rotation or inversion) reduced the magnitude or increased the latency of cells' responses to faces. In this way, cell responses were related to perception and not simply to visual qualities of the image."

It is now clear that the retina and visual pathways do not simply transmit a mosaic of Iight and dark to some central sensorium. Rather, even at the retinal level, specific features of visual stimuli are detected and their presence communicated to the next level. In cats and monkeys, the geniculostriate visual system consists of a series of converging and diverging connections such that at each successive tier of processing mechanism, single neurons respond to increasingly more specific visual stimuli falling on an increasingly wider area of the retina (19-Z). How far does this analytical-synthetic process continue whereby individual cells have more and more specific trigger features? Are there regions of the brain beyond striate and prestriatel cortex where this processing of visual information is carrie,d further? If so, how far and in what way? Are there cells that are concerned with the storage of visual information as well as its analysis? There are several lines of evidence suggesting that a possible site for further processing of visual information and perhaps even for storage of such information might, in the monkey, be inferotemporal cortexthe cortex on the inferior convexity of the temporal lobe. First, this area receives afferents from prestriate cortex which itself processes visual information received from"

These neurons are relatively rare in the inferior temporal visual cortex, area TE, but are more common in the cortex in the middle and anterior parts of the superior temporal sulcus. In some cases these neurons can respond to parts of faces such as the eyes, and in other cases a fuller complement of the features present in faces, with even the correct configuration of these features, appears to be necessary for these neurons to respond. In experiments to investigate whether the responses of these neurons would be useful for recognition of an individual, it has been shown that in many cases (77% of one sample), these neurons are sensitive to differences between faces. In experiments designed to investigate the information required for these neurons to respond, it has been shown that these neurons can respond to blurred images of faces, and to faces with only the high spatial frequencies included. A population of neurons with face-selective responses has also been found in the amygdala, which receives inputs from the temporal lobe visual cortex. In many cases these neurons respond differently to different faces. It is suggested that the importance of this type of neuron may be in the different emotional and social responses which occur to different faces, and which are disrupted by damage to the amygdala."

The \u201cambiguity\u201d of the stimulus (the frequency with which different members of a group are visually similar) is an adjuvant factor. But prosopagnosia is not specific to human faces.

We recorded from single neurons in the dorsal bank and fundus of the anterior portion of the superior temporal sulcus, an area we term the superior temporal polysensory area (STP). Five macaques were studied under anesthesia ( N20) and immobilization in repeated recording sessions. 2. Almost all of the neurons were visually responsive, and over half responded to more than one sensory modality; 21% responded to visual and auditory stimuli, 17% responded to visual and somesthetic stimuli, 17% were trimodal, and 41% were exclusively visual. 3. Almost all the visual receptive fields extended into both visual half-fields, and the majority approached the size of the visual field of the monkey, including both monocular crescents. Somesthetic receptive fields were also bilateral and usually included most of the body surface. 4. Virtually all neurons responded better to moving visual stimuli than to stationary visual stimuli, and almost half were sensitive to the direction of movement. Several classes of directional neurons were found, including a) neurons selective for a single direction of movement throughout their receptive field, b) neurons selective for directions of movement radially symmetric about the center of gaze, and c) neurons selective for movement in depth. 5. The majority of neurons (70%) had little or no preference for stimulus size, shape, orientation, or contrast. The minority (30%) responded best to particular stimuli. Some of these appeared to be selective for faces. 6. The properties of most STP neurons, such as large receptive fields, sensitivity to movement, insensitivity to form, and polymodal responsiveness, suggest that STP is more involved in orientation and spatial functions than in pattern recognition."

Two generations later, the behaviorist movement, motivated partly by the excesses of introspective psychology and partly by imitation of operationalism in physics, succeeded in exorcizing both the language of conscious experience and the study of consciousness and mental states. Ever since, the dominant trend in studies of learning, including the neuro\u00ad physiology of learning, has followed a strict behaviorist line. Reductionist ap\u00ad proaches, such as the measurement of habit strengths and response rates and the tracing of neural circuits, have led to the accumulation of a vast amount of empirical knowledge but little insight into basic mechanisms. Sensory neurophysiology has followed a similar philosophical and methodological program, culminating for some in the extreme position that entire percepts may be represented by the firing of one or a few neurons (3, 69), or that higher order perceptual and cognitive functions are represented in localized anatomical regions. However, the study of how univariate sensory features, or stimulus attributes, differentially affect various anatomical structures ignores the problem of how the organism constructs an integrated, mul\u00ad tivariate, and multidimensional perception of its environment."

                "text": "Studies aimed at characterizing the operation of cognitive functions in normal individuals have examined data from patients with focal cerebral insult. These studies assume that brain damage impairs functions of the cognitive processes along lines that honour the \u2018normal\u2019 pre-morbid organization of the cognitive system1. For example, detailed study of individual brain-damaged patients has revealed apparently selective disruption of cognitive functions such as auditory/verbal working memory2, phonological processing ability3, grapheme-to-phoneme translation procedures4and semantic processing5. Warrington et al. have studied patients with even more fine-grained selective disturbances of the semantic system6,7. The most selective deficits have been reported for four patients who were significantly better at identifying inanimate objects than they were at identifying living things and foods8. These patterns of selective deficit after localized brain damage provide important information about the normal organization of the lexicon, and ultimately about how components of the lexical system are related to particular neural substrates. Here, we report a case study of a patient demonstrating a very selective disturbance of the ability to name items from two related semantic categories. Despite normal performance on a large battery of lexical/semantic tasks, the patient shows a consistent and striking disability in naming members of the semantic categories of \u2018fruits\u2019 and \u2018vegetables\u2019. The selectivity of this deficit supports a category-specific organization of the mental lexicon, and suggests independence of the processing routes involving naming and name recognition."

And there is a third reason why it has given me much pleasure, for Sir Frederick Bartlett was one of those who had an important influence on the direction of my career some 40 years ago. I had to decide whether to spend my last year at Cambridge reading psychology or physiology, so I attended a short course of introductory lectures he gave in July. About half a dozen of us sat on upright wooden chairs circled around him as he sat in an armchair, smiling benignly. The first thing he did was to tell us to close our notebooks, for he was not going to say anything that would help us to pass any exams. And I believe the very last words of his last lecture were, \u201cSo you see it is all very difficult\u201d. I was very glad he said that, for I had in fact found it all very heavy going: my brain seemed always to be lost in clouds of uncertainty when \u201cremembering\u201d, \u201cthinking\u201d, or \u201cperceiving\u201d were mentioned, because there was no conceptual framework for these processes except the words themselves and others spun around them. What I was looking for were the definable quantities of physics, chemistry and even physiology, these I could handle conceptually in their geometric and functional interactions, whereas I always find a purely verbal argument about abstractions difficult to follow and impossible to believe. So this lack of any nonverbal conceptual framework was very painful."

The model consists of a large number of simple processing elements which send excitatory and inhibitory signals to each other via modifiable connections. Information processing is thought of as the process whereby patterns of activation are formed over the units in the model through their excitatory and inhibitory interactions. The memory trace of a processing event is the change or increment to the strengths of the interconnections that results from the processing event. The traces of separate events are superimposed on each other in the values of the connection strengths that result from the entire set of traces stored in the memory. The model is applied to a number of findings related to the question of whether we store abstract representations or an enumeration of specific experiences in memory. The model simulates the results of a number of important experiments which have been taken as evidence for the enumeration of specific experiences. At the same time, it shows how the functional equivalent of abstract representations--prototypes, logogens, and even rules--can emerge from the superposition of traces of specific experiences, when the conditions are right for this to happen. In essence, the model captures the structure present in a set of input patterns; thus, it behaves as though it had learned prototypes or rules, to the extent that the structure of the environment it has learned about can be captured by describing it in terms of these abstractions."
