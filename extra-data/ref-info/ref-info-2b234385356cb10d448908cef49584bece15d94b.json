The application is hand-printed character recognition. Two versions of the system are described. One uses a backpropagation network that scans exhaustively over a field of characters and is trained to recognize whether it is centered over a single character or between characters. When it is centered over a character, the net classifies the character. The approach is tested on a dataset of hand-printed digits. Very low error rates are reported. The second version, COISR-SACCADE, avoids the need for exhaustive scans. The net is trained as before, but also is trained to compute ballistic 'eye' movements that enable the input window to jump from one character to the next."

However, their recognition accuracy has been limited by the accuracy of the underlying segmentation algorithm. Conventional, rule-based segmentation algorithms encounter difficulty if the characters are touching, broken, or noisy. The problem in these situations is that often one cannot properly segment a character until it is recognized yet one cannot properly recognize a character until it is segmented. We present here a neural network algorithm that simultaneously segments and recognizes in an integrated system. This algorithm has several novel features: it uses a supervised learning algorithm (backpropagation), but is able to take position-independent information as targets and self-organize the activities of the units in a competitive fashion to infer the positional information. We demonstrate this ability with overlapping handprinted numerals."
