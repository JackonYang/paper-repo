The methods in this paper lead to a unified treatment of some of Valiant's results, along with previous results on distribution-free convergence of certain pattern recognition algorithms. It is shown that the essential condition for distribution-free learnability is finiteness of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, a simple combinatorial parameter of the class of concepts to be learned. Using this parameter, the complexity and closure properties of learnable classes are analyzed, and the necessary and sufficient conditions are provided for feasible learnability."

In this paper we regard learning as the phenomenon of knowledge acquisition in the absence of explicit programming. We give a precise methodology for studying this phenomenon from a computational viewpoint. It consists of choosing an appropriate information gathering mechanism, the learning protocol, and exploring the class of concepts that can be learnt using it in a reasonable (polynomial) number of steps. We find that inherent algorithmic complexity appears to set serious limits to the range of concepts that can be so learnt. The methodology and results suggest concrete principles for designing realistic learning systems."

It has been shown that the existence of an Occam algorithm for a class of concepts is a sufficient condition for the PAC-learnability of that class (Blumer 1987, 1989). (An Occam algorithm is a randomized polynomial-time algorithm that, when given as input a sample of strings of some unknown concept to be learned, outputs a small description of a concept that is consistent with the sample.) In this paper it is shown for many natural concept classes that the PAC-learnability of the class implies the existence of an Occam algorithm for the class. More generally, the property of closure under exception lists is defined, and it is shown that for any concept class with this property, PAC-learnability of the class is equivalent to the existence of an Occam algorithm for the class. An interpretation of these results is that for many classes, PAC-learnability is equivalent to data compression."

Functions on strings of a finite alphabet are considered and the notion of dimensionality defined for families of such functions. Using this notion, a theorem is proved identifying the most general conditions under which a family of functions can be efficiently learned from examples. Turning to some familiar families, we present strong evidence against the existence of efficient algorithms for learning the regular functions and the polynomial time computable functions, even if the size of the encoding of the function to be learned is given. Our arguments hinge in a new complexity measure--the constraint complexity."

Positive results are shown for significant subclasses that allow not only propositional predicates but also some relations. The algorithms are extended so as to be provably tolerant to a certain quantifiable error rate in the examples data. It is further shown that under certain restrictions on these subclasses the learning algorithms are well suited to implementation on neural networks of threshold elements. The possible importance of disjunctions of conjunctions as a knowledge representation stems from the observations that on the one hand humans appear to like using it andon the other, that there is circumstantial evidence that significantly larger classes may not be learnable in polynomial time. An NP-completeness result corroborating the latter is also presented."

Their model is related to L.G. Valiant's learnability model (1984), but does not require the hypotheses used for prediction to be represented in any specified form. The authors first disregard computational complexity and show how to construct prediction strategies that are optimal to within a constant factor for any reasonable class F of target functions. These prediction strategies use the 1-inclusion graph structure from N. Alon et al.'s work on geometric range queries (1987) to minimize the probability of incorrect prediction. They then turn to computationally efficient algorithms. For indicator functions of axis-parallel rectangles and halfspaces in R/sup n/, they demonstrate how their techniques can be applied to construct computational efficient prediction strategies that are optimal to within a constant factor. They compare the general performance of prediction strategies derived by their method to those derived from existing methods in Valiant's learnability theory.<<ETX>>"

The particular problems we consider are: finding Hamiltonian circuits in directed graphs (DHC), finding Hamiltonian circuits in undirected graphs (UHC), and finding perfect matchings in undirected graphs (PM). We show that for each problem there is an algorithm that is extremely fast (0(n(log n)2) for DHC and UHC, and 0(nlog n) for PM), and which with probability tending to one finds a solution in randomly chosen graphs of sufficient density. These results contrast with the known NP-completeness of the first two problems [2,12] and the best worst-case upper bound known of 0(n2.5) for the last [9]."
