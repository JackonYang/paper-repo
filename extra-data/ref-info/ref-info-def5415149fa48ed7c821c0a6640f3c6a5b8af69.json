In this approach, block-grammars are recursively applied until a page is classified into its most significant sub-blocks. While a grammar devised for each block depends on its logical function, it is possible to formulate a generic description for all block grammars using attribute grammars. This attribute grammar formulation forms a generic framework on which this syntactic approach is based, while the attributes themselves are derived from publication-specific knowledge. The attribute extraction process and the formulation itself are covered in this paper. We discuss an application of attribute grammars to a document analysis problem, the extraction of logical, relational information from the image of tables."

                "text": "Grammars are a powerful technique for modeling and extracting the structure of documents. One large challenge, however, is computational complexity. The computational cost of grammatical parsing is related to both the complexity of the input and the ambiguity of the grammar. For programming languages, where the terminals appear in a linear sequence and the grammar is unambiguous, parsing is O(N). For natural languages, which are linear yet have an ambiguous grammar, parsing is O(N/sup 3/). For documents, where the terminals are arranged in two dimensions and the grammar is ambiguous, parsing time can be exponential in the number of terminals. In this paper we introduce (and unify) several types of geometrical data structures which can be used to significantly accelerate parsing time. Each data structure embodies a different geometrical constraint on the set of possible valid parses. These data structures are very general, in that they can be used by any type of grammatical model, and a wide variety of document understanding tasks, to limit the set of hypotheses examined and tested. Assuming a clean design for the parsing software, the same parsing framework can be tested with various geometric constraints to determine the most effective combination."

Our formulation uses a factorization analogous to the standard dynamic programs for parsing. In particular, it allows one to efficiently learn a model which discriminates among the entire space of parse trees, as opposed to reranking the top few candidates. Our models can condition on arbitrary features of input sentences, thus incorporating an important kind of lexical information without the added algorithmic complexity of modeling headedness. We provide an efficient algorithm for learning such models and show experimental evidence of the model\u2019s improved performance over a natural baseline model and a lexicalized probabilistic context-free grammar."

These steps describe the conversion of the physical structure of a document into its logical structure. We have developed a computational model for document logical structure derivation, in which a rule-based control strategy utilizes the data obtained from analyzing a digitized document image, and makes inferences using a multi-level knowledge base of document layout rules. The knowledge-based document logical structure derivation system (DeLoS) based on this model consists of a hierarchical rule-based control system to guide the block classification, grouping and read-ordering operations; a global data structure to store the document image data and incremental inferences; and a domain knowledge base to encode the rules governing document layout."

The value of the approach is demonstrated in a system that recognizes printed, noisy equations. The system uses a two-dimensional probabilistic version of the Cocke-Younger-Kasami parsing algorithm to find the most likely parse of the observed image, and then traverses the corresponding parse tree in accordance with translation formats associated with each production rule, to produce eqn I troff commands for the imaged equation. In addition, it uses two-dimensional versions of the Inside/Outside and Baum re-estimation algorithms for learning the parameters of the grammar from a training set of examples. Parsing the image of a simple noisy equation currently takes about one second of cpu time on an Alliant FX/80."

The use of A* search can dramatically reduce the time required to find a best parse by conservatively estimating the probabilities of parse completions. We discuss various estimates and give efficient algorithms for computing them. On average-length Penn treebank sentences, our most detailed estimate reduces the total number of edges processed to less than 3% of that required by exhaustive parsing, and a simpler estimate, which requires less than a minute of pre-computation, reduces the work to less than 5%. Un-like best-first and finite-beam methods for achieving this kind of speed-up, an A* method is guaranteed to find the most likely parse, not just an approximation. Our parser, which is simpler to implement than an upward-propagating best-first parser, is correct for a wide range of parser control strategies and maintains worst-case cubic time."

The TR algorithm, inspired by turbo decoding, is based on a generative model of image production, in which two grammars are used simultaneously to describe structure in orthogonal (horizontal and vertical directions. This enables TR to strictly embody non-local constraints that cannot be taken into account by local statistical methods. This basis in finite state grammars also allows TR to be quickly retargetable to new domains. We illustrate some of the capabilities of TR with two examples involving realistic images. While TR, like turbo decoding, is not guaranteed to recover the statistically optimal solution, we present an experiment that demonstrates its ability to produce optimal or near-optimal results on a simple yet nontrivial example, the recovery of a filled rectangle in the midst of noise. Unlike methods such as stochastic context free grammars and exhaustive search, which are often intractable beyond small images, turbo recognition scales linearly with image size, suggesting TR as an efficient yet near-optimal approach to statistical layout analysis."

While in prose significant constraints can be put on the interpretation of a character by the characters immediately preceding and following it, few such simple constraints are present in a mathematical expression. In order to make the problem tractable, effective methods of recognizing mathematical expressions will need to put intelligent constraints on the possible interpretations. The authors present preliminary results on a system for the recognition of both handwritten and typeset mathematical expressions. While previous systems perform character recognition out of context, the current system maintains ambiguity of the characters until context can be used to disambiguate the interpretation. In addition, the system limits the number of potentially valid interpretations by decomposing the expressions into a sequence of compatible convex regions. The system uses A-star to search for the best possible interpretation of an expression. We provide a new lower bound estimate on the cost to goal that improves performance significantly."

The first is compiler-style use of trees and tree transformation. The second is a multi-pass control structure, with a clear separation between layout, lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis. Our proposal is illustrated on a case study involving recognition of hand-drawn mathematics notation."

The diversity of approaches to the problem and the lack of a commercially viable system, however, indicate that there is still much research to be done in this area. In this thesis, I will describe an on-line approach for converting a handwritten mathematical expression into an equivalent expression in a typesetting command language such as TEX or MathML, as well as a feedback-oriented user interface which can make errors more tolerable to the end user since they can be quickly corrected. The three primary components of this system are a method for classifying isolated handwritten symbols, an algorithm for partitioning an expression into symbols, and an algorithm for converting a two-dimensional arrangements of symbols into a typeset expression. For symbol classification, a Gaussian classifier is used to rank order the interpretations of a set of strokes as a single symbol. To partition an expression, the values generated by the symbol classifier are used to perform a constrained search of possible partitions for the one with the minimum summed cost. Finally, the expression is parsed using a simple geometric grammar. Thesis Supervisor: Paul A. Viola Title: Associate Professor"

This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \"integral image\" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a \"cascade\" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection."

The model we study can be interpreted as a broad, abstract extension of the well-studied on-line prediction model to a general decision-theoretic setting. We show that the multiplicative weight-update Littlestone?Warmuth rule can be adapted to this model, yielding bounds that are slightly weaker in some cases, but applicable to a considerably more general class of learning problems. We show how the resulting learning algorithm can be applied to a variety of problems, including gambling, multiple-outcome prediction, repeated games, and prediction of points in Rn. In the second part of the paper we apply the multiplicative weight-update technique to derive a new boosting algorithm. This boosting algorithm does not require any prior knowledge about the performance of the weak learning algorithm. We also study generalizations of the new boosting algorithm to the problem of learning functions whose range, rather than being binary, is an arbitrary finite set or a bounded segment of the real line."
