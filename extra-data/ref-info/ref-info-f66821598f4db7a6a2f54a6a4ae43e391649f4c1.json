Motivated by the problem of automatically constructing and extending such taxonomies, in this paper we present a new algorithm for automatically learning hypernym (is-a) relations from text. Our method generalizes earlier work that had relied on using small numbers of hand-crafted regular expression patterns to identify hypernym pairs. Using \"dependency path\" features extracted from parse trees, we introduce a general-purpose formalization and generalization of these patterns. Given a training set of text containing known hypernym pairs, our algorithm automatically extracts useful dependency paths and applies them to new corpora to identify novel pairs. On our evaluation task (determining whether two nouns in a news article participate in a hypernym relationship), our automatically extracted database of hypernyms attains both higher precision and higher recall than WordNet."

                "text": "Traditionally, Information Extraction (IE) has focused on satisfying precise, narrow, pre-specified requests from small homogeneous corpora (e.g., extract the location and time of seminars from a set of announcements). Shifting to a new domain requires the user to name the target relations and to manually create new extraction rules or hand-tag new training examples. This manual labor scales linearly with the number of target relations. This paper introduces Open IE (OIE), a new extraction paradigm where the system makes a single data-driven pass over its corpus and extracts a large set of relational tuples without requiring any human input. The paper also introduces TEXTRUNNER, a fully implemented, highly scalable OIE system where the tuples are assigned a probability and indexed to support efficient extraction and exploration via user queries. We report on experiments over a 9,000,000 Web page corpus that compare TEXTRUNNER with KNOWITALL, a state-of-the-art Web IE system. TEXTRUNNER achieves an error reduction of 33% on a comparable set of extractions. Furthermore, in the amount of time it takes KNOWITALL to perform extraction for a handful of pre-specified relations, TEXTRUNNER extracts a far broader set of facts reflecting orders of magnitude more relations, discovered on the fly. We report statistics on TEXTRUNNER\u2019s 11,000,000 highest probability tuples, and show that they contain over 1,000,000 concrete facts and over 6,500,000more abstract assertions."

While humans appear to use inference rules such as \u2018X writes Y\u2019 implies \u2018X is the author of Y\u2019 in answering questions, such rules are generally unavailable to question-answering systems due to the inherent difficulty in constructing them. In this paper, we present an unsupervised algorithm for discovering inference rules from text. Our algorithm is based on an extended version of Harris\u2019 Distributional Hypothesis, which states that words that occurred in the same contexts tend to be similar. Instead of using this hypothesis on words, we apply it to paths in the dependency trees of a parsed corpus. Essentially, if two paths tend to link the same set of words, we hypothesize that their meanings are similar. We use examples to show that our system discovers many inference rules easily missed by humans."

A sequence of words is in the language of a link grammar if there is a way to draw links between words in such a way that (1) the local requirements of each word are satisfied, (2) the links do not cross, and (3) the words form a connected graph. We have encoded English grammar into such a system, and written a program (based on new algorithms) for efficiently parsing with a link grammar. The formalism is lexical and makes no explicit use of constituents and categories. The breadth of English phenomena that our system handles is quite large. A number of sophisticated and new techniques were used to allow efficient parsing of this very complex grammar. Our program is written in C, and the entire system may be obtained via anonymous ftp. Several other researchers have begun to use link grammars in their own research."

However, in most cases these evaluations take the parsers independently (intrinsic evaluations), and only in a few cases has the effect of different parsers in real applications been measured (extrinsic evaluations). This paper compares two evaluations of the Link Grammar parser and the Conexor Functional Dependency Grammar parser. The parsing systems, despite both being dependency-based, return different types of dependencies, making a direct comparison impossible. In the intrinsic evaluation, the accuracy of the parsers is compared independently by converting the dependencies into grammatical relations and using the methodology of Carroll et al. (1998) for parser comparison. In the extrinsic evaluation, the parsers' impact in a practical application is compared within the context of answer extraction. The differences in the results are significant."

Dependency grammar analysis is evaluated for boosting the rank of passages where complementary subject/object concept pairs can be identified between queries and sentences from candidate passages. In our model, a concept is represented as a set of synonymous terms and a concept-word distribution. Concept terms are identified using an information extraction technique relying on shallow sentence parsing, external knowledge sources, and document context. The system combines a dimensional data model for indexing scientific literature at multiple levels of document context, with a rule-based query processing algorithm. The data model consists of two hierarchical indices: one for individual words and a second for extracted concepts. The word index provides retrieval of single or multi-word terms. The concept index provides efficient retrieval of single or multiple independent concepts. A retrieval function combines concepts with term statistics at multiple levels of context to identify relevant passages. Finally, we boost the relevance score of sentences identified within a passage where we can identify term dependencies that complement subject/object pairs between query and passage sentences via dependency grammar analysis. Our objective for this year\u2019s forum was to improve passage retrieval precision. We submitted three automatically generated results for three variations of our retrieval model to the TREC forum. The three results exceeded the track median for character based passage retrieval by 75 to 93%. The mean average precision (MAP) for our top passage retrieval model was 0.0940 which compares favorably to the top result of 0.0976."

We begin by observing that the Penn Treebank (PTB) is lexically impoverished when measured on various genres of scientific and technical writing, and that this significantly impacts parse accuracy. To resolve this without requiring in-domain treebank data, we show how existing domain-specific lexical resources may be leveraged to augment PTB-training: part-of-speech tags, dictionary collocations, and named-entities. Using a state-of-the-art statistical parser [3] as our baseline, our lexically-adapted parser achieves a 14.2% reduction in error. With oracle-knowledge of named-entities, this error reduction improves to 21.2%."

We use an algorithm based on loglinear classifiers to augment and reshape context-free trees so as to reintroduce underlying nonlocal dependencies lost in the context-free approximation. We find that our algorithm compares favorably with prior work on English using an existing evaluation metric, and also introduce and argue for a new dependency-based evaluation metric. By this new evaluation metric our algorithm achieves 60% error reduction on gold-standard input trees and 5% error reduction on state-of-the-art machine-parsed input trees, when compared with the best previous work. We also present the first results on non-local dependency reconstruction for a language other than English, comparing performance on English and German. Our new evaluation metric quantitatively corroborates the intuition that in a language with freer word order, the surface dependencies in context-free parse trees are a poorer approximation to underlying dependency structure."

This methodology particularly targets the e-learning and AIED (artificial intelligence in education) communities as they need such structures to sustain the production of e-learning resources tailored to learners' needs. This paper details the steps to transform textual resources, particularly textual learning objects (LOs), into domain concept maps and it explains how this abstract structure is transformed into a formal domain ontology. A methodology is also presented to evaluate the results of ontology learning. The paper shows how such structures (domain concept maps and formal ontologies) make it possible to bridge the gap between eLearning and intelligent tutoring systems by providing a common domain model."

In creating this year's dataset, a number of longer texts were introduced to make the challenge more oriented to realistic scenarios. Additionally, a pool of resources was offered so that the participants could share common tools. A pilot task was also set up, aimed at differentiating unknown entailments from identified contradictions and providing justifications for overall system decisions. 26 participants submitted 44 runs, using different approaches and generally presenting new entailment models and achieving higher scores than in the previous challenges."

The development and evaluation of such methods requires annotated domain corpora.ResultsWe present BioInfer (Bio Information Extraction Resource), a new public resource providing an annotated corpus of biomedical English. We describe an annotation scheme capturing named entities and their relationships along with a dependency analysis of sentence syntax. We further present ontologies defining the types of entities and relationships annotated in the corpus. Currently, the corpus contains 1100 sentences from abstracts of biomedical research articles annotated for relationships, named entities, as well as syntactic dependencies. Supporting software is provided with the corpus. The corpus is unique in the domain in combining these annotation types for a single set of sentences, and in the level of detail of the relationship annotation.ConclusionWe introduce a corpus targeted at protein, gene, and RNA relationships which serves as a resource for the development of information extraction systems and their components such as parsers and domain analyzers. The corpus will be maintained and further developed with a current version being available at http://www.it.utu.fi/BioInfer."

Indeed, its performance of 86.36% (LP/LR F1) is better than that of early lexicalized PCFG models, and surprisingly close to the current state-of-the-art. This result has potential uses beyond establishing a strong lower bound on the maximum possible accuracy of unlexicalized models: an unlexicalized PCFG is much more compact, easier to replicate, and easier to interpret than more complex lexical models, and the parsing algorithms are simpler, more widely understood, of lower asymptotic complexity, and easier to optimize."

It is based on natural language preprocessing producing dependency parse trees and applying a small number of simple rules to these trees. We applied RelEx on a comprehensive set of one million MEDLINE abstracts dealing with gene and protein relations and extracted approximately 150,000 relations with an estimated performance of both 80% precision and 80% recall.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nThe used natural language preprocessing tools are free for use for academic research.

Our approach is based on the analysis of the paths between two protein names in the dependency parse trees of the sentences. Given two dependency trees, we define two separate similarity functions (kernels) based on cosine similarity and edit distance among the paths between the protein names. Using these similarity functions, we investigate the performances of two classes of learning algorithms, Support Vector Machines and k-nearest-neighbor, and the semisupervised counterparts of these algorithms, transductive SVMs and harmonic functions, respectively. Significant improvement over the previous results in the literature is reported as well as a new benchmark dataset is introduced. Semi-supervised algorithms perform better than their supervised version by a wide margin especially when the amount of labeled data is limited."

In contrast to earlier approaches to PPI extraction, the introduced all-dependency-paths kernel has the capability to consider full, general dependency graphs. We evaluate the proposed method across five publicly available PPI corpora providing the most comprehensive evaluation done for a machine learning based PPI-extraction system. Our method is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance with respect to comparable evaluations, achieving 56.4 F-score and 84.8 AUC on the AImed corpus. Further, we identify several pitfalls that can make evaluations of PPI-extraction systems incomparable, or even invalid. These include incorrect cross-validation strategies and problems related to comparing F-score results achieved on different evaluation resources."

Different from traditional text summarization, review mining and summarization aims at extracting the features on which the reviewers express their opinions and determining whether the opinions are positive or negative. In this paper, we focus on a specific domain - movie review. A multi-knowledge based approach is proposed, which integrates WordNet, statistical analysis and movie knowledge.

                "text": "BackgroundInterest is growing in the application of syntactic parsers to natural language processing problems in biology, but assessing their performance is difficult because differences in linguistic convention can falsely appear to be errors. We present a method for evaluating their accuracy using an intermediate representation based on dependency graphs, in which the semantic relationships important in most information extraction tasks are closer to the surface. We also demonstrate how this method can be easily tailored to various application-driven criteria.ResultsUsing the GENIA corpus as a gold standard, we tested four open-source parsers which have been used in bioinformatics projects. We first present overall performance measures, and test the two leading tools, the Charniak-Lease and Bikel parsers, on subtasks tailored to reflect the requirements of a system for extracting gene expression relationships. These two tools clearly outperform the other parsers in the evaluation, and achieve accuracy levels comparable to or exceeding native dependency parsers on similar tasks in previous biological evaluations.ConclusionEvaluating using dependency graphs allows parsers to be tested easily on criteria chosen according to the semantics of particular biological applications, drawing attention to important mistakes and soaking up many insignificant differences that would otherwise be reported as errors. Generating high-accuracy dependency graphs from the output of phrase-structure parsers also provides access to the more detailed syntax trees that are used in several natural-language processing techniques."
