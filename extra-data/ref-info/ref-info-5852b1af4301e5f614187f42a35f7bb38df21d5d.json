In this paper, we consider the problem of table detection in web documents. Its potential applications include web mining, knowledge management, and web content summarization and delivery to narrow-bandwidth devices. We describe a machine learning based approach to classify each given table entity as either genuine or non-genuine. Various features reflecting the layout as well as content characteristics of tables are studied.In order to facilitate the training and evaluation of our table classifier, we designed a novel web document table ground truthing protocol and used it to build a large table ground truth database. The database consists of 1,393 HTML files collected from hundreds of different web sites and contains 11,477 leaf TABLE elements, out of which 1,740 are genuine tables. Experiments were conducted using the cross validation method and an F-measure of 95.89% was achieved."

At the same time, it utilizes the characteristics of HTML and the techniques of natural language processing to design some heuristic rules, and thus aids the identification of table items. On the above basis, we design a prototype, \"EXTable\", and then gain a better result according to experimentation."

These information retrieval systems merely show html pages that include the index word abstracted from the user's query. There are a number of difficulties to be overcome in the present technology which could be solved by considering semantics in html documents. However it can heighten the precision of retrieval results by using the structural information of the document as an alternative source of information. The tabular form, which appears on ordinary documents, usually has the most relevant information. Based on the similarity to a Web's html document, we try to improve the precision of results by analyzing the table on html documents. Our main purpose here is to do table parsing and construct a dictionary of table indexes for applying to our information retrieval system and thus enhance the accuracy."
