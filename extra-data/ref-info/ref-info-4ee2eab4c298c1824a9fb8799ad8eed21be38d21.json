Current statistical techniques uncover translation rules from bilingual training texts and use those rules to translate new texts. The general architecture is the source-channel model: an English string is statistically generated (source), then statistically transformed into French (channel). In order to translate (or \"decode\") a French string, we look for the most likely English source. We show that for the simplest form of statistical models, this problem is NP-complete, i.e., probably exponential in the length of the observed sentence. We trace this complexity to factors not present in other decoding problems."

A general problem of this approach is that there is only a loose relation to the final translation quality on unseen text. In this paper, we analyze various training criteria which directly optimize translation quality. These training criteria make use of recently proposed automatic evaluation metrics. We describe a new algorithm for efficient training an unsmoothed error count. We show that significantly better results can often be obtained if the final evaluation criterion is taken directly into account as part of the training procedure."

The first step of the method is to parse the source language string that is being translated. The second step is to apply a series of transformations to the parse tree, effectively reordering the surface string on the source language side of the translation system. The goal of this step is to recover an underlying word order that is closer to the target language word-order than the original string. The reordering approach is applied as a pre-processing step in both the training and decoding phases of a phrase-based statistical MT system. We describe experiments on translation from German to English, showing an improvement from 25.2% Bleu score for a baseline system to 26.8% Bleu score for the system with reordering, a statistically significant improvement."

However, a new language modeling technique, Factored Language Models can incorporate the additional linguistic information that is produced by these tools. In the field of automatic speech recognition, Factored Language Models smoothed with Generalized Parallel Backoff have been shown to significantly reduce language model perplexity. However, Factored Language Models have previously only been applied to statistical machine translation as part of a second-pass rescoring system. In this thesis, we show that a state-of-the-art phrase-based system using factored language models with generalized parallel backoff can improve performance over an identical system using trigram language models. These improvements can be seen both with the use of additional word features and without. The relative gain from the Factored Language Models increases with smaller training corpora, making this approach especially useful for domains with limited data."

In addition to the standard source-channel approach to statistical machine translation, a more general approach based on the maximum entropy principle is presented. Various methods for computing single-word alignments using statistical or heuristic models are described. Various smoothing techniques, methods to integrate a conventional dictionary and training methods are analyzed. A detailed evaluation of these models is performed by comparing the automatically produced word alignment with a manually produced reference alignment. Based on these fundamental single-word based alignment models, a new phrase-based translation model\u2014the alignment template model\u2014is suggested. For this model, a training and an efficient search algorithm is developed. For two specific applications (interactive translation and multi-source translation) specific search algorithms are developed. The suggested machine translation approach has been tested for the German-English Verbmobil task, the French-English Hansards task and for Chinese-English news text translation. Often, the obtained results are significantly better than those obtained with alternative approaches to machine translation."

The decoding algorithm extends a conventional phrase-based decoder in that it can process at once a large number of source sentence hypotheses contained in the confusion network. Experimental results are presented on a Spanish-English large vocabulary task, namely the translation of the European Parliament plenary sessions. With respect to a conventional SMT decoder processing N-best lists, a slight improvement in the BLEU score is reported as well as a significantly lower decoding time"

An evaluation of the method on translation from German to English shows similar performance to the phrase-based model of Koehn et al. (2003)."

Methods that attempt to fundamentally modify the traditional IBM translation model to incorporate phrases typically do so at a prohibitive computational cost. We present a technique that begins with improved IBM models to create phrase level knowledge sources that effectively represent local as well as global phrasal context. Our method is robust to noisy alignments at both the sentence and corpus level, delivering high quality phrase level translation pairs that contribute to significant improvements in translation quality (as measured by the BLEU metric) over word based lexica as well as a competing alignment based method."

The units of translation are blocks -- pairs of phrases. During decoding, we use a block unigram model and a word-based trigram language model. During training, the blocks are learned from source interval projections using an underlying high-precision word alignment. The system performance is significantly increased by applying a novel block extension algorithm using an additional high-recall word alignment. The blocks are further filtered using unigram-count selection criteria. The system has been successfully test on a Chinese-English and an Arabic-English translation task."

We will give a description of the search algorithm as well as the models that are used in each pass. We participated in the supplied data tracks for manual transcriptions for the following translation directions: Arabic-English, Chinese-English, English-Chinese and Japanese-English. For Japanese-English, we also participated in the C-Star track. In addition, we performed translations of automatic speech recognition output for ChineseEnglish and Japanese-English. For both language pairs, we translated the single-best ASR hypotheses. Additionally, we translated Chinese ASR lattices."

We will present an efficient representation with two key properties: on-demand loading and a prefix tree structure for the source phrases. We will show that this representation scales well to large data tasks and that we are able to store hundreds of millions of phrase pairs in the phrase-table. For the large Chinese\u2010 English NIST task, the memory requirements of the phrase-table are reduced to less than 20MB using the new representation with no loss in translation quality and speed. Additionally, the new representation is not limited to a specific test set, which is important for online or real-time machine translation. One problem in speech translation is the matching of phrases in the input word graph and the phrase-table. We will describe a novel algorithm that effectively solves this combinatorial problem exploiting the prefix tree data structure of the phrase-table. This algorithm enables the use of significantly larger input word graphs in a more efficient way resulting in improved translation quality."

Based on a thorough theoretical framework, we exploit word lattices of automatic speech recognition hypotheses as input to our translation system which is based on weighted finite-state transducers. We show that acoustic recognition scores of the recognized words in the lattices positively and significantly affect the translation quality. In experiments, we have found consistent improvements on three different corpora compared with translations of single best recognized results. In addition we build and evaluate a fully integrated speech translation model."

Over the last years, a variety of automatic evaluation measures have been studied, some of them like Word Error Rate (WER), Position Independent Word Error Rate (PER) and BLEU and NIST scores have become widely used tools for comparing different systems as well as for evaluating improvements within one system. However, these measures do not give any details about the nature of translation errors. Therefore some analysis of the generated output is needed in order to identify the main problems and to focus the research efforts. On the other hand, human evaluation is a time consuming and expensive task. In this paper, we investigate methods for using of morpho-syntactic information for automatic evaluation: standard error measures WER and PER are calculated on distinct word classes and forms in order to get a better idea about the nature of translation errors and possibilities for improvements."

The method is based on the availability of pairs of large corresponding texts that are translations of each other. In our case, the texts are in English and French.Fundamental to the technique is a complex glossary of correspondence of fixed locutions. The steps of the proposed translation process are: (1) Partition the source text into a set of fixed locutions. (2) Use the glossary plus contextual information to select the corresponding set of fixed locutions into a sequence forming the target sentence. (3) Arrange the words of the target fixed locutions into a sequence forming the target sentence.We have developed statistical techniques facilitating both the automatic creation of the glossary, and the performance of the three translation steps, all on the basis of an alignment of corresponding sentences in the two texts.While we are not yet able to provide examples of French / English translation, we present some encouraging intermediate results concerning glossary creation and the arrangement of target word sequences."

For example, head-finding rules are used to augment node labels with lexical heads. In this paper, we provide machinery to reduce the amount of human effort needed to adapt existing models to new corpora: first, we propose a flexible notation for specifying these rules that would allow them to be shared by different models; second, we report on an experiment to see whether we can use Expectation-Maximization to automatically fine-tune a set of hand-written rules to a particular corpus."

Within our framework, we carry out a large number of experiments to understand better and explain why phrase-based models out-perform word-based models. Our empirical results, which hold for all examined language pairs, suggest that the highest levels of performance can be obtained through relatively simple means: heuristic learning of phrase translations from word-based alignments and lexical weighting of phrase translations. Surprisingly, learning phrases longer than three words and learning phrases from high-accuracy word-level alignment models does not have a strong impact on performance. Learning only syntactically motivated phrases degrades the performance of our systems."

In this paper, we present results from the open-track Chinese-to-English condition. Improvements of 5-10% relative BLEU are obtained over a high performing baseline.

                "text": "Abstract At ATR Spoken Language Translation Research Laboratories, we are building a broad-coverage bilingual corpus to study corpus-based speech translation technologies for the real world. There are three important points to consider in designing and constructing a corpus for future speech translation research. The first is to have a variety of speech samples, with a wide range of pronunciations and speakers. The second is to have data for a variety of situations. The third is to have a variety of expressions. This paper reports our trials and discusses the methodology. First, we introduce a bilingual travel conversation (TC) corpus of spoken languages and a broad-coverage bilingual basic expression (BE) corpus. TC and BE are designed to be complementary. TC is a collection of transcriptions of bilingual spoken dialogues, while BE is a collection of Japanese sentences and their English translations. Whereas TC covers a small domain, BE covers a wide variety of domains. We compare the characteristics of vocabulary and expressions between these two corpora and suggest that we need a much greater variety of expressions. One promising approach might be to collect paraphrases representing various different expressions generated by many people for similar concepts."

FreeLing was first released in February 2004 providing morphological analysis and PoS tagging for Catalan, Spanish, and English. From then on, the package has been improved and enlarged to cover more languages (i.e. Italian and Galician) and offer more services: Named entity recognition and classification, chunking, dependency parsing, and WordNet based semantic annotation. FreeLing is not conceived as end-user oriented tool, but as library on top of which powerful NLP applications can be developed. Nevertheless, sample interface programs are provided, which can be straightforwardly used as fast, flexible, and efficient corpus processing tools. A remarkable feature of FreeLing is that it is distributed under a free-software LGPL license, thus enabling any developer to adapt the package to his needs in order to get the most suitable behaviour for the application being developed."

Unlike discriminative reranking approaches, our system can take advantage of learned features in all stages of decoding. We first discuss several challenges to error-driven discriminative approaches. In particular, we explore different ways of updating parameters given a training example. We find that making frequent but smaller updates is preferable to making fewer but larger updates. Then, we discuss an array of features and show both how they quantitatively increase BLEU score and how they qualitatively interact on specific examples. One particular feature we investigate is a novel way to introduce learning into the initial phrase extraction process, which has previously been entirely heuristic."

To accomplish this, the training procedure determines for each feature function its exact error surface on a given set of candidate translations. The feature function weights are then adjusted by traversing the error surface combined over all sentences and picking those values for which the resulting error count reaches a minimum. Typically, candidates in MERT are represented as N-best lists which contain the N most probable translation hypotheses produced by a decoder. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that allows for efficiently constructing and representing the exact error surface of all translations that are encoded in a phrase lattice. Compared to N-best MERT, the number of candidate translations thus taken into account increases by several orders of magnitudes. The proposed method is used to train the feature function weights of a phrase-based statistical machine translation system. Experiments conducted on the NIST 2008 translation tasks show significant runtime improvements and moderate BLEU score gains over N-best MERT."

An FLM represents words as bundles of features (e.g., morphological classes, stems, data-driven clusters, etc.), and induces a probability model covering sequences of bundles rather than just words. GPB extends standard backoff to general conditional probability tables where variables might be heterogeneous types, where no obvious natural (temporal) backoff order exists, and where multiple dynamic backoff strategies are allowed. These methodologies were implemented during the JHU 2002 workshop as extensions to the SRI language modeling toolkit. This paper provides initial perplexity results on both CallHome Arabic and on Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal articles. Significantly, FLMs with GPB can produce bigrams with significantly lower perplexity, sometimes lower than highly-optimized baseline trigrams. In a multi-pass speech recognition context, where bigrams are used to create first-pass bigram lattices or N-best lists, these results are highly relevant."

The segmentation model uses a novel orientation component to handle swapping of neighbor blocks. During training, we collect block unigram counts with orientation: we count how often a block occurs to the left or to the right of some predecessor block. The orientation model is shown to improve translation performance over two models: 1) no block re-ordering is used, and 2) the block swapping is controlled only by a language model. We show experimental results on a standard Arabic-English translation task."

The first method exploits Spanish morphology, and achieves an F1 constituency score of 83.6%. This is an improvement over 81.2% accuracy for the baseline, which makes little or no use of morphological information. The second model uses a reranking approach to add arbitrary global features of parse trees to the morphological model. The reranking model reaches 85.1% F1 accuracy on the Spanish parsing task. The resulting model for Spanish parsing combines an approach that specifically targets morphological information with an approach that makes use of general structural features."

In the standard MAP decoding approach the recognizer outputs the string of words corresponding to the path with the highest posterior probability given the acoustics and a language model. However, even given optimal models, the MAP decoder does not necessarily minimize the commonly used performance metric, word error rate (WER). We describe a method for explicitly minimizing WER by extracting word hypotheses with the highest posterior probabilities from word lattices. We change the standard problem formulation by replacing global search over a large set of sentence hypotheses with local search over a small set of word candidates. In addition to improving the accuracy of the recognizer, our method produces a new representation of a set of candidate hypotheses that specifies the sequence of word-level confusions in a compact lattice format. We study the properties of confusion networks and examine their use for other tasks, such as lattice compression, word spotting, confidence annotation, and reevaluation of recognition hypotheses using higher-level knowledge sources."

We start with an unlexicalized PCFG as a baseline model, which is enriched to the level of Collins' Model 2 by adding lexicalization and subcategorization. The lexicalized sister-head model and a bigram model are also tested, to deal with the flatness of the French Treebank. The bigram model achieves the best performance: 81% constituency F-score and 84% dependency accuracy. All lexicalized models outperform the unlexicalized baseline, consistent with probabilistic parsing results for English, but contrary to results for German, where lexicalization has only a limited effect on parsing performance."

We present a variant of TAGs, called synchronous TAGs, which characterize correspondences between languages. The formalism's intended usage is to relate expressions of natural languages to their associated semantics represented in a logical form language, or to their translates in another natural language; in summary, we intend it to allow TAGs to be used beyond their role in syntax proper. We discuss the application of synchronous TAGs to concrete examples, mentioning primarily in passing some computational issues that arise in its interpretation."

We consider the five alignment models presented in Brown, Della Pietra, Della Pietra, and Mercer (1993), the hidden Markov alignment model, smoothing techniques, and refinements. These statistical models are compared with two heuristic models based on the Dice coefficient. We present different methods for combining word alignments to perform a symmetrization of directed statistical alignment models. As evaluation criterion, we use the quality of the resulting Viterbi alignment compared to a manually produced reference alignment. We evaluate the models on the German-English Verbmobil task and the French-English Hansards task. We perform a detailed analysis of various design decisions of our statistical alignment system and evaluate these on training corpora of various sizes. An important result is that refined alignment models with a first-order dependence and a fertility model yield significantly better results than simple heuristic models. In the Appendix, we present an efficient training algorithm for the alignment models presented."

Frank shows that incorporating TAG's formally restrictive operations for structure building considerably simplifies the model of grammatical competence, particularly in the components concerned with syntactic movement and locality. The empirical advantages of the resulting model, illustrated with extensive case studies of subject-raising constructions and wh-questions, point toward a conception of grammar that is sharply limited in its computational power."

Using this representation, the parsing algorithm of Eisner (1996) is sufficient for searching over all projective trees in O(n3) time. More surprisingly, the representation is extended naturally to non-projective parsing using Chu-Liu-Edmonds (Chu and Liu, 1965; Edmonds, 1967) MST algorithm, yielding an O(n2) parsing algorithm. We evaluate these methods on the Prague Dependency Treebank using online large-margin learning techniques (Crammer et al., 2003; McDonald et al., 2005) and show that MST parsing increases efficiency and accuracy for languages with non-projective dependencies."

Unfortunately, in many complex problems, it is rare that exact search or parameter estimation is tractable. Instead of learning exact models and searching via heuristic means, we embrace this difficulty and treat the structured output problem in terms of approximate search. We present a framework for learning as search optimization, and two parameter updates with convergence the-orems and bounds. Empirical evidence shows that our integrated approach to learning and decoding can outperform exact models at smaller computational cost."
