The model tries to cover the entire range from behavior and phenomenological experience to detailed neural encodings in crude but computationally plausible reductive steps. The problems addressed include perceptual constancies, eye movements and the stable visual world, object descriptions, perceptual generalizations, and the representation of extrapersonal space. The entire development is based on an action-oriented notion of perception. The observer is assumed to be continuously sampling the ambient light for information of current value. The central problem of vision is taken to be categorizing and locating objects in the environment. The critical step in this process is the linking of visual information to symbolic object descriptions; this is called indexing, from the analogy of identifying a book from index terms. The system must also identify situations and use this knowledge to guide movement and other actions in the environment. The treatment focuses on the different representations of information used in the visual system. The four representational frames capture information in the following forms: retinotopic, head-based, symbolic, and allocentric. The functional roles of the four frames, the communication among them, and their suggested neurophysiological realization constitute the core of the paper. The model is perforce crude, but appears to be consistent with all relevant findings."

An observer is called active when engaged in some kind of activity whose purpose is to control the geometric parameters of the sensory apparatus. The purpose of the activity is to manipulate the constraints underlying the observed phenomena in order to improve the quality of the perceptual results. For example a monocular observer that moves with a known or unknown motion or a binocular observer that can rotate his eyes and track environmental objects are just two examples of an observer that we call active. We prove that an active observer can solve basic vision problems in a much more efficient way than a passive one. Problems that are ill-posed and nonlinear for a passive observer become well-posed and linear for an active observer. In particular, the problems of shape from shading and depth computation, shape from contour, shape from texture, and structure from motion are shown to be much easier for an active observer than for a passive one. It has to be emphasized that correspondence is not used in our approach, i.e., active vision is not correspondence of features from multiple viewpoints. Finally, active vision here does not mean active sensing, and this paper introduces a general methodology, a general framework in which we believe low-level vision problems should be addressed."

If it is provided with intentions, knowledge of the environment, and planning capabilities, it can perform highly sophisticated navigational tasks. It is explained why the traditional structure from motion problem cannot be solved in some cases and why there is reason to be pessimistic about the optimal performance of a structure from motion module.

                "text": "AbstractColor constancy is the skill by which it is possible to tell the color of an object even under a colored light. I interpret the color of an object as its color under a fixed canonical light, rather than as a surface reflectance function. This leads to an analysis that shows two distinct sets of circumstances under which color constancy is possible. In this framework, color constancy requires estimating the illuminant under which the image was taken. The estimate is then used to choose one of a set of linear maps, which is applied to the image to yield a color descriptor at each point. This set of maps is computed in advance.The illuminant can be estimated using image measurements alone, because, given a number of weak assumptions detailed in the text, the color of the illuminant is constrained by the colors observed in the image. This constraint arises from the fact that surfaces can reflect no more light than is cast on them. For example, if one observes a patch that excites the red receptor strongly, the illuminant cannot have been deep blue.Two algorithms are possible using this constraint, corresponding to different assumptions about the world. The first algorithm, Crule will work for any surface reflectance. Crule corresponds to a form of coefficient rule, but obtains the coefficients by using constraints on illuminant color. The set of illuminants for which Crule will be successful depends strongly on the choice of photoreceptors: for narrowband photoreceptors, Crule will work in an unrestricted world. The second algorithm, Mwext, requires that both surface reflectances and illuminants be chosen from finite dimensional spaces; but under these restrictive conditions it can recover a large number of parameters in the illuminant, and is not an attractive model of human color constancy.\nCrule has been tested on real images of Mondriaans, and works well. I show results for Crule and for the Retinex algorithm of Land (Land 1971; Land 1983; Land 1985) operating on a number of real images. The experimental work shows that for good constancy, a color constancy system will need to adjust the gain of the receptors it employs in a fashion analagous to adaptation in humans."

                "text": "One of the key problems in machine vision is color constancy: the ability to match object colors in images taken under different colors of illumination. This is a difficult problem because the apparent color will depend upon the spectral reflectance function of the object and the spectral distribution function of the incident light, both of which are generally unknown. Methods to solve this problem use a small number of basis functions to represent the two functions, and some sort of reference knowledge to allow the calculation of the coefficients. Most methods have the weakness that the reference property may not actually hold for all images, or will have too little information to recover enough of the functions to make an accurate determination of what the color should be. We have developed a method for color constancy that uses a color chart of known spectral characteristics to give stronger reference criteria, and with a large number of colors to give enough information to calculate the illuminant to the desired degree of accuracy. We call this approach \"supervised color constancy\" since the process is supervised by a picture of a known color chart. We present here two methods for computing supervised color constancy, one using least squares estimation, the other using a neural network. We show experimental results for the supervised calculation of the spectral power distribution of an unknown illuminant. Once this has been calculated, the color of any object with known reflectance can be reliably predicted. We arc developing an extension to allow the prediction of color appearance for an object whose spectral reflectance function is not known. We also propose a method of \"incremental color constancy\" which determines object color by repeated application of supervised color constancy under changing illumination."

It is also possible to build a self-similar steerable pyramid representation which may be considered to be a steerable wavelet transform. The same concepts can be generalized to the design of 3-D steerable filters, which should be useful in the analysis of image sequences and volumetric data.<<ETX>>"

The first determines the transformation in space that is necessary to bring the viewed object into alignment with possible object-models. The second stage determines the model that best matches the viewed object. The proposed alignment method also uses abstract description, but unlike structural description methods, it uses them pictorially, rather than in symbolic structural descriptions."

We demonstrate that the reflected light from every point on a dielectric object, such as plastic, can be described as a linear combination of the object color and the highlight color. The colors of all light rays reflected from one object then form a planar cluster in the color space. The shape of this cluster is determined by the object and highlight colors and by the object shape and illumination geometry. We present a method that exploits the difference between object color and highlight color to separate the color of every pixel into a matte component and a highlight component. This generates two intrinsic images, one showing the scene without highlights, and the other one showing only the highlights. The intrinsic images may be a useful tool for a variety of algorithms in computer vision, such as stereo vision, motion analysis, shape from shading, and shape from highlights. Our method combines the analysis of matte and highlight reflection with a sensor model that accounts for camera limitations. This enables us to successfully run our algorithm on real images taken in a laboratory setting. We show and discuss the results."

The control strategies are formulated as a search of such sequences of steps that would minimize a loss function while still seeking the most information.

Self-induced movements of an observer relative to rigid bodies in his environment generate charactertistic motion parallax fields. The observer may regard those fields as proprioceptive and interprete the geometrical invariants of the fields as indicators of solid shape. In this way his perceptions become object-oriented, which is the normal case as the many constancy-phenomena show. Similar arguments apply to the disparity field of binocular vision. In this paper we treat the qualitative nature of such fields. [In this case the qualitative nature is basic. Compare the case of an equation with a single unknown. Often one is interested primarily in the qualitative solution (are there roots? How many?), and only slightly in the quantitative information (the numerical value of a root).] The qualitative nature of the fields is fixed if their singularities are known. It is shown that the singularities are of two types: isolated points (so-called specular points) and line-singularities (so-called folds, cusps and T-junctions). It is shown that for most vantage points that an observer can occupy, the topological structure of the set of singularities does not change if the observer performs small exploratory movements. That is most vantage points are stable. At an unstable vantage point the set of singularities changes and the observer experiences an event. Because certain properties of the set of singularities are shown to be preserved, only a few simple types of event are possible. A complete list is presented. The occurrence of an event is shown to be simply related to the solid shape of the objects of vision. Our geometrical theory enables us to understand the structure of the observer's internal models of external bodies."

The spatial and temporal constraint propagation using an integral spatiotemporal model yields image evaluation cycle times of about 0.1 s for simple but realistic tasks with microprocessors available today. Motion control in the dynamic range of humans is thereby possible. Applications discussed are: three-degree-of-freedom planar docking, road vehicle guidance at speeds up to 60 mph and six-degree-of-freedom landing approach of a business jet plane (hardware in the loop simulation).<<ETX>>"

Its utility is most obvious for foveate systems such as the human visual system, but it is a useful strategy for nonfoveate binocular robots as well. Here, we discuss the vergence problem and outline a general approach to vergence control, consisting of a control loop driven by an algorithm that estimates the vergence error. As a case study, this approach is used to verge the eyes of the Rochester Robot in real time. Vergence error is estimated with the cepstral disparity filter. The cepstral filter is analyzed, and it is shown in this application to be equivalent to correlation with an adaptive prefilter; carrying this idea to its logical conclusion converts the cepstral filter into phase correlation. The demonstration system uses a PD controller in cascade with the error estimator. An efficient real-time implementation of the error estimator is discussed, and empirical measures of the performance of both the disparity estimator and the overall system are presented."

The first is based on the fact that, in a rigid environment, the projected velocity at any point in the image is constrained to lie on a 1-D locus in velocity space whose parameters depend only on the observer motion. If the observer motion is known, an independently moving object can, in principle, be detected because its projected velocity is unlikely to fall on this locus. We show how this principle can be adapted to use partial information about the motion field and observer motion that can be rapidly computed from real image sequences. The second method utilizes the fact that the apparent motion of a fixed point due to smooth observer motion changes slowly, while the apparent motion of many moving objects such as animals or maneuvering vehicles may change rapidly. The motion field at a given time can thus be used to place constraints on the future motion field which, if violated, indicate the presence of an autonomously maneuvering object. In both cases, the qualitative nature of the constraints allows the methods to be used with the inexact motion information typically available from real-image sequences. Implementations of the methods that run in real time on a parallel pipelined image processing system are described."

A variety of ana\u00ad tomical and physiological approaches have been employed to analyze the organization of thc visual pathway between the retina and striate cortex (VI ) and the transformations of visual information that occur at each stage (see Hubel & Wiesel 1977, Stone 1 983, Shapley & Lennie 1985). The growth in understanding of the retinostriate pathway has been accompanied by increasing interest in visual processing in the expanse of extrastriate cortex beyond V I . Studies of extrastriate cortex in many spec\u00ad ies showed that it comprises a mosaic of visual areas that can be dis\u00ad tinguished by several anatomical and physiological criteria (reviewed by Kaas 1 978, Zeki 1 978, Cowey 1979, Van Essen 1 979, 1985, Wagor et al 1980, Tusa et al 1 98 1) . The literature in this field is large, and we do not attempt to review all relevant studies. Rather, we concern ourselves with three recent devel\u00ad opments that have yielded insight into information processing and flow within extrastriate cortex. The first of these is the convergence of ana tom-"

This model consists of three stages: (1) convolution of the image with a bank of even-symmetric linear filters followed by half-wave rectification to give a set of responses modeling outputs of V1 simple cells, (2) inhibition, localized in space, within and among the neural-response profiles that results in the suppression of weak responses when there are strong responses at the same or nearby locations, and (3) texture-boundary detection by using wide odd-symmetric mechanisms. Our model can predict the salience of texture boundaries in any arbitrary gray-scale image. A computer implementation of this model has been tested on many of the classic stimuli from psychophysical literature. Quantitative predictions of the degree of discriminability of different texture pairs match well with experimental measurements of discriminability in human observers."

Psychophysical work has led to the formulation of explicit theories of the early stages of color vision. The principal postulates of these theories have been confirmed by physiologists (e.g., the existence of three classes of receptors and second-stage mechanisms in which the signals from these receptors are compared), but some important features of the psychophysical scheme have found limited physiological support. One such issue is the absence of the unitary \"achromatic\" mechanism required by psychophysicists. We know a good deal less about the chromatic analyses that occur beyond these early stages. Although physiologists have devoted much effort to the study of cortical mechanisms, little of this work has been guided by clear ideas of the tasks performed by them. The provision of color constancy and the ability to segment scenes are perhaps the foremost concerns of chromatic mechanisms, and recent psychophysical work bearing on these problems offers physiologists clearer guidance on what to seek with their electrodes."

This paper remedies the deficiency by describing a scheme that interpolates values between units representing fixed numerical quantities. The scheme has nice properties: it extends across functional mappings and it allows different sources of evidence to be combined."

In a color image, the image data are represented as a vector of sensor responses at each point in the image. This vector depends both on the surface reflectance functions and on the spectral power distribution of the ambient illumination. Algorithms designed to classify objects on the basis of their surface reflectance functions typically attempt to overcome the dependence of the sensor responses on the illuminant by integrating sensor data collected from multiple surfaces. In machine vision applications, it is shown that it is often possible to design the sensor spectral responsivities so that the vector direction of the sensor responses does not depend upon the illuminant. The conditions under which this is possible are given and an illustrative calculation is performed. In biological systems, where the sensor responsivities are fixed, it is shown that some changes in the illumination cause no change in the sensor responses. Such changes in illuminant are called black illuminants.<<ETX>>"
