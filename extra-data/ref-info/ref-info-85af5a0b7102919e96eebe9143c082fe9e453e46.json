                "text": "1. We have examined the responses of simple cells in the cat's atriate cortex to visual patterns that were designed to reveal the extent to which these cells may be considered to sum light\u2010evoked influences linearly across their receptive fields. We used one\u2010dimensional luminance\u2010modulated bars and grating as stimuli; their orientation was always the same as the preferred orientation of the neurone under study. The stimuli were presented on an oscilloscope screen by a digital computer, which also accumulated neuronal responses and controlled a randomized sequence of stimulus presentations. 2. The majority of simple cells respond to sinusoidal gratings that are moving or whose contrast is modulated in time in a manner consistent with the hypothesis that they have linear spatial summation. Their responses to moving gratings of all spatial frequencies are modulated in synchrony with the passage of the gratings' bars across their receptive fields, and they do not produce unmodulated responses even at the highest spatial frequencies. Many of these cells respond to temporally modulated stationary gratings simply by changing their response amplitude sinusoidally as the spatial phase of the grating the grating is varied. Nonetheless, their behavior appears to indicate linear spatial summation, since we show in an Appendix that the absence of a 'null' phase in a visual neurone need not indicate non\u2010linear spatial summation, and further that a linear neurone lacking a 'null' phase should give responses of the form that we have observed in this type of simple cell. 3. A minority of simple cells appears to have significant non\u2010linearities of spatial summation. These neurones respond to moving gratings of high spatial frequency with a partially or totally unmodulated elevation of firing rate. They have no 'null' phases when tested with stationary gratings, and reveal their non\u2010linearity by giving responses to gratings of some spatial phases that are composed partly or wholly of even harmonics of the stimulus frequency ('on\u2010off' responses). 4. We compared simple receptive fields with their sensitivity to sinusoidal gratings of different spatial frequencies. Qualitatively, the most sensitive subregions of simple cells' receptive fields are roughly the same width as the individual bars of the gratings to which they are most sensitive. Quantitatively, their receptive field profiles measured with thin stationary lines, agree well with predicted profiles derived by Fourier synthesis of their spatial frequency tuning curves."

Their responses to moving gratings of all but the lowest spatial frequencies are usually dominated by a component that is not modulated by the passage of the bars of the grating across the receptive field. They give responses to temporally modulated stationary gratings that consist mostly of even harmonics of the stimulus frequency and that vary little in amplitude or wave form as the spatial phase of the grating is varied. 2. We compared complex cells' receptive fields with their sensitivity to sinusoidal gratings of different spatial frequencies. Qualitatively, the receptive fields are usually two to five times wider than the bars of the gratings that stimulate them most effectively. Quantitatively, the receptive field profiles of complex cells are invariably broader than those predicted by Fourier synthesis of their spatial frequency tuning curves, and in particular lack predicted spatially antagonistic regions. 3. We further examined the receptive field organization of these cells, using pairs of stationary lines flashed synchronously on their receptive fields. If both lines are of the same polarity (bright or dark), complex cells respond to the paired stimulus much less well than they do to either of its component bars, unless the bars are separated by less than about one quarter of the width of the receptive field. If the lines are of opposite polarity, one bright and one dark, the opposite situation obtains: closely spaced bars elicit small responses, while paired bars of larger separation are much more effective. In either case, the results are independent in general character of the absolute positions of the stimuli within the receptive field; rather, they depend in a manner characteristic of each cell on the relative positions of the two bars. 4. The two\u2010line interaction profile that plots the change in a complex cell's response to one bar as a function of the position of a second added bar corresponds closely to the receptive field profile predicted from Fourier synthesis of the cell's spatial frequency tuning curve. These profiles may thus reveal the spatial characteristics of subunits within complex cell\u2010receptive fields. We examined the nature of the interaction between these subunits by performing several two\u2010line interaction experiments in which the onset of the second bar was delayed some time after the onset of the first. The results suggest that neighbouring subunits interact in a facilitatory fashion: for an interval after the presentation of one bar, responses to neighbouring bars are enhanced. 5. The subunits of a complex receptive field may, by their spatial properties, determine the spatial selectivities of complex cells, while the nature of the interaction among the subunits may determine these cells' sensitivity and selectivity for moving visual stimuli..."

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

Their receptive field (RF) maps of simple cells showed an elongated excitatory center and inhibitory flanks, or vice versa; or two adjacent excitatory and inhibitory areas. Initially HUBEL and WIESEL (2) reported that there was summation within the excitatory and inhibitory regions and an antagonism between them.

The activity of neurones of the visual cortex (area 17) has been recorded in anaesthetized cats in response to gratings of different profile and to single light and dark bars. 2. At very low spatial frequencies, outside the frequency response range to sinusoidal gratings, the response to square\u2010wave drifting gratings is obtainable from a combination of the response to the single bars of the grating presented in isolation. At higher spatial frequencies this is no longer true. 3. At very low spatial frequencies the responses to square\u2010wave gratings and to missing\u2010fundamental gratings (obtained by subtraction from the square\u2010wave grating of its fundamental gratings (obtained by subtraction from the square\u2010wave grating of its fundamental harmonic) are very similar. 4. At spatial frequencies near the peak of the spatial frequency tuning curve of the cell, the responses to square\u2010wave grating and to sinusoidal gratings are very similar. At these spatial frequencies the response to the missing\u2010fundamental grating is practically zero. 5. At spatial frequencies lower than that of best sensitivity for the cell, the response to square\u2010wave gratings is correlated with the 1st and 3rd harmonic of the stimulus. 6. We conclude that at very low spatial frequencies of the grating the response of cortical cells is correlated with the light or dark edges (or light or dark bars) of the stimulus, because the edges contain high frequencies within the range of sensitivity of the cells. At higher spatial frequencies the results are interpreted best by assuming that cortical cells respond to the harmonics of the visual periodic stimulus. 7. When a background of dynamic visual noise is added to increase the spontaneous discharge of simple cells, their response to visual stimuli becomes linear or quasi\u2010linear. The stimuli could be either single bars or gratings."

The forward transform of the signal, obtained by a one dimensional integration, is a representation of the signal in both time and frequency. All transforms of this class are what is defined as a generalized cross-ambiguity function. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a function of two variables to be a generalized cross-ambiguity function are given. The inverse transform is a two dimensional integral over time and frequency. A new method of synthesizing an ambiguity function is demonstrated. The cross-ambiguity function of the unknown signal and a chosen known signal is first obtained, and from this, the unknown signal is obtained by the factorization theorem for cross-ambiguity functions.

These topics have led to such seemingly unrelated studies as the representation of a signal in a combined time-frequency plane, \"instantaneous power spectra,\" and the ambiguity function and its transform relations. It is shown in this paper that the studies can be unified by the introduction of the concept of the complex energy density function of a signal. The function is an extension and combination of the one-dimensional energy density functions in time and frequency, the energy density spectrum |\\Psi(f)|^{2} , and energy density waveform |\\psi (t)|^{2} . On the basis of the complex energy density function, the significance of complicated-appearing transform relations is readily understood. The new concept also conveys a good insight into the internal structure of phase-modulated signals."

In order to keep the classical limit of quantum electrodynamics plainly in view, extensive use is made of the coherent states of the field. These states, which reduce the field correlation functions to factorized forms, are shown to offer a convenient basis for the description of fields of all types. Although they are not orthogonal to one another, the coherent states form a complete set. It is shown that any quantum state of the field may be expanded in terms of them in a unique way. Expansions are also developed for arbitrary operators in terms of products of the coherent state vectors. These expansions are discussed as a general method of representing the density operator for the field. A particular form is exhibited for the density operator which makes it possible to carry out many quantum- mechanical calculations by methods resembling those of classical theory. This representation permits clear insights into the essential distinction between the quantum and classical descriptions of the field. It leads, in addition, to a simple formulation of a superposition law for photon fields. Detailed discussions are given of themore\u00a0\u00bb incoherent fields which are generated by superposing the outputs of many stationary sources. These fields are all shown to have intimately related propenties, some of which have been known for the particular case of blackbody radiation. (auth)\u00ab\u00a0less"
