A video texture provides a continuous infinitely varying stream of images. While the individual frames of a video texture may be repeated from time to time, the video sequence as a whole is never repeated exactly. Video textures can be used in place of digital photos to infuse a static image with dynamic qualities and explicit actions. We present techniques for analyzing a video clip to extract its structure, and for synthesizing a new, similar looking video of arbitrary length. We combine video textures with view morphing techniques to obtain 3D video textures. We also introduce video-based animation, in which the synthesis of video textures can be guided by a user through high-level interactive controls. Applications of video textures and their extensions include the display of dynamic scenes on web pages, the creation of dynamic backdrops for special effects and games, and the interactive control of video-based animation."

This class includes quasi-repeating patterns consisting of small objects of familiar but irregular size, such as flower fields, pebbles, forest undergrowth, bushes and tree branches. The algorithm starts from a sample image and generates a new image of arbitrary size the appearance of which is similar to that of the original image. This new image does not change the basic spatial frequencies the original image; instead it creates an image that is a visually similar, and is of a size set by the user. This method is fast and its implementation is straightforward. We extend the algorithm to allow direct user input for interactive control over the texture synthesis process. This allows the user to indicate large-scale properties of the texture appearance using a standard painting-style interface, and to choose among various candidate textures the algorithm can create by performing different number of iterations."

However, it remains difficult to design an algorithm that is both efficient and capable of generating high quality results. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for realistic texture synthesis. The algorithm is easy to use and requires only a sample texture as input. It generates textures with perceived quality equal to or better than those produced by previous techniques, but runs two orders of magnitude faster. This permits us to apply texture synthesis to problems where it has traditionally been considered impractical. In particular, we have applied it to constrained synthesis for image editing and temporal texture generation. Our algorithm is derived from Markov Random Field texture models and generates textures through a deterministic searching process. We accelerate this synthesis process using tree-structured vector quantization."

Our algorithm is general and automatic and it works well on various types of textures, including 1D sound textures, 2D texture images, and 3D texture movies. The same method is also used to generate 2D texture mixtures that simultaneously capture the appearance of a number of different input textures. In our approach, input textures are treated as sample signals generated by a stochastic process. We first construct a tree representing a hierarchical multiscale transform of the signal using wavelets. From this tree, new random trees are generated by learning and sampling the conditional probabilities of the paths in the original tree. Transformation of these random trees back into signals results in new random textures. In the case of 2D texture synthesis, our algorithm produces results that are generally as good as or better than those produced by previously described methods in this field. For texture mixtures, our results are better and more general than those produced by earlier methods. For texture movies, we present the first algorithm that is able to automatically generate movie clips of dynamic phenomena such as waterfalls, fire flames, a school of jellyfish, a crowd of people, etc. Our results indicate that the proposed technique is effective and robust."

Second, we extend the algorithm to perform texture transfer \u2014 rendering an object with a texture taken from a different object. More generally, we demonstrate how an image can be re-rendered in the style of a different image. The method works directly on the images and does not require 3D information."

It can be used to produce solid textures for creating textured 3-d objects without the distortions inherent in texture mapping. It can also be used to synthesize texture mixtures, images that look a bit like each of several digitized samples. The approach is based on a model of human texture perception, and has potential to be a practically useful tool for graphics applications."

The idea is to progressively cover the surface by texture patches of various sizes and shapes, selected from a single input image. The process starts with large patches. A mapping that minimizes the texture fitting error with already textured neighbouring patches is selected. When this error is above a threshold, the patch is split into smaller ones, and the algorithm recursively looks for good fits at a smaller scale. The process ends when the surface is entirely covered. Our results show that the method correctly handles a wide set of texture patterns, which can be used at different mapping scales. Hierarchical texture mapping only outputs texture coordinates in the original texture for each triangle of the initial mesh. Rendering is therefore easy and memory cost minimal. Moreover the initial geometry is preserved."

The patch-based sampling algorithm works well for a wide variety of textures ranging from regular to stochastic. By sampling patches according to a nonparametric estimation of the local conditional MRF density function, we avoid mismatching features across patch boundaries. We also experimented with documented cases for which pixel-based nonparametric sampling algorithms cease to be effective but our algorithm continues to work well."

The basis of our algorithm is the chaos mosaic, a technique for synthesizing textures with an even and visually stochastic distribution of the local features of the input sample. The chaos mosaic is fast. For synthesizing textures of the same size and comparable quality, our algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than existing algorithms. On a PC we can synthesize a 512 512 texture from a 64 64 sample in just 0.03 second. More importantly, the chaos mosaic facilitates memory efficient texture rendering through procedural texturing. Like traditional solid texture techniques, the chaos mosaic allows us to synthesize and render synthetic textures that, if stored explicitly as textures, would require prohibitively large amount of storage. As an example, we demonstrate that an 100k 100k synthetic texture can be interactively visualized on a modest PC without suffering from latency. Finally, the chaos mosaic can drastically reduce the bandwidth for interactive 3D graphics delivered across the internet."

Fully automated segmentation is an unsolved problem, while manual tracing is inaccurate and laboriously unacceptable. However, Intelligent Scissors allow objects within digital images to be extracted quickly and accurately using simple gesture motions with a mouse. When the gestured mouse position comes in proximity to an object edge, a live-wire boundary \u201csnaps\u201d to, and wraps around the object of interest. Live-wire boundary detection formulates discrete dynamic programming (DP) as a two-dimensional graph searching problem. DP provides mathematically optimal boundaries while greatly reducing sensitivity to local noise or other intervening structures. Robustness is further enhanced with on-the-fly training which causes the boundary to adhere to the specific type of edge currently being followed, rather than simply the strongest edge in the neighborhood. Boundary cooling automatically freezes unchanging segments and automates input of additional seed points. Cooling also allows the user to be much more free with the gesture path, thereby increasing the efficiency and finesse with which boundaries can be extracted. Extracted objects can be scaled, rotated, and composited using live-wire masks and spatial frequency equivalencing. Frequency equivalencing is performed by applying a Butterworth filter which matches the lowest frequency spectra to all other image components. Intelligent Scissors allow creation of convincing compositions from existing images while dramatically increasing the speed and precision with which objects can be extracted."

In this paper, we call these motion patterns textured motion and present a generative method that combines statistical models and algorithms from both texture and motion analysis. The generative method includes the following three aspects. 1). Photometrically, an image is represented as a superposition of linear bases in atomic decomposition using an overcomplete dictionary, such as Gabor or Laplacian. Such base representation is known to be generic for natural images, and it is low dimensional as the number of bases is often 100 times smaller than the number of pixels. 2). Geometrically, each moving element (called moveton), such as the individual snowflake and bird, is represented by a deformable template which is a group of several spatially adjacent bases. Such templates are learned through clustering. 3). Dynamically, the movetons are tracked through the image sequence by a stochastic algorithm maximizing a posterior probability. A classic second order Markov chain model is adopted for the motion dynamics. The sources and sinks of the movetons are modeled by birth and death maps. We adopt an EM-like stochastic gradient algorithm for inference of the hidden variables: bases, movetons, birth/death maps, parameters of the dynamics. The learned models are also verified through synthesizing random textured motion sequences which bear similar visual appearance with the observed sequences."

We instead locate similar neighborhoods for the purpose of replicating editing operations on the original texture itself, thereby creating a fundamentally new texture.

In a two-phase process, the input texture is first analyzed by measuring the joint occurrence of texture discrimination features at multiple resolutions. In the second phase, a new texture is synthesized by sampling successive spatial frequency bands from the input texture, conditioned on the similar joint occurrence of features at lower spatial frequencies. Textures synthesized with this method more successfully capture the characteristics of input textures than do previous techniques."

In this procedure, the images to be splined are first decomposed into a set of band-pass filtered component images. Next, the component images in each spatial frequency hand are assembled into a corresponding bandpass mosaic. In this step, component images are joined using a weighted average within a transition zone which is proportional in size to the wave lengths represented in the band. Finally, these band-pass mosaic images are summed to obtain the desired image mosaic. In this way, the spline is matched to the scale of features within the images themselves. When coarse features occur near borders, these are blended gradually over a relatively large distance without blurring or otherwise degrading finer image details in the neighborhood of th e border."

It enables us to develop optimal vision algorithms systematically when used with optimization principles. This book presents a comprehensive study on the use of MRFs for solving computer vision problems. The book covers the following parts essential to the subject: introduction to fundamental theories, formulations of MRF vision models, MRF parameter estimation, and optimization algorithms. Various vision models are presented in a unified framework, including image restoration and reconstruction, edge and region segmentation, texture, stereo and motion, object matching and recognition, and pose estimation. This book is an excellent reference for researchers working in computer vision, image processing, statistical pattern recognition, and applications of MRFs. It is also suitable as a text for advanced courses in these areas."

The model is parameterized by a set of statistics computed on pairs of coefficients corresponding to basis functions at adjacent spatial locations, orientations, and scales. We develop an efficient algorithm for synthesizing random images subject to these constraints, by iteratively projecting onto the set of images satisfying each constraint, and we use this to test the perceptual validity of the model. In particular, we demonstrate the necessity of subgroups of the parameter set by showing examples of texture synthesis that fail when those parameters are removed from the set. We also demonstrate the power of our model by successfully synthesizing examples drawn from a diverse collection of artificial and natural textures."

An alternative method using a single table of values representing the integral over the texture function rather than the function itself may yield superior results at similar cost.

The method employs a novel data structure called the windowed-sum-squared-table, and uses the fast Fourier transform (FFT) in its computation of the sum squared difference (SSD) metric. Use of the SSD metric allows for higher peak signal to noise ratios than other fast block matching algorithms which require the sum of absolute difference (SAD) metric. However, because of the complex floating point and integer math used in our computation of the SSD metric, our method is aimed at software implementations only. Test results show that our method has a running time 13%-29% of that for the exhaustive search, depending on the size of the search range."

We model image sequences of temporal textures using the spatio-temporal autoregressive model (STAR). This model expresses each pixel as a linear combination of surrounding pixels lagged both in space and in time. The model provides a base for both recognition and synthesis. We show how the least squares method can accurately estimate model parameters for large, causal neighborhoods with more than 1000 parameters. Synthesis results show that the model can adequately capture the spatial and temporal characteristics of many temporal textures. A 95% recognition rate is achieved for a 135 element database with 15 texture classes."

In this book, Sedgewick offers the same successful blend of theory and practice with concise implementations that can be tested on real applications, which has made his work popular with programmers for many years. Algorithms in C, Third Edition, Part 5: Graph Algorithms is the second book in Sedgewick's thoroughly revised and rewritten series. The first book, Parts 1-4, addresses fundamental algorithms, data structures, sorting, and searching. A forthcoming third book will focus on strings, geometry, and a range of advanced algorithms. Each book's expanded coverage features new algorithms and implementations, enhanced descriptions and diagrams, and a wealth of new exercises for polishing skills. A focus on abstract data types makes the programs more broadly useful and relevant for the modern object-oriented programming environment.Coverage includes: A complete overview of graph properties and types Diagraphs and DAGs Minimum spanning trees Shortest paths Network flows Diagrams, sample C code, and detailed algorithm descriptions The Web site for this book (http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/) provides additional source code for programmers along with numerous support materials for educators.A landmark revision, Algorithms in C, Third Edition, Part 5 provides a complete tool set for programmers to implement, debug, and use graph algorithms across a wide range of computer applications."

The models and algorithms introduced in Flows in Networks are used widely today in the fields of transportation systems, manufacturing, inventory planning, image processing, and Internet traffic. The techniques presented by Ford and Fulkerson spurred the development of powerful computational tools for solving and analyzing network flow models, and also furthered the understanding of linear programming. In addition, the book helped illuminate and unify results in combinatorial mathematics while emphasizing proofs based on computationally efficient construction. Flows in Networks is rich with insights that remain relevant to current research in engineering, management, and other sciences. This landmark work belongs on the bookshelf of every researcher working with networks."
