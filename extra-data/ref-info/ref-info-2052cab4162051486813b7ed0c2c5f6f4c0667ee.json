This is a parameterized geometric model of the object to be recognized together with a measure of how well it fits the image data. Variations in the parameters correspond to allowable deformations of the object and can be specified by a probabilistic model. After the extraction stage the parameters of the deformable template can be used for object description and recognition."

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture."

Am.4, 519\u2013 524 ( 1987)] that identifiable faces can be made by using only a subset of the eigenvectors, i.e., those with the largest eigenvalues. This low-dimensional representation is optimal in that it minimizes the squared error between the representation of the face image and the original face image. The present study demonstrates that, whereas this low-dimensional representation is optimal for identifying the physical categories of face, like sex, it is not optimal for recognizing the faces (i.e., discriminating known from unknown faces). Various low-dimensional representations of the faces in the higher dimensions of the face space (i.e., the eigenvectors with smaller eigenvalues) provide better information for face recognition."

This approach goes beyond edge-based and area-based approaches by using a richer image description and incorporating several stereo cues that previously have been neglected in the computer vision literature. A technique based on using the pseudo-inverse is presented for characterizing the information present in a vector of filter responses. We show how in our framework viewing geometry can be recovered to determine the locations of epipolar lines. An assumption that visible surfaces in the scene are piecewise smooth leads to differential treatment of image regions corresponding to binocularly visible surfaces, surface boundaries, and occluded regions that are only monocularly visible. The constraints imposed by viewing geometry and piecewise smoothness are incorporated into an iterative algorithm that gives good results on random-dot stereograms, artificially generated scenes, and natural grey-level images."

It starts with a definition of \"shape\" for a set of k points in m dimensions. The first task is to identify the shape spaces in which such objects naturally live, and then to examine the probability structures induced on such a shape space by corresponding structures in Rm. Against this theoretical background one formulates and solves statistical problems concerned with shape characteristics of empirical sets of points. Some applications (briefly sketched here) are to archeology, astronomy, geography and physical chemistry. We also outline more recent work on \"size-and-shape,\" on shapes of sets of points in riemannian spaces, and on shape-theoretic aspects of random Delaunay tessellations."

                "text": "Biometric studies of the forms of organisms usually consider size and shape variations in the geometric configuration of landmarks, points that correspond biologically from form to form. The size variables may be usefully considered the linear vector space spanned by the set of all distances between pairs of landmarks. The shape of a single triangle AABC of landmarks may be reduced to a single pair of shape coordinates locating the vertex C in the coordinate system with landmark A sent to (0,O) and landmark B to (1,O). A useful space of shape variables is the span of all such shape coordinate pairs for various triples of landmarks. On a convenient null model of identical circular normal perturbations at each landmark independently, one size variable S , which may be taken as the mean square of all the interlandmark distances, has covariance zero with every shape variable. Then associations between shape and size may be tested by the F ratio for multiple regression of S on any basis for shape space. For a single triangle of landmarks, the existence of any mean difference or mean change in shape may be tested by Hotelling's T 2 applied to any pair of shape coordinates for that triangle. When such a difference is statistically significant, it may be interpreted as the ratio of a pair of size variables measured along directions a t an angle averaging 90\" in the samples of forms. One size variable will bear the greatest mean rate or ratio of change between the forms, the other the least. Analysis of configurations of more than three landmarks reduces to consideration of size variables involving at most three landmarks. These techniques are demonstrated in a study of the growth of the head in 62 normal Ann Arbor youth. Each comparison of interest is summarized in its own orthogonal coordinate system, the biorthogonal grid pair."

The shape density is written in a closed form, in terms of Kendall's or Bookstein's shape variables. The distribution simplifies considerably in certain cases, including the complex normal, isotropic, circular Markov and equal means cases. Various asymptotic properties of the distribution are investigated, including a large variation distribution and the normal approximation for small variations. The triangle case is considered in particular detail, and we compare the density with simulated densities for some examples. Finally, we consider inference problems, with an application in biology."

When m = 1, we find that Y\\ = S k ~ 2 ; when m ^ 3, the shape-space contains singularities. This paper deals mainly with the case m = 2, when the shape-space I* ca n be identified with a version of CP*~ 2 . Of special importance are the shape-measures induced on CP k ~ 2 by any assigned diffuse law of distribution for the k vertices. We determine several such shape-measures, we resolve some of the technical problems associated with the graphic presentation and statistical analysis of empirical shape distributions, and among applications we discuss the relevance of these ideas to testing for the presence of non-accidental multiple alignments in collections of (i) neolithic stone monuments and (ii) quasars. Finally the recently introduced Ambartzumian density is examined from the present point of view, its norming constant is found, and its connexion with random Crofton polygons is established."
