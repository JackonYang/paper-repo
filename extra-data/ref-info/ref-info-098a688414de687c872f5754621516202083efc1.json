We introduce a novel method of power-law transformation on the word image for binarization. We show the improvement in image binarization and the consequent increase in the recognition performance of OCR engine on the word image. The optimal value of gamma for a word image is automatically chosen by our algorithm with fixed stroke width threshold. We have exhaustively experimented our algorithm by varying the gamma and stroke width threshold value. By varying the gamma value, we found that our algorithm performed better than the results reported in the literature. On the ICDAR Robust Reading Systems Challenge-1: Word Recognition Task on born digital dataset, as compared to the recognition rate of 61.5% achieved by TH-OCR after suitable pre-processing by Yang et. al. and 63.4% by ABBYY Fine Reader (used as baseline by the competition organizers without any preprocessing), we achieved 82.9% using Omnipage OCR applied on the images after being processed by our algorithm."

As a result, the recognition results reported on the scenic word image datasets of ICDAR have been low. We introduce a novel technique, where we choose the middle row of the image as a sub-image and segment it first. Then, the labels from this segmented sub-image are used to propagate labels to other pixels in the image. This approach, which is unique and distinct from the existing methods, results in improved segmentation. Bayesian classification and Max-flow methods have been independently used for label propagation. This midline based approach limits the impact of degradations that happens to the image. The segmented text image is recognized using the trial version of Omnipage OCR. We have tested our method on ICDAR 2003 and ICDAR 2011 datasets. Our word recognition results of 64.5% and 71.6% are better than those of methods in the literature and also methods that competed in the Robust reading competition. Our method makes an implicit assumption that degradation is not present in the middle row."

These images have been cropped from camera captured scene images, born digital images (BDI) and street view images. Using the Matlab based tool developed by us, we have annotated at the pixel level more than 3600 word images from the five data sets. The word images binarized by the tool, as well as by our own midline analysis and propagation of segmentation (MAPS) algorithm are recognized using the trial version of Nuance Omnipage OCR and these two results are compared with the best reported in the literature. The benchmark word recognition rates obtained on ICDAR 2003, Sign evaluation, Street view, Born-digital and ICDAR 2011 data sets are 83.9%, 89.3%, 79.6%, 88.5% and 86.7%, respectively. The results obtained from MAPS binarized word images without the use of any lexicon are 64.5% and 71.7% for ICDAR 2003 and 2011 respectively, and these values are higher than the best reported values in the literature of 61.1% and 41.2%, respectively.

The proposed method is novel, as it (i) departs from a strict feed-forward pipeline and replaces it by a hypothesesverification framework simultaneously processing multiple text line hypotheses, (ii) uses synthetic fonts to train the algorithm eliminating the need for time-consuming acquisition and labeling of real-world training data and (iii) exploits Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSERs) which provides robustness to geometric and illumination conditions. \n \nThe performance of the method is evaluated on two standard datasets. On the Char74k dataset, a recognition rate of 72% is achieved, 18% higher than the state-of-the-art. The paper is first to report both text detection and recognition results on the standard and rather challenging ICDAR 2003 dataset.

We represent the pixels in a document image as random variables in an MRF, and introduce a new energy (or cost) function on these variables. Each variable takes a foreground or background label, and the quality of the binarization (or labelling) is determined by the value of the energy function. We minimize the energy function, i.e. find the optimal binarization, using an iterative graph cut scheme. Our model is robust to variations in foreground and background colours as we use a Gaussian Mixture Model in the energy function. In addition, our algorithm is efficient to compute, and adapts to a variety of document images. We show results on word images from the challenging ICDAR 2003 dataset, and compare our performance with previously reported methods. Our approach shows significant improvement in pixel level accuracy as well as OCR accuracy."

To evaluate the performance of recent algorithms in detecting and recognizing text from complex images, the ICDAR 2011 Robust Reading Competition was organized. Challenge 2 of the competition dealt specifically with detecting/recognizing text in natural scene images. This paper presents an overview of the approaches that the participants used, the evaluation measure, and the dataset used in the Challenge 2 of the contest. We also report the performance of all participating methods for text localization and word recognition tasks and compare their results using standard methods of area precision/recall and edit distance."

With the rapid growth in research over the last few years on recognizing text in natural scenes, there is an urgent need to establish some common benchmark datasets and gain a clear understanding of the current state of the art. We use the term \u2018robust reading\u2019 to refer to text images that are beyond the capabilities of current commercial OCR packages. We chose to break down the robust reading problem into three subproblems and run competitions for each stage, and also a competition for the best overall system. The subproblems we chose were text locating, character recognition and word recognition. By breaking down the problem in this way, we hoped to gain a better understanding of the state of the art in each of the subproblems. Furthermore, our methodology involved storing detailed results of applying each algorithm to each image in the datasets, allowing researchers to study in depth the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. The text-locating contest was the only one to have any entries. We give a brief description of each entry and present the results of this contest, showing cases where the leading entries succeed and fail. We also describe an algorithm for combining the outputs of the individual text locators and show how the combination scheme improves on any of the individual systems."

The problem is significantly more challenging than reading text in scanned documents, and has only recently gained attention from the computer vision community. Sub-components of the problem, such as text detection and cropped image word recognition, have been studied in isolation [7, 4, 20]. However, what is unclear is how these recent approaches contribute to solving the end-to-end problem of word recognition. We fill this gap by constructing and evaluating two systems. The first, representing the de facto state-of-the-art, is a two stage pipeline consisting of text detection followed by a leading OCR engine. The second is a system rooted in generic object recognition, an extension of our previous work in [20]. We show that the latter approach achieves superior performance. While scene text recognition has generally been treated with highly domain-specific methods, our results demonstrate the suitability of applying generic computer vision methods. Adopting this approach opens the door for real world scene text recognition to benefit from the rapid advances that have been taking place in object recognition."

In this paper, a method is proposed for segmenting colour natural scene texts which suffer from a wide range of degradations with complex background. A text image is firstly processed by two 3-means clustering operations with different distance measurements. Then, a modified connected component (CC)-based validation method is used to obtain the text area after clustering. Thirdly, a proposed objective segmentation evaluation method is utilised to choose the final segmentation result from the two segmented text images. The proposed method is compared with other existing methods based on the ICDAR2003 public database. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method."

Recognizing such text is a challenging problem, even more so than the recognition of scanned documents. In this work, we focus on the problem of recognizing text extracted from street images. We present a framework that exploits both bottom-up and top-down cues. The bottom-up cues are derived from individual character detections from the image. We build a Conditional Random Field model on these detections to jointly model the strength of the detections and the interactions between them. We impose top-down cues obtained from a lexicon-based prior, i.e. language statistics, on the model. The optimal word represented by the text image is obtained by minimizing the energy function corresponding to the random field model. We show significant improvements in accuracies on two challenging public datasets, namely Street View Text (over 15%) and ICDAR 2003 (nearly 10%)."

Several parameters bring different information and this paper tries to explain how to use this complementarity. It is mainly based on the discrimination between two kinds of backgrounds: clean or complex. On one hand, this separation is useful to apply a particular algorithm on each of these cases and on the other hand to decrease the computation time for clean cases for which a faster method could be considered. Finally, several experiments were done to discuss results and to conclude that the use of a discrimination between kinds of backgrounds gives better results in terms of Precision and Recall."

In this paper, we apply several state-of-the-art techniques of handwritten character recognition on this baseline system to improve the recognition accuracy. In feature extraction stage, gradient feature is extracted to replace DEF, which provides higher resolution on both magnitude and angle of the directional strokes in character image. In classification stage, the performance of MQDF classifier is enhanced by multiple discrimination schemes, including minimum classification error (MCE) training on the classifier parameters and modified distance representation for similar characters discrimination. All these techniques we use lead to improvement on the character recognition rate. The performance of the improved recognition system has been evaluated by both handwritten digit recognition and handwritten Chinese character recognition experiments, in which very promising results are achieved."

The method employs an edge-based connected component approach and automatically determines a threshold for each component. It has several advantages over existing binarization methods. Firstly, it can handle documents with multi-colored texts with different background shades. Secondly, the method is applicable to documents having text of widely varying sizes, usually not handled by local binarization methods. Thirdly, the method automatically computes the threshold for binarization and the logic for inverting the output from the image data and does not require any input parameter. The proposed method has been applied to a broad domain of target document types and environment and is found to have a good adaptability."

Rather than operating on the entire image, a \u2018small\u2019 representative set of color pixels is first identified using the contour information. The method involves the following steps: (i) Identification of prototype colors (ii) A one-pass algorithm to identify color clusters that serve as seeds for the refining step using kmeans clustering (iii) Assignment of pixels in the original image to the nearest color cluster (iv) Identification of potential candidate text regions in individual color layer and (v) Adaptive binarization. We propose a robust binarization technique to threshold the identified text regions, taking into account the presence of inverse texts, such that the output image always has black text on a white background. Experiments on several complex images having large variations in font, size, color, orientation and script illustrate the robustness of the method."

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

A new set of image elements that are put into correspondence, the so called extremal regions, is introduced. Extremal regions possess highly desirable properties: the set is closed under 1. continuous (and thus projective) transformation of image coordinates and 2. monotonic transformation of image intensities. An efficient (near linear complexity) and practically fast detection algorithm (near frame rate) is presented for an affinely-invariant stable subset of extremal regions, the maximally stable extremal regions (MSER). A new robust similarity measure for establishing tentative correspondences is proposed. The robustness ensures that invariants from multiple measurement regions (regions obtained by invariant constructions from extremal regions), some that are significantly larger (and hence discriminative) than the MSERs, may be used to establish tentative correspondences. The high utility of MSERs, multiple measurement regions and the robust metric is demonstrated in wide-baseline experiments on image pairs from both indoor and outdoor scenes. Significant change of scale (3.5\u00d7), illumination conditions, out-of-plane rotation, occlusion , locally anisotropic scale change and 3D translation of the viewpoint are all present in the test problems. Good estimates of epipolar geometry (average distance from corresponding points to the epipolar line below 0.09 of the inter-pixel distance) are obtained."
