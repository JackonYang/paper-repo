We focus on real-world time series of limited record length. Two examples are analyzed: the benchmark sunspot series and chaotic data from a computational ecosystem. The problem of overfitting, particularly serious for short records of noisy data, is addressed both by using the statistical method of validation and by adding a complexity term to the cost function (\"back-propagation with weight-elimination\"). The dimension of the dynamics underlying the time series, its Liapunov coefficient, and its nonlinearity can be determined via the network. We also show why sigmoid units are superior in performance to radial basis functions for high-dimensional input spaces. Furthermore, since the ultimate goal is accuracy in the prediction, we find that sigmoid networks trained with the weight-elimination algorithm outperform traditional nonlinear statistical approaches."

We are interested in one aspect of parallel processing, i.e. the design and analysis of parallel algorithms. Here, we focus on non-numerical parallel algorithms for basic combinatorial problems, such as data structures, selection, searching, merging and sorting. The purposes of studying these types of problems are to obtain basic building blocks which will be useful in solving complex problems, and to develop fundamental algorithmic techniques. \nIn this thesis, we study the following problems: priority queues, multiple search and multiple selection, and reconstruction of a binary tree from its traversals. The research on priority queue was motivated by its various applications. The purpose of studying multiple search and multiple selection is to explore the relationships between four of the most fundamental problems in algorithm design, that is, selection, searching, merging and sorting; while our parallel solutions can be used as subroutines in algorithms for other problems. The research on the last problem, reconstruction of a binary tree from its traversals, was stimulated by a challenge proposed in a recent paper by Berkman et al. (\"Highly Parallelizable Problems,\" STOC 89) to design doubly logarithmic time optimal parallel algorithms because a remarkably small number of such parallel algorithms exist."
