In contrast to other feature-based frameworks, such as PATR-II (Shieber 1986, Shieber et al. 1983), LFG, or GPSG, HPSG does not rely on a context-free backbone; constituency is only one of the attributes of the linguistic object par excellence, the linguistic sign. It is on a par with other syntactic and semantic attributes. Moreover, HPSG is characterized by a systematic use of typing of feature structures (not unlike the use of templates in PATR-II). It is similar to DATR (Evans and Gazdar 1989a, 1989b) in this respect. HPSG uses a multiple-inheritance scheme over those types to cross-classify linguistic objects. Although they leave the question open, P&S de facto use a strict inheritance scheme in their analyses, rather than the default inheritance sometimes used in similar approaches (see Briscoe, de Paiva, and Copestake 1993). Overall, then, the formalism that HPSG uses, which owes a lot to King (1989), is very close to that discussed in detail in Carpenter (1992), for example. But for typing it uses a logic similar to that developed by Kasper and Rounds (1986) or Keller (1993). Typing in HPSG is used to factor out shared properties of linguistic objects, be they words, phrases, or anything else, into appropriate classes."

                "text": "\"Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar\" provides the definitive exposition of the theory of grammar originally proposed by Gerald Gazdar and developed during half a dozen years' work with his colleagues Ewan Klein, Geoffrey Pullum, and Ivan Sag. This long-awaited book contains both detailed specifications of the theory and extensive illustrations of its power to describe large parts of English grammar. Experts who wish to evaluate the theory and students learning GPSP for the first time will find this book an invaluable guide.The initial chapters lay out the theoretical machinery of GPSP in a readily intelligible way. Combining informal discussion with precise formalization, the authors describe all major aspects of their grammatical system, including a complete theory of syntactic features, phrase structure rules, meta rules, and feature instantiation principles. The book then shows just what a GPSP analysis of English syntax can accomplish. Topics include the internal structure of phrases, unbounded dependency constructions of many varieties, and coordinate conjunction a construction long considered the sticking point for phrase structure approaches to syntax.The book concludes with a well developed proposal for a model theoretic semantic system to go along with GPSP syntax. Throughout, the authors maintain the highest standards of explicitness and rigor in developing and assessing their grammatical system. Their aim is to provide the best possible test of the hypothesis that syntactic description can be accomplished in a single-level system. And more generally, it is their intention to formulate a grammatical framework in which linguistic universals follow directly from the form of the system and therefore require no explicit statement. Their book sets new methodological standards for work in generative grammar while presenting a grammatical system of extraordinary scope.\""

                "text": "For those of us who belonged to the \"Bay Area (Computational) Linguistics Community,\" the early eighties were a heady time. Local researchers working on linguistics, computational linguistics, and logic programming were investigating notions of category, type, feature, term, and partial specification that appeared to converge to a powerful new approach for describing (linguistic) objects and their relationships by monotonic accumulation of constraints between their features. The seed notions had almost independently arisen in generalized phrase structure grammar (GPSG) (Gazdar et al. 1985), lexical-functional grammar (LFG) (Bresnan and Kaplan 1982), functionalunification grammar (FUG) (Kay 1985), logic programming (Colmerauer 1978, Pereira and Warren 1980), and terminological reasoning systems (Ait-Kaci 1984). It took, however, a lot of experimental and theoretical work to identify precisely what the core notions were, how particular systems related to the core notions, and what were the most illuminating mathematical accounts of that core. The development of the unificationbased formalism PATR-II (Shieber 1984) was an early step toward the definition of the core, but its mathematical analysis, and the clarification of the connections between the various systems, are only now coming to a reasonable closure. The Logic of Typed Feature Structures is the first monograph that brings all the main theoretical ideas into one place where they can be related and compared in a unified setting. Carpenter's book touches most of the crucial questions of the developments during the decade, provides proofs for central results, and reaches right up to the edge of current research in the field. These contributions alone make it an indispensable compendium for the researcher or graduate student working on constraint-based grammatical formalisms, and they also make it a very useful reference work for researchers in object-oriented databases and logic programming. Having discharged the main obligation of the reviewer of saying who should read the book under review and why, I will now survey each of the book's four parts while raising some more general questions impinging on the whole book as they arise from the discussion of each part."

In this regard, it cannot be criticized as designed in a too rigid way from the implementational viewpoint and not adaptable to new situations and unforeseen phenomena. The separation of data structures from the procedures and the modularity of the system are features that are essential to the extendability of the system to other domains. In general, the work is a good example of: 1. the necessity of creating extensive lexicons, where \"extensive\" must be intended both in breadth (i.e., in quantitative terms) and in depth (i.e., from aqualitative viewpoint, as to the types of information associated with the entries); 2. the necessity of working with large textual corpora, both for obtaining linguistic data and for testing systems. This is encouraging for a trend that is in recent years showing up, and having, for example, in Europe, great success also in projects sponsored by national and international organizations."

Although computational algorithms for unification of feature structures have been worked out in experimental research, these algorithms become quite complicated, and a more precise description of feature structures is desirable. We have developed a model in which descriptions of feature structures can be regarded as logical formulas, and interpreted by sets of directed graphs which satisfy them. These graphs are, in fact, transition graphs for a special type of deterministic finite automation.This semantics for feature structures extends the ideas of Pereira and Shieber [11], by providing an interpretation for values which are specified by disjunctions and path values embedded within disjunctions. Our interpretation differs from that of Pereira and Shieber by using a logical model in place of a denotational semantics. This logical model yields a calculus of equivalences, which can be used to simplify formulas.Unification is attractive, because of its generality, but it is often computationally inefficient. Our model allows a careful examination of the computational complexity of unification. We have shown that the consistency problem for formulas with disjunctive values is NP-complete. To deal with this complexity, we describe how disjunctive values can be specified in a way which delays expansion to disjunctive normal form."

                "text": "Many recent lexical and syntactic theories have used TYPE HIERARCHIES to model linguistic generalizations, including valence alternations, morphological generalizations, subregularities, and positive exceptions (Bobrow & Webber 1980; Flickinger et al. 1985; Hudson 1984; Lakoff 1987; Pollard & Sag 1987; Jurafsky 1992; Briscoe et al. 1994; Pollard & Sag 1994). Despite these successes, current type hierarchies are unable to model LEXICAL PRODUCTIVITY: the kind of productive patterns which occur in morphologically recursive languages, lexical borrowing and learning, and productive valence alternations (Hankamer 1989; Pinker 1989). This failure is due to the traditional conception of lexical types as generalizations over actual fully specified entries, functioning like redundancy rules. A lexical type hierarchy gives us an inventory of the word classes in a language, but does not tell us how to use productive processes like inflection to create new forms. To model lexical productivity, we propose to underspecify the type hierarchy. For example, rather than store a type for each surface form of each word of the language, we store a single type for each root and each productive morphological template. Then these types are combined on-line to build types for surface forms in processing or producing an utterance, by an algorithm we call ON-LINE TYPE CREATION. Thus some of the burden typically borne by the lexical type hierarchy is shifted to the processing component, which combines these types on-line. Although our system is embedded in the specific framework of CONSTRUCTION GRAMMAR (Fillmore et al. 1988; Kay 1990; Lakoff 1987; Goldberg 1991; Goldberg 1992; Koenig 1993), it is directly applicable to any typed theory such as HPSG. In fact, we show that on-line type construction can advantageously replace mechanisms like lexical rules which are used in HPSG to model lexical productivity."

                "text": "Agreement and government can give rise to syntactic feature conflicts; e.g., a verb may have to agree in gender with a coordinate NP composed of NP's of differing genders. The resolution of such conflicts is to some extent determined by general semantic or syntactic principles ('principled resolution'). In addition, the existence of a governed or agreeing form that is neutral with respect to the features in question always permits a conflict to be resolved. There is idiolectal variation as to when principled resolution occurs, and also as to which neutral forms appear in the lexicon. But there are also cases (examples are provided from English, Xhosa, and German) in which resolution is permitted on the basis of a purely phonological resemblance; i.e., the fact that the conflicting morphosyntactic requirements lead accidentally to similar phonological consequences is sufficient to prevent the conflict from causing ungrammaticality. Four major claims are made here about the phenomenon of phonological resolution. First, it does not imply that there can be language-particular phonological conditions on syntactic rules; a universal statement is involved. Second, phonological identity cannot compensate for syntactic feature distinctness in general, even in those languages that clearly exemplify phonological resolution; the conflicting items must also differ only in syntactically imposed features. Third, it is not the underlying phonological form of an item that determines whether it can count as phonologically identical to another item in cases of true phonological resolution; these items must be identical at a more superficial level (conjectured to be identical to the 'lexical stratum' of lexical phonology). Fourth, a small sampling of data (from Icelandic and Finnish, as well as the languages already listed) suggests variation with respect to the number of syntactic feature differences that can be surmounted in phonological resolution.*"

                "text": "The virtues of viewing the lexicon as an inheritance network are its succinctness and its tendency to highlight significant clusters of linguistic properties. From its succinctness follow two practical advantages, namely its ease of maintenance and modification. In this paper we present a feature-based foundation for lexical inheritance. We argue that the feature-based foundation is both more economical and expressively more powerful than non-feature-based systems. It is more economical because it employs only mechanisms already assumed to be present elsewhere in the grammar (viz., in the feature system), and it is more expressive because feature systems are more expressive than other mechanisms used in expressing lexical inheritance (cf. DATR). The lexicon furthermore allows the use of default unification, based on the ideas of default unification, defined by Bouma. These claims are buttressed in sections sketching the opportunities for lexical description in feature-based lexicons in two central lexical topics, inflection and derivation. Briefly, we argue that the central notion of paradigm may be defined in feature structures, and that it may be more satisfactorily (in fact, immediately) linked to the syntactic information in this fashion. Our discussion of derivation is more programmatic; but here, too, we argue that feature structures of a suitably rich sort provide a foundation for the definition of lexical rules. We illustrate theoretical claims in application to German lexis. This work is currently under implementation in a natural language understanding effort (DISCO) at the German Artiffical Intelligence Center (Deutsches Forschungszentrum fur Kunstliche Intelligenz)."
