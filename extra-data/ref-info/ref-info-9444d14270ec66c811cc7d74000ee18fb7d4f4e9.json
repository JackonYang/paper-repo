The paper emphasizes the historical development of the new system, beginning as a supplement to SL-resolution in the form of classificatmn trees and incorporating an analogue of the Waltz algorithm for picture Interpretation The paper ends with a discussion of the opportunities for using look-ahead to guide the search for proofs"

There are nine labels associated with each image point, eight labels indicating line segments at various orientations and one indicating the no-line case. Attached to each label is a probability. In the relaxation process, interaction takes place among the probabilities at neighboring points. This permits line segments in compatible orientations to strengthen one another, and incompatible segments to weaken one another. Similarly, no-line labels are reinforced by neighboring no-line labels and weakened by appropriately oriented line labels. This process converges, in only a few iterations, to a condition in which points lying on long curves have achieved high line probabilities, while other points have high no-line probabilities, There is some tendency, under this process, for curves to thicken; however, a thinning procedure can be incorporated to counteract this. The process is effective even for curves of low contrast, and even when many curves lie close to one another."

The characterization theorem states that any homomorphism from one relation to another can be represented as the intersection of some basis relations. Furthermore, appropriate intersections of the basis relations define a relation homomorphism. The characterization theorem leads to an efficient algorithm for determining all the homomorphisms from one relation to another: first find the basis relations, and then use the basis relations to generate all single-valued relations which then will be all the homomorphisms from one relation to the other. Specialization of the procedure easily determines whether two relations or digraphs are isomorphic."
