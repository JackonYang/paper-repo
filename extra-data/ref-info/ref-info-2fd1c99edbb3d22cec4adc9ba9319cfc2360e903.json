A retinally connected neural network examines small windows of an image and decides whether each window contains a face. The system arbitrates between multiple networks to improve performance over a single network. We use a bootstrap algorithm for training the networks, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art face detection systems are presented; our system has better performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates."

Detecting rotated faces is a two step procedure. First a \\DeRotation\" network is used to process each input window. If there is a face in the window, this network determines its angle of rotation. Based upon this estimated angle of rotation, the window is then rotated to an upright position. Second, a \\Detection\" network, or multiple detection networks, are used to determine whether the rotated window contained an upright face. The training methods for both networks are presented. Preliminary empirical results are also provided."

If the window contains a face, the router returns the angle of the face. The window can then be \u201cderotated\u201d to make the face upright. The derotated window is then passed to the detection network, which decides whether a face is present. If a non-face image is encountered, the router will return a meaningless rotation. Since a rotation of a non-face image will yield another nonface image, the detector network will still not detect a face. A rotated face, which would not have been detected by an upright face detector, will be rotated to an upright position, and subsequently detected as a face. Because the detector network is only applied once at each image location, this approach is significantly faster than exhaustively trying all orientations, and will yield fewer false detections [ 1,3]. To speed up the above algorithm for demonstration purposes, we used several techniques. First, we use a change detection algorithm to restrict the search area. Second, we use a model of skin color (acquired online as faces are detected) to further restrict the search. Finally, we use a candidate detection network to quickly rule out some portions of the input image, before examining them more carefully (and slowly) with the detection network. With these techniques, it takes about 6 seconds to process a 160x 120 pixel image on an SGI 02 workstation with a 174 MHz RIO000 processor."

We demonstrate our technique in the context of face detection with complex background without color or motion information, which has proven to be a challenging problem. We use a family of discrete Markov processes to model the face and background patterns and estimate the probability models using the data statistics. Then, we convert the learning process into an optimization, selecting the Markov process that optimizes the information-based discrimination between the two classes. The detection process is carried out by computing the likelihood ratio using the probability model obtained from the learning procedure. We show that because of the discrete nature of these models, the detection process is at least two orders of magnitude less computationally expensive than neural network approaches. However, no improvement in terms of correct-answer/false-alarm tradeoff is achieved."

Accurate visual recognition is demonstrated using a database of O(10/sup 3/) faces. The problem of recognition under general viewing orientation is also examined. A view-based multiple-observer eigenspace technique is proposed for use in face recognition under variable pose. In addition, a modular eigenspace description technique is used which incorporates salient features such as the eyes, nose and mouth, in an eigenfeature layer. This modular representation yields higher recognition rates as well as a more robust framework for face recognition. An automatic feature extraction technique using feature eigentemplates is also demonstrated.<<ETX>>"

With technological advance on microelectronic and vision system, high performance automatic techniques on biometric recognition are now becoming economically feasible. Among all the biometric identification methods, face recognition has attracted much attention in recent years because it has potential to be most nonintrusive and user-friendly. The PDBNN face recognition system consists of three modules: First, a face detector finds the location of a human face in an image. Then an eye localizer determines the positions of both eyes in order to generate meaningful feature vectors. The facial region proposed contains eyebrows, eyes, and nose, but excluding mouth (eye-glasses will be allowed). Lastly, the third module is a face recognizer. The PDBNN can be effectively applied to all the three modules. It adopts a hierarchical network structures with nonlinear basis functions and a competitive credit-assignment scheme. The paper demonstrates a successful application of PDBNN to face recognition applications on two public (FERET and ORL) and one in-house (SCR) databases. Regarding the performance, experimental results on three different databases such as recognition accuracies as well as false rejection and false acceptance rates are elaborated. As to the processing speed, the whole recognition process (including PDBNN processing for eye localization, feature extraction, and classification) consumes approximately one second on Sparc10, without using hardware accelerator or co-processor."

This paper introduces the artificial neural network group-based adaptive tolerance (GAT) tree model for translation-invariant face recognition, suitable for use in an airport security system. GAT trees use a two-stage divide-and-conquer tree-type approach. The first stage determines general properties of the input, such as whether the facial image contains glasses or a beard. The second stage identifies the individual. Face perception classification, detection of front faces with glasses and/or beards, and face recognition results using GAT trees under laboratory conditions are presented. We conclude that the neural network group-based model offers significant improvement over conventional neural network trees for this task."

These probability densities are then used to formulate a maximum-likelihood estimation framework for visual search and target detection for automatic object recognition. This learning technique is tested in experiments with modeling and subsequent detection of human faces and non-rigid objects such as hands.<<ETX>>"

Vapnik and his team (AT&T Bell Labs., 1985) that can be seen as a new method for training polynomial, neural network, or Radial Basis Functions classifiers. The decision surfaces are found by solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming problem. This optimization problem is challenging because the quadratic form is completely dense and the memory requirements grow with the square of the number of data points. We present a decomposition algorithm that guarantees global optimality, and can be used to train SVM's over very large data sets. The main idea behind the decomposition is the iterative solution of sub-problems and the evaluation of optimality conditions which are used both to generate improved iterative values, and also establish the stopping criteria for the algorithm. We present experimental results of our implementation of SVM, and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a face detection problem that involves a data set of 50,000 data points."

The key problem in creating a specific flexible model is the computation of pixelwise correspondence between the prototypes, a task done until now in a semiautomatic way. In this paper we describe an algorithm that automatically bootstraps the correspondence between the prototypes. The algorithm -which can be used for 2D images as well as for 3D models-is shown to synthesize successfully a flexible model of frontal face images and a flexible model of handwritten digits."

                "text": "Object and pattern detection is a classical computer vision problem with many potential applications, ranging from automatic target recognition to image-based industrial inspection tasks in assembly lines. While there have been some successful object and pattern detection systems in the past, most such systems handle only specific rigid objects or patterns that can be accurately described by fixed geometric models or pictorial templates. \nThis thesis presents a learning based approach for detecting classes of objects and patterns with variable image appearance but highly predictable image boundaries. Some examples of such object and pattern classes include human faces, aerial views of structured terrain features like volcanoes, localized material defect signatures in industrial parts, certain tissue anomalies in medical images, and instances of a given digit or character, which may be written or printed in many different styles. \nThe thesis consists of two parts. In part one, we introduce our object and pattern detection approach using a concrete human face detection example. The approach first builds a distribution-based model of the target pattern class in an appropriate feature space to describe the target's variable image appearance. It then learns from examples a similarity measure for matching new patterns against the distribution-based target model. We also discuss some pertinent learning issues, including ideas on virtual example generation and example selection. The approach makes few assumptions about the target pattern class and should therefore be fairly general, as long as the target class has predictable image boundaries. We show that this is indeed the case by demonstrating the technique on two other pattern detection/recognition problems. \nBecause our object and pattern detection approach is very much learning-based, how well a system eventually performs depends heavily on the quality of training examples it receives. The second part of this thesis looks at how one can select high quality examples for function approximation learning tasks. Active learning is an area of research that investigates how a learner can intelligently select future training examples to get better approximation results with less data. We propose an active learning formulation for function approximation, and show for three specific approximation function classes, that the active example selection strategy learns its target with fewer data samples than random sampling. Finally, we simplify the original active learning formulation, and show how it leads to a tractable example selection paradigm, suitable for use in many object and pattern detection problems.

In the first step, a rough localisation is performed by presenting each pixel with its neighbourhood to a neural net which is able to indicate whether this pixel and its neighbourhood are the image of the search object. This first filter does not discriminate for position. From its result, areas which might contain an image of the object can be selected. In the second step, these areas are presented to another neural net which can determine the exact position of the object in each area. This algorithm is applied to the problem of localising faces in images."

This book describes a connectionist system called ALVINN (Autonomous Land Vehicle In a Neural Network) that overcomes these difficulties. ALVINN learns to guide mobile robots using the back-propagation training algorithm. Because of its ability to learn from example, ALVINN can adapt to new situations and therefore cope with the diversity of the autonomous navigation task. But real world problems like vision based mobile robot guidance present a different set of challenges for the connectionist paradigm. Among them are: how to develop a general representation from a limited amount of real training data, how to understand the internal representations developed by artificial neural networks, how to estimate the reliability of individual networks, how to combine multiple networks trained for different situations into a single system, and how to combine connectionist perception with symbolic reasoning. Neural Network Perception for Mobile Robot Guidance presents novel solutions to each of these problems. Using these techniques, the ALVINN system can learn to control an autonomous van in under 5 minutes by watching a person drive. Once trained, individual ALVINN networks can drive in a variety of circumstances, including single-lane paved and unpaved roads, and multi-lane lined and unlined roads, at speeds of up to 55 miles per hour. The techniques also are shown to generalize to the task of controlling the precise foot placement of a walking robot."

In this study, an abstraction of the basic genetic algorithm, the Equilibrium Genetic Algorithm (EGA), and the GA in turn, are reconsidered within the framework of competitive learning. This new perspective reveals a number of different possibilities for performance improvements. This paper explores population-based incremental learning (PBIL), a method of combining the mechanisms of a generational genetic algorithm with simple competitive learning. The combination of these two methods reveals a tool which is far simpler than a GA, and which out-performs a GA on large set of optimization problems in terms of both speed and accuracy. This paper presents an empirical analysis of where the proposed technique will outperform genetic algorithms, and describes a class of problems in which a genetic algorithm may be able to perform better. Extensions to this algorithm are discussed and analyzed. PBIL and extensions are compared with a standard GA on twelve problems, including standard numerical optimization functions, traditional GA test suite problems, and NP-Complete problems."
