The system uses a recognition-based segmenter, that is a hybrid of connected-components analysis (CCA), vertical cuts, and a neural network recognizer. Connected components that are single digits are handled by CCA. CCs that are combined or dissected digits are handled by the vertical-cut segmenter. The four main stages of processing are preprocessing, in which noise is removed and the digits are deslanted, CCA segmentation and recognition, vertical-cut-point estimation and segmentation, and directly lookup. The system was trained and tested on approximately 10000 images, five- and nine-digit ZIP code fields taken from real mail.<<ETX>>"

However, their recognition accuracy has been limited by the accuracy of the underlying segmentation algorithm. Conventional, rule-based segmentation algorithms encounter difficulty if the characters are touching, broken, or noisy. The problem in these situations is that often one cannot properly segment a character until it is recognized yet one cannot properly recognize a character until it is segmented. We present here a neural network algorithm that simultaneously segments and recognizes in an integrated system. This algorithm has several novel features: it uses a supervised learning algorithm (backpropagation), but is able to take position-independent information as targets and self-organize the activities of the units in a competitive fashion to infer the positional information. We demonstrate this ability with overlapping handprinted numerals."

One system uses the connectionist Viterbi-training (CVT) procedure, in which a neural network with frame-level outputs is trained using guidance from a time alignment procedure. The other system uses multi-state time-delay neural networks (MS-TDNNs), in which embedded DP time alignment allows network training with only word-level external supervision. The CVT results on the, TI Digits are 99.1% word accuracy and 98.0% string accuracy. The MS-TDNNs are described in detail, with attention focused on their architecture, the training procedure, and results of applying the MS-TDNNs to continuous speaker-dependent alphabet recognition: on two speakers, word accuracy is respectively 97.5% and 89.7%.<<ETX>>"

We wish to treat the outputs of the network as probabilities of alternatives (e.g. pattern classes), conditioned on the inputs. We look for appropriate output non-linearities and for appropriate criteria for adaptation of the parameters of the network (e.g. weights). We explain two modifications: probability scoring, which is an alternative to squared error minimisation, and a normalised exponential (softmax) multi-input generalisation of the logistic non-linearity. The two modifications together result in quite simple arithmetic, and hardware implementation is not difficult either. The use of radial units (squared distance instead of dot product) immediately before the softmax output stage produces a network which computes posterior distributions over class labels based on an assumption of Gaussian within-class distributions. However the training, which uses cross-class information, can result in better performance at class discrimination than the usual within-class training method, unless the within-class distribution assumptions are actually correct."

CVT can be run iteratively and can be applied to large-vocabulary recognition tasks. Successful completion of training the connectionist component of the system, despite the large network size and volume of training data, depends largely on several measures taken to reduce learning time. The system is trained and tested on the TI/NBS speaker-independent continuous-digits database. Performance on test data for unknown-length strings is 98.5% word accuracy and 95.0% string accuracy. Several improvements to the current system are expected to increase these accuracies significantly.<<ETX>>"
