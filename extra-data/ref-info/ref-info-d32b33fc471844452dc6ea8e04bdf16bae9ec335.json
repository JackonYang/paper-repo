In a scheme due to Gabor, an image is represented in terms of localized symmetrical and antisymmetrical elementary signals. Both measured receptive fields and measured spatial frequency tuning curves conform closely to the functional form of Gabor elementary signals. It is argued that the visual cortex representation corresponds closely to the Gabor scheme owing to its advantages in treating the subsequent problem of pattern recognition."

It is shown that images represented by localized phase-only information reproduce adequately the edge relationship while compressing the gray level information, unlike the localized magnitude-only representation that distorts the edge information. We address the issue of the number of quantization levels required for adequate representation by localized phase, and present an analytical expression of the resultant image as well as computational examples. We show that image reconstruction from localized phase-only is more efficient than image reconstruction from global (Fourier) phase in that the number of required computer operations is reduced and the rate of convergence is improved. The computation efficiency can be further improved by implementation of highly- parallel architecture."

                "text": "Two-dimensional spatial linear filters are constrained by general uncertainty relations that limit their attainable information resolution for orientation, spatial frequency, and two-dimensional (2D) spatial position. The theoretical lower limit for the joint entropy, or uncertainty, of these variables is achieved by an optimal 2D filter family whose spatial weighting functions are generated by exponentiated bivariate second-order polynomials with complex coefficients, the elliptic generalization of the one-dimensional elementary functions proposed in Gabor's famous theory of communication [J. Inst. Electr. Eng. 93, 429 (1946)]. The set includes filters with various orientation bandwidths, spatial-frequency bandwidths, and spatial dimensions, favoring the extraction of various kinds of information from an image. Each such filter occupies an irreducible quantal volume (corresponding to an independent datum) in a four-dimensional information hyperspace whose axes are interpretable as 2D visual space, orientation, and spatial frequency, and thus such a filter set could subserve an optimally efficient sampling of these variables. Evidence is presented that the 2D receptive-field profiles of simple cells in mammalian visual cortex are well described by members of this optimal 2D filter family, and thus such visual neurons could be said to optimize the general uncertainty relations for joint 2D-spatial-2D-spectral information resolution. The variety of their receptive-field dimensions and orientation and spatial-frequency bandwidths, and the correlations among these, reveal several underlying constraints, particularly in width/length aspect ratio and principal axis organization, suggesting a polar division of labor in occupying the quantal volumes of information hyperspace.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Particular attention is given to the fact that receptive field profiles of simple cells in the visual cortex often resemble even-symmetric or odd-symmetric Gabor filters; i.e. their receptive field profiles can be described by the product of a Gaussian and either a cosine or sine function. Their spatial frequency tuning is of medium bandwidth (~one octave) which is narrow enough for a cell to distinguish the third harmonic from the fundamental frequency for square-wave gratings of low spatial frequency. The responses of adjacent simple cells, tuned to the same spatial frequency, orientation, and direction, differ in their phase response to drifting sine-wave gratings by approximately either 90\u00b0 or 180\u00b0. This latter result makes it possible to consider two adjacent simple cell pairs as operating like paired Gaussian-attenuated sine and cosine filters of Gabor filters for restricted regions of visual space. The entire set of simple cells provides a complete representation of the visual scene, yet each simple cell is unique in its response properties. At the complex cell stage, the cell's mean firing rate appears to represent the amplitude of a local Fourier coefficient, but phase information is seldom conveyed with much precision in the action potential code."

It is shown that the complex spectrogram is completely determined by its values on the points of a certain time-frequency lattice. This lattice is exactly the one suggested by Gabor in 1946; it arose in connection with Gabor's suggestion to expand a signal into a discrete set of Gaussian elementary signals. Such an expansion is a special case of the more general expansion of a signal into a discrete set of properly shifted and modulated window functions. It is shown that this expansion exists. Furthermore, a set of functions is constructed, which is bi-orthonormal to the set of shifted and modulated window functions. With the help of this bi-orthonormal set of functions, the expansion coefficients can be determined easily."

The representation differs from established techniques in that the code elements are localized in spatial frequency as well as in space. Pixel-to-pixel correlations are first removed by subtracting a lowpass filtered copy of the image from the image itself. The result is a net data compression since the difference, or error, image has low variance and entropy, and the low-pass filtered image may represented at reduced sample density. Further data compression is achieved by quantizing the difference image. These steps are then repeated to compress the low-pass image. Iteration of the process at appropriately expanded scales generates a pyramid data structure. The encoding process is equivalent to sampling the image with Laplacian operators of many scales. Thus, the code tends to enhance salient image features. A further advantage of the present code is that it is well suited for many image analysis tasks as well as for image compression. Fast algorithms are described for coding and decoding."

Insight into some principles of the reorganization and transformations that occur in the early stages of the visual pathway, prior to the higher stages of pattern recognition, is provided through an analysis of receptive fields and cell counts. The rate of information flow is reduced approximately 100-fold by a retinal position-dependent (inhomogeneous) spatial sampling scheme. This principle of specialization, or nonuniform processing, is further elaborated in the retino-cortical mapping. In the central fovea, where the retinal spatial sampling rate is the highest and processing function is uniform, there are about 4000 striate cortical neurons receiving information from each cone. This number, which provides a measure of function multiplicity, drops to about 200 over the range of the near periphery. In the peripheral field beyond eight degrees, where information is compressed at the retina, the functional multiplicity stays approximately constant at 200. As it seems that no two cells perform exactly the same operation, it is concluded that the striate cortex performs many simultaneous functional mappings."

From the complex spectrogram the signal can be reconstructed uniquely. It is shown that the complex spectrogram is completely determined by its values on the points (to=mT, wo=n\u03a9), where \u03a9T= 2tt and m and n take all integer values. The lattice of points (mT,n\u03a9) is exactly the lattice suggested by Gabor as early as 1946; it arose in connection with Gabor's suggestion to expand a signal into a discrete set of Gaussian elementary signals. Such an expansion is a special case of the general expansion \u2211\u2211mn amng(t-mT)exp[in\u03a9t] of a signal into a discrete set of shifted and modulated window functions. It is shown that this expansion exists. Furthermore, a set of functions is constructed, which is bi-orthonormal to the set of shifted and modulated window functions. With the help of this bi-orthonormal set of functions, the expansion coefficients amn can be determined easily."

                "text": "In the Fourier representation of signals, spectral magnitude and phase tend to play different roles and in some situations many of the important features of a signal are preserved if only the phase is retained. Furthermore, under a variety of conditions, such as when a signal is of finite length, phase information alone is sufficient to completely reconstruct a signal to within a scale factor. In this paper, we review and discuss these observations and results in a number of different contexts and applications. Specifically, the intelligibility of phase-only reconstruction for images, speech, and crystallographic structures are illustrated. Several approaches to justifying the relative importance of phase through statistical arguments are presented, along with a number of informal arguments suggesting reasons for the importance of phase. Specific conditions under which a sequence can be exactly reconstructed from phase are reviewed, both for one-dimensional and multi-dimensional sequences, and algorithms for both approximate and exact reconstruction of signals from phase information are presented. A number of applications of the observations and results in this paper are suggested."

The setting consists of two spaces of generalized functions (tempered distributions and \nelements of the class S*) which appear in a natural way in the context of the Bargmann \ntransform.

We present quantitative results of theoretical studies on propagation of plane waves for normal incidence, through perfectly elastic multilayered media. As wavelet shapes, we use zero-phase cosine wavelets modulated by a Gaussian envelope and the corresponding complex wavelets. A finite set of such wavelets, for an appropriate sampling of the frequency domain, may be taken as the basic wavelets for a Gabor expansion of any signal or trace in a two-dimensional (2-D) domain (time and frequency). We can then compute the wave propagation using complex functions and thereby obtain quantitative results including energy and phase of the propagating signals. These results appear as complex 2-D functions of time and frequency, i.e., as \u201cinstantaneous frequency spectra. \u2019 \u2019 Choosing a constant sampling rate on the logarithmic scale in the frequency domain leads to an appropriate sampling method for phase preservation of the complex signals or traces. For this purpose, we developed a Gabor expansion involving basic wavelets with a constant time duration/mean period ratio. For layered media, as found in sedimentary basins,"

In the striate cortex, the anatomical substrate for retinotopic organization is surprisingly well ordered, and there seems to be a systematic relationship between ocular dominance strips and cortical magnification. The 2-deoxyglucose maps in this area appear to be largely uninfluenced by known differences in long-term metabolic activity. This method should prove useful in analyzing retinotopic organization in various visual areas of the brain and in different species."

We simulated the theoretical tools we present here, using the Goupillaud-Kunetz algorithm. Now we present sampling methods for complex signals or traces corresponding to received waves, and sampling methods for complex characterization of multilayered or heterogeneous media. Regarding the complex signals, we present a twodimecsional(2-D) method of sampling in the time-frequency domain using a special or \u201cextended\u201d Gabor expansion on a set of basic wavelets adapted to phase preservation. Such a 2-D expansion permits us to handle in a proper manner instantaneous frequency spectra. We show the differences between \u201cwavelet resolution\u201d and \u201csampling grid resolution.\u201d We also show the importance of phase preservation in high-resolution seismic. Regarding the media, we show how analytical studies of wave propagation in periodic structured layers could help when trying to characterize the physical properties of the layers and their large scale granularity as a result of complex deconvolution. Analytical studies of wave propagation in periodic structures are well known in solid state physics, and lead to the so-called \u201cBloch waves.\u201d The introduction of complex waves leads to replacing the classical wave equation by a Schriidinger equation. Finally, we show that complex wave equations, Gabor expansion, and Bloch waves are three different ways of \u2018introducing the tools of quantum mechanics in highresolution seismic (Gabor, 1946; Kittel, 1976, Morlet, 1975). And conversely, the Goupillaud-Kunetz algorithm and an extended Gabor expansion may be of some use in solid state physics."

The method combines aspects of the semiclassical nature of vibrational motion and variational, ab initio techniques. Localized complex Gaussian wave functions, whose parameters are chosen according to classical phase space criteria are employed in standard numerical basis set diagonalization routines. The Gaussians are extremely convenient as regards construction of Hamiltonian matrix elements, computation of derived properties such as Franck\u2013Condon factors, and interpretation of results in terms of classical motion. The basis set is not tied to any zeroth order Hamiltonian and is readily adaptable to arbitrary smooth potentials of any dimension."

The newest simulators used in military training programs include cockpits for flight training; portable desktop videodiscs for practicing command, maintenance, and routine operations on land, at sea, and in the air; microcomputer-driven war games that teach tactics; and laser weapons for battle simulation. Among the technologies reviewed to improve realism and cut costs in these four areas are computer graphics, fiber optics, videodiscs, distributed processing, and very high-speed integrated circuits."
