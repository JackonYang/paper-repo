The method employs a convolutional network to map face images to points on a manifold, parametrized by pose, and non-face images to points far from that manifold. This network is trained by optimizing a loss function of three variables: image, pose, and face/non-face label. We test the resulting system, in a single configuration, on three standard data sets - one for frontal pose, one for rotated faces, and one for profiles - and find that its performance on each set is comparable to previous multi-view face detectors that can only handle one form of pose variation. We also show experimentally that the system's accuracy on both face detection and pose estimation is improved by training for the two tasks together."

Especially, using landmark localization for geometric face normalization has shown to be very effective, clearly improving the recognition results. However, no adequate databases exist that provide a sufficient number of annotated facial landmarks. The databases are either limited to frontal views, provide only a small number of annotated images or have been acquired under controlled conditions. Hence, we introduce a novel database overcoming these limitations: Annotated Facial Landmarks in the Wild (AFLW). AFLW provides a large-scale collection of images gathered from Flickr, exhibiting a large variety in face appearance (e.g., pose, expression, ethnicity, age, gender) as well as general imaging and environmental conditions. In total 25,993 faces in 21,997 real-world images are annotated with up to 21 landmarks per image. Due to the comprehensive set of annotations AFLW is well suited to train and test algorithms for multi-view face detection, facial landmark localization and face pose estimation. Further, we offer a rich set of tools that ease the integration of other face databases and associated annotations into our joint framework."

We describe a general, flexible mixture model for capturing contextual co-occurrence relations between parts, augmenting standard spring models that encode spatial relations. We show that such relations can capture notions of local rigidity. When co-occurrence and spatial relations are tree-structured, our model can be efficiently optimized with dynamic programming. We present experimental results on standard benchmarks for pose estimation that indicate our approach is the state-of-the-art system for pose estimation, outperforming past work by 50% while being orders of magnitude faster."

In this work, we address both of these issues. We present a new data set of face images with more faces and more accurate annotations for face regions than in previous data sets. We also propose two rigorous and precise methods for evaluating the performance of face detection algorithms. We report results of several standard algorithms on the new benchmark."

However, many reported methods assume that the faces in an image or an image sequence have been identified and localized. To build fully automated systems that analyze the information contained in face images, robust and efficient face detection algorithms are required. Given a single image, the goal of face detection is to identify all image regions which contain a face, regardless of its 3D position, orientation and lighting conditions. Such a problem is challenging because faces are non-rigid and have a high degree of variability in size, shape, color and texture. Numerous techniques have been developed to detect faces in a single image, and the purpose of this paper is to categorize and evaluate these algorithms. We also discuss relevant issues such as data collection, evaluation metrics and benchmarking. After analyzing these algorithms and identifying their limitations, we conclude with several promising directions for future research."

The model consists of a set of sparse 3D points and the view-based patches associated with every point. Assuming a weak perspective projection model, our algorithm iteratively deforms the model and ad- justs the 3D pose to fit the image. As opposed to previous approaches, our algorithm starts the fitting without resort- ing to manual labeling of key facial points. And it makes no assumptions about global illumination or surface prop- erties, so it can be applied to a wide range of imaging con- ditions. Experiments demonstrate that our approach can effectively handle unseen faces with a variety of pose and illumination variations."

The model is fitted to an unseen image in an iterative manner by generating templates using the joint model and the current parameter estimates, correlating the templates with the target image to generate response images and optimising the shape parameters so as to maximise the sum of responses. The appearance model is similar to that used in the Active Appearance Model due to Cootes et al. However in our approach the appearance model is used to generate likely feature templates, instead of trying to approximate the image pixels directly. We show that when applied to human faces, our constrained local model (CLM) algorithm is more robust and more accurate than the original AAM search method, which relies on the image reconstruction error to update the model parameters. We demonstrate improved localisation accuracy on two publicly available face data sets and improved tracking on a challenging set of in-car face sequences."

As a result, numerous approaches have been proposed with varying degrees of success. A class of approaches that has shown substantial promise is one that makes independent predictions regarding locations of the model\u2019s landmarks, which are combined by enforcing a prior over their joint motion. A common theme in innovations to this approach is the replacement of the distribution of probable landmark locations, obtained from each local detector, with simpler parametric forms. In this work, a principled optimization strategy is proposed where nonparametric representations of these likelihoods are maximized within a hierarchy of smoothed estimates. The resulting update equations are reminiscent of mean-shift over the landmarks but with regularization imposed through a global prior over their joint motion. Extensions to handle partial occlusions and reduce computational complexity are also presented. Through numerical experiments, this approach is shown to outperform some common existing methods on the task of generic face fitting."

To reduce the search required for detection, we employ the bottom-up approach where we find candidate image features and associate some of them with parts of the object model. We represent objects as collections of local features, and would like to allow any of them to be absent, with only a small subset sufficient for detection;furthermore, our model should allow efficient correspondence search. We propose a model, Mixture of Trees, that achieves these goals. With a mixture of trees, we can model the individual appearances of the features, relationships among them, and the aspect, and handle occlusions. Independences captured in the model make efficient inference possible. In our earlier work, we have shown that mixtures of trees can be used to model objects with a natural tree structure, in the context of human tracking. Now we show that a natural tree structure is not required, and use a mixture of trees for both frontal and view-invariant face detection. We also show that by modeling faces as collections of features we can establish an intrinsic coordinate frame for a face, and estimate the out-of-plane rotation of a face."

The estimate is achieved by fitting a statistical, morphable model of 3D faces to images. The model is learned from a set of textured 3D scans of heads. We describe the construction of the morphable model, an algorithm to fit the model to images, and a framework for face identification. In this framework, faces are represented by model parameters for 3D shape and texture.

                "text": "Abstract This paper extends the face detection framework proposedby Viola and Jones 2001 to handle pro\ufb01le views and rotatedfaces. As in the work of Rowley et al 1998. and Schneider-man et al. 2000, we build different detectors for differentviews of the face. A decision tree is then trained to deter-mine the viewpoint class (such as right pro\ufb01le or rotated60 degrees) for a given window of the image being exam-ined. This is similar to the approach of Rowley et al. 1998.The appropriate detector for that viewpoint can then be runinstead of running all detectors on all windows. This tech-niqueyields goodresults and maintainsthe speed advantageof the Viola-Jones detector. 1. Introduction There are a number of techniques that can successfullydetect frontal upright faces in a wide variety of images[11, 7, 10, 12, 3, 6]. While the de\ufb01nition of \u201cfrontal\u201d and\u201cupright\u201dmayvaryfromsystem to system, the reality is thatmany natural images contain rotated or pro\ufb01le faces thatare not reliably detected. There are a small number of sys-tems which explicitly address non-frontal, or non-uprightface detection [8, 10, 2]. This paper describes progress to-ward a system which can detect faces regardless of posereliably and in real-time.This paperextendsthe frameworkproposedby Viola andJones [12]. This approach is selected because of its compu-tational ef\ufb01ciency and simplicity.One observation which is shared among all previous re-lated work is that a multi-view detector must be carefullyconstructed by combining a collection of detectors eachtrained for a single viewpoint. It appears that a monolithicapproach, where a single classi\ufb01er is trained to detect allposes of a face, is unlearnable with existing classi\ufb01ers. Ourinformal experiments lend support to this conclusion, sincea classi\ufb01er trained on all poses appears to be hopelessly in-accurate.This paper addresses two types of pose variation: non-frontal faces, which are rotated out of the image plane, andnon-upright faces, which are rotated in the image plane.In both cases the multi-view detector presented in this pa-per is a combination of Viola-Jones detectors, each detectortrained on face data taken from a single viewpoint.Reliable non-upright face detection was \ufb01rst presentedin a paper by Rowley, Baluja and Kanade [8]. They traintwo neural network classi\ufb01ers. The \ufb01rst estimates the poseof a face in the detection window. The second is a conven-tional face detector. Faces are detected in three steps: foreach image window the pose of \u201cface\u201d is \ufb01rst estimated; thepose estimate is then used to de-rotate the image window;the window is then classi\ufb01ed by the second detector. Fornon-face windows, the poses estimate must be consideredrandom. Nevertheless, a rotated non-faceshouldbe rejectedby the conventional detector. One potential \ufb02aw of such asystem is that the \ufb01nal detection rate is roughly the productof the correct classi\ufb01cation rates of the two classi\ufb01ers (sincethe errors of the two classi\ufb01ers are somewhat independent).One could adopt the Rowley et al. three step approachwhile replacingthe classi\ufb01ers with those of Viola andJones.The \ufb01nal system would be more ef\ufb01cient, but not signi\ufb01-cantly. Classi\ufb01cation by the Viola-Jones system is so ef\ufb01-cient, that derotation would dominate the computational ex-pense. In principle derotation is not strictly necessary sinceit should be possible to construct a detector for rotated facesdirectly. Detection becomes a two stage process. First thepose of the window is estimated and then one ofrotationspeci\ufb01c detectors is called upon to classify the window.In this paper detection of non-upright faces is handledusing the two stage approach. In the \ufb01rst stage the pose ofeach window is estimated using a decision tree constructedusing features like those described by Viola and Jones. Inthe second stage one ofpose speci\ufb01c Viola-Jones dete-tectors are used to classify the window.Oncepose speci\ufb01c detectors are trained and available,an alternative detection process can be tested as well. In thiscase alldetectors are evaluated and the union of their de-"

However, the cues available for recognizing a 300 pixel tall object are qualitatively different from those for recognizing a 3 pixel tall object. We argue that for sensors with finite resolution, one should instead use scale-variant, or multiresolution representations that adapt in complexity to the size of a putative detection window. We describe a multiresolution model that acts as a deformable part-based model when scoring large instances and a rigid template with scoring small instances. We also examine the interplay of resolution and context, and demonstrate that context is most helpful for detecting low-resolution instances when local models are limited in discriminative power. We demonstrate impressive results on the Caltech Pedestrian benchmark, which contains object instances at a wide range of scales. Whereas recent state-of-the-art methods demonstrate missed detection rates of 86%-37% at 1 false-positive-per-image, our multiresolution model reduces the rate to 29%."

The CMU PIE database has been very influential in advancing research in face recognition across pose and illumination. Despite its success the PIE database has several shortcomings: a limited number of subjects, a single recording session and only few expressions captured. To address these issues we collected the CMU Multi-PIE database. It contains 337 subjects, imaged under 15 view points and 19 illumination conditions in up to four recording sessions. In this paper we introduce the database and describe the recording procedure. We furthermore present results from baseline experiments using PCA and LDA classifiers to highlight similarities and differences between PIE and Multi-PIE."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

The model offers a high degree of learnt invariance by utilizing viewpoint-dependent mixture components and movable parts in each mixture component. One might hope to increase the accuracy of the DPM by increasing the number of mixture components and parts to give a more faithful model, but limited training data prevents this from being effective. We propose an extension to the DPM which allows for sharing of object part models among multiple mixture components as well as object classes. This results in more compact models and allows training examples to be shared by multiple components, ameliorating the effect of a limited size training set. We (i) reformulate the DPM to incorporate part sharing, and (ii) propose a novel energy function allowing for coupled training of mixture components and object classes. We report state-of-the-art results on the PASCAL VOC dataset."

Traditional approaches require applying a battery of different classifiers to the image, at multiple locations and scales. This can be slow and can require a lot of training data since each classifier requires the computation of many different image features. In particular, for independently trained detectors, the (runtime) computational complexity and the (training-time) sample complexity scale linearly with the number of classes to be detected. We present a multitask learning procedure, based on boosted decision stumps, that reduces the computational and sample complexity by finding common features that can be shared across the classes (and/or views). The detectors for each class are trained jointly, rather than independently. For a given performance level, the total number of features required and, therefore, the runtime cost of the classifier, is observed to scale approximately logarithmically with the number of classes. The features selected by joint training are generic edge-like features, whereas the features chosen by training each class separately tend to be more object-specific. The generic features generalize better and considerably reduce the computational cost of multiclass object detection"

Although linear in both shape and appearance, overall, AAMs are nonlinear parametric models in terms of the pixel intensities. Fitting an AAM to an image consists of minimising the error between the input image and the closest model instance; i.e. solving a nonlinear optimisation problem. We propose an efficient fitting algorithm for AAMs based on the inverse compositional image alignment algorithm. We show that the effects of appearance variation during fitting can be precomputed (\u201cprojected out\u201d) using this algorithm and how it can be extended to include a global shape normalising warp, typically a 2D similarity transformation. We evaluate our algorithm to determine which of its novel aspects improve AAM fitting performance."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

At least two reasons account for this trend: the first is the wide range of commercial and law enforcement applications, and the second is the availability of feasible technologies after 30 years of research. Even though current machine recognition systems have reached a certain level of maturity, their success is limited by the conditions imposed by many real applications. For example, recognition of face images acquired in an outdoor environment with changes in illumination and/or pose remains a largely unsolved problem. In other words, current systems are still far away from the capability of the human perception system.This paper provides an up-to-date critical survey of still- and video-based face recognition research. There are two underlying motivations for us to write this survey paper: the first is to provide an up-to-date review of the existing literature, and the second is to offer some insights into the studies of machine recognition of faces. To provide a comprehensive survey, we not only categorize existing recognition techniques but also present detailed descriptions of representative methods within each category. In addition, relevant topics such as psychophysical studies, system evaluation, and issues of illumination and pose variation are covered."

A retinally connected neural network examines small windows of an image and decides whether each window contains a face. The system arbitrates between multiple networks to improve performance over a single network. We use a bootstrap algorithm for training the networks, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art face detection systems are presented; our system has better performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates."

Our work is motivated by the pictorial structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager. The basic idea is to represent an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems. We address the problem of using pictorial structure models to find instances of an object in an image as well as the problem of learning an object model from training examples, presenting efficient algorithms in both cases. We demonstrate the techniques by learning models that represent faces and human bodies and using the resulting models to locate the corresponding objects in novel images."

This is tremendously challenging due to the huge variation in imaged appearance of each character and the weakness and ambiguity of available annotation. However, we demonstrate that high precision can be achieved by combining multiple sources of information, both visual and textual. The principal novelties that we introduce are: (i) automatic generation of time stamped character annotation by aligning subtitles and transcripts; (ii) strengthening the supervisory information by identifying when characters are speaking; (iii) using complementary cues of face matching and clothing matching to propose common annotations for face tracks. Results are presented on episodes of the TV series \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d."
