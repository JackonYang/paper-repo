A characteristic which makes them resemble certain biological brain maps, however, is the spatial order of their responses which is formed in the learning process. Two innovations are discussed: dynamic weighting of the input signals at each input of each cell, which improves the ordering when very different input signals are used, and definition of neighborhoods in the learning algorithm by the minimum spanning tree, which provides a far better and faster approximation of prominently structured density functions. It is cautioned that if the maps are used for pattern recognition and decision processes, it is necessary to fine-tune the reference vectors such that they directly define the decision borders.<<ETX>>"

During learning each module learns a function, which is adjusted such as to minimize the average square error between the correct function and the function represented by the network. Although this is a single-layer system, the capability of each module to learn an arbitrary nonlinearity gives the system far more flexibility than a perceptron. At the same time, for output nonlinearities that are a product or a sum of monotonous functions of their arguments there is a unique minimum to which the system is guaranteed to converge.<<ETX>>"

Thus the author prescribes a vector quantizer by minimizing an L/sub 2/ reconstruction distortion measure. He includes in this distribution a contribution from the effect of code noise which corrupts the output of the vector quantizer. Such code noise models the expected distorting effect of later stages of processing, and thus provides a convenient way of ensuring that the vector quantizer acquires a useful coding scheme. The neighborhood updating scheme of Kohonen's self-organizing neural network emerges as a special case of this code noise model. This reformulation of Kohonen's algorithm provides a simple interpretation of the role of the neighborhood update scheme which is used.<<ETX>>"

The results of a series of benchmarking studies based upon artificial statistical pattern recognition tasks indicate that the proposed architecture performs significantly better than do conventional feedforward classifier networks when the decision regions are disjoint. This is attributed to the fact that the self-organization process allows internal units in the succeeding classifier network to be sensitive to a specific set of features in the input space at the outset of training.<<ETX>>"

                "text": "Recent experimental evidence from the somatosensory, auditory, and visual systems documents the existence of functional plasticity in topographic map organization in adult animals. This evidence suggests that an ongoing competitive organizing process controls the locations of map borders and the receptive field properties of neurons. A computer model based on the process of neuronal group selection has been constructed that accounts for reported results on map plasticity in somatosensory cortex. The simulations construct a network of locally connected excitatory and inhibitory cells that receives topographic projections from 2 receptor sheets corresponding to the glabrous and dorsal surfaces of the hand (a typical simulation involves approximately 1500 cells, 70,000 intrinsic and 100,000 extrinsic connections). Both intrinsic and extrinsic connections undergo activity- dependent modifications according to a synaptic rule based on heterosynaptic interactions. Repeated stimulation of the receptor sheet resulted in the formation of neuronal groups-local sets of strongly interconnected neurons in the network. Cells in most groups were found to have similar receptive fields: they were exclusively glabrous or dorsal despite equal numbers of anatomical connections from both surfaces. The sharpness of map borders was due to the sharpness of the underlying group structure; shifts in the locations of these borders resulted from competition between groups. Following perturbations of the input, the network underwent changes similar to those observed experimentally in monkey somatosensory cortex. Repeated local tapping on the receptor sheet resulted in a large increase in the magnification factor of the stimulated region. Transection of the connections from a glabrous region resulted in the organization of a new representation of corresponding dorsal region. The detailed simulations provide several insights into the mechanisms of such changes, as well as a series of predictions about cortical behavior for further experimental test."

                "text": "The nervous system performs computations to process information that is biologically important. Some of these computations occur in maps--arrays of neurons in which the tuning of neighboring neurons for a particular parameter value varies systematically. Computational maps transform the representation of information into a place-coded probability distribution that represents the computed values of parameters by sites of maximum relative activity. Numerous computational maps have been discovered, including visual maps of line orientation and direction of motion, auditory maps of amplitude spectrum and time interval, and motor maps of orienting movements. The construction of the auditory map of space is the most thoroughly understood: information about interaural delays and interaural intensity differences is processed in parallel by separate computational maps, and the outputs of these maps feed into a higher order processor that integrates sets of cues corresponding to sound source locations and creates a map of auditory space. Computational maps represent ranges of parameter values that are relevant to the animal, and may differentially magnify the representation of values that are of particular importance. The tuning of individual neurons for values of a mapped parameter is broad relative to the range of the map. Consequently, neurons throughout a large portion of a computational map are activated by any given stimulus, and precise information about the mapped parameter is coded by the locations of peak activity. There are a number of advantages of performing computations in maps. First, information is processed rapidly because the computations are preset and are executed in parallel. Second, maps simplify the schemes of connectivity required for processing and utilizing the information. Third, a common, mapped representation of the results of different kinds of computations allows the nervous system to employ a single strategy for reading the information. Finally, maps enable several classes of neuronal mechanisms to sharpen tuning in a manner not possible for information that is represented in a non-topographic code."

Topographically ordered mappings, found widely in nervous systems, are those in which neighbouring elements in one sheet of cells project to neighbouring elements in a second sheet. Exploiting this neighbourhood property leads to a new theory for the establishment of topographical mappings, in which the distance between two cells is expressed in terms of their similarity with respect to certain physical properties assigned to them. This topographical code can be realized in a model employing either synchronization of nervous activity or exchange of specific molecules between neighbouring cells. By means of modifiable synapses the code is used to set up a topographical mapping between two sheets with the same internal structure. We have investigated the neural activity version. Without needing to make any elaborate assumptions about its structure or about the operations its elements are to carry out we have shown that the mappings are set up in a system-to-system rather than a cell-to-cell fashion. The pattern of connections develops in a step-by-step and orderly fashion, the orientation of the mappings being laid down in the earliest stages of development."

To initiate such movements with a desired starting velocity u requires knowledge of the relation between torque pulse and desired velocity of the limb. We show for a planar two-link arm model that this relationship can be learnt with the aid of a self-organizing mapping of the type proposed earlier by Kohonen. To this end we extend Kohonen\u2019s algorithm by a suitable learning rule for the individual units and show that this approach results in a significant improvement in the convergency properties of the learning rule used."

The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices."

                "text": "This paper examines the idea that ordered patterns of nerve connections are set up by means of markers carried by the individual cells. The case of the ordered retinotectal projection in amphibia and fishes is discussed in great detail. It is suggested that retinotectal mappings are the result of two mechanisms acting in concert. One mechanism induces a set of retinal markers into the tectum. By this means, an initially haphazard pattern of synapses is transformed into a continuous or piece-wise continuous projection. The other mechanism places the individual pieces of the map in the correct orientation. The machinery necessary for this inductive scheme has been expressed in terms of a set of differential equations, which have been solved numerically for a number of cases. Straightforward assumptions are made as to how markers are distributed in the retina; how they are induced into the tectum; and how the induced markers bring about alterations in the pattern of synaptic contacts. A detailed physiological interpretation of the model is given. The inductive mechanism has been formulated at the level of the individual synaptic interactions. Therefore, it is possible to specify, in a given situation, not only the nature of the end state of the mapping but also how the mapping develops over time. The role of the modes of growth of retina and tectum in shaping the developing projection becomes clear. Since, on this model, the tectum is initially devoid of markers, there is an important difference between the development and the regeneration of ordered mappings. In the development of duplicate maps from various types of compound-eyes, it is suggested that the tectum, rather than the retina, contains an abnormal distribution of markers. An important parameter in these experiments, and also in the regeneration experiments where part-duplication has been found, is the range of interaction amongst the retinal cells. It is suggested that the results of many of the regeneration experiments (including apparently contradictory ones) are manifestations of a conflict between the two alternative ways of specifying the orientation of the map: through the information carried by the markers previously induced into the tectum and through the orientation mechanism itself."

The scheme is generalized to account for the position-dependent Gabor-sampling rate, oversampling, logarithmic frequency scaling and phase-quantization characteristic of the visual system. Comparison of reconstructed signal highlights the advantages of the generalized Gabor scheme in coding typical bandlimited images. It is shown that there exists a tradeoff between the number of frequency components used per position and the number of such clusters (sampling rate) utilized along the spatial coordinate. >"

Based upon the best\u2010frequency distribution, the auditory region was divided into four complete and orderly tonotopic representations and a surrounding belt of cortex in which the tonotopic organization was more complex. The four auditory fields occupy a crescent\u2010shaped band of tissue which comprises portions of both the exposed gyral surfaces and sulcal banks of the ectosylvian cortex. The anterior auditory field (A) is situated most rostrally upon the anterior ectosylvian gyrus. It extends upon the ventral bank of the suprasylvian sulcus and upon the banks of the anterior ectosylvian sulcus. Adjoining field A caudally is the primary auditory field (AI), which extends across the middle ectosylvian gyrus and portions of both banks of the posterior ectosylvian sulcus. The representations of the highest best frequencies in fields A and AI are contiguous. Caudal and ventral to AI are located the posterior (P) and ventroposterior (VP) auditory fields. They lie mainly upon the caudal bank of the posterior ectosylvian sulcus but also extend upon the rostral bank and upon the posterior ectosylvian gyrus. The low best\u2010frequency representations of fields AI and P are contiguous, whereas the low best\u2010frequency representation of field VP lies near the ventral end of the posterior ectosylvian sulcus. Fields P and VP are joined along their middle and high best\u2010frequency representations. Within each auditory field isofrequency lines defined by the spatial loci of neurons with similar best frequencies are oriented orthogonal to the low\u2010to\u2010high best\u2010frequency gradients."

This method is based on activity-dependent intrinsic signals and does not use voltage-sensitive dyes. Images of the living monkey striate (VI) and extrastriate (V2) visual cortex, taken during visual stimulation, were analyzed to yield maps of the distribution of cells with various functional properties. The cytochrome oxidase--rich blobs of V1 and the stripes of V2 were imaged in the living brain. In V2, no ocular dominance organization was seen, while regions of poor orientation tuning colocalized to every other cytochrome oxidase stripe. The orientation tuning of other regions of V2 appeared organized as modules that are larger and more uniform than those in V1."

The key limitation of existing techniques is the very large randomly generated code books which must be stored, and the computational complexity of the associated encoding procedures. The quantization operation is decomposed into its rudimentary structural components. This leads to a simple and elegant approach to derive analytical properties of optimal quantizers. Some useful properties of quantizers and algorithmic approaches are given, which are relevant to the complexity of both storage and processing in the encoding operation. Highly disordered quantizers, which have been designed using a clustering algorithm, are considered. Finally, lattice quantizers are examined which circumvent the need for a code book by using a highly structured code based on lattices. The code vectors are algorithmically generated in a simple manner rather than stored in a code book, and fast algorithms perform the encoding algorithm with negligible complexity."

As a recognition task, the speaker-dependent recognition of the phonemes B, D, and G in varying phonetic contexts was chosen. For comparison, several discrete hidden Markov models (HMM) were trained to perform the same task. Performance evaluation over 1946 testing tokens from three speakers showed that the TDNN achieves a recognition rate of 98.5% correct while the rate obtained by the best of the HMMs was only 93.7%. >"

A common peri-Sylvian cortex for motor and language functions is identified in the language dominant hemisphere, including sites common to sequencing of movements and identification of phonemes that may represent an anatomic substrate for the \u201cmotor theory of speech perception.\u201d This is surrounded by sites related to short-term verbal memory, with sites specialized for such language functions as naming or syntax at the interface between these motor and memory areas. Language functions are discretely and differentially localized in association cortex, including some differential localization of the same function, naming, in multiple languages. There is substantial individual variability in the exact location of sites related to a particular function, a variability which can be partly related to the patient's sex and overall language ability and which may depend on prior brain injury and, perhaps subtly, on prior experience. A common \u201cspecific alerting response\u201d mechanism for motor and language functions is identified in the lateral thalamus of the language\u2013dominant hemisphere, a mechanism that may select the cortical areas appropriate for a particular language function."

A set of chemical markers that express the neighborhood relationships within the presynaptic sheet is induced by the fibers into the postsynaptic sheet. The markers are used to guide the fibers to their terminal sites. A case for which this idea may be relevant is the retinotectal projection; our model exhibits types of plasticity found experimentally. The fact that the postsynaptic markers remain after removal of the projecting fibers suggests an important difference between development and regeneration. This paper concentrates on explaining the basic idea, and in addition presents a set of preliminary computer simulations."

This is followed by a detailed discussion of three issues not treated in the literature: alternatives to the Baum-Welch algorithm; critical facets of the implementation of the algorithms, with emphasis on their numerical properties; and behavior of Markov models on certain artificial but realistic problems. Special attention is given to a particular class of Markov models, which we call \u201cleft-to-right\u201d models. This class of models is especially appropriate for isolated word recognition. The results of the application of these methods to an isolated word, speaker-independent speech recognition experiment are given in a companion paper."

                "text": "The paper describes a model of competition that explains the formation of the ocular dominance stripes found in layer IVc of cat and monkey visual cortex. The main proposal is that synapses exert effects on the growth of other synapses, and that these effects extend over distances of at least 600 \u03bcm and vary in magnitude and sign within this distance. Interactions between like type synapses are assumed to be stimulating for distances up to about 200 \u03bcm, and inhibitory for distances of 200-600 \u03bcm. The reverse is true of interactions between synapses of opposite eye type, where the effects are inhibitory for distances up to about 200 \u03bcm and stimulating for longer ones. The interactions are assumed to be circularly symmetric. Growth of, for example, right eye synapses at one point will therefore (a) encourage local growth of right eye synapses and inhibit local growth of left eye synapses and (b) encourage growth of left eye synapses and inhibit growth of right eye synapses in an annular ring surrounding the point of initial increase. At the start of development, right and left eye synapses are assumed to be intermixed randomly within layer IVc. Computer simulations show that a wide variety of conditions incorporating these assumptions will lead to the formation of stripe patterns. These reproduce many of the morphological features of monkey ocular dominance stripes, including Y- and \u041d-type branches and terminations, the tendency for stripes to run at right angles into the boundaries of the pattern, and to narrow at branch points. The model can explain the effects of monocular deprivation on stripe morphology if it is assumed that the effectiveness of deprived eye synapses in determining rates of growth locally is reduced. The existence of a critical period for these effects can be explained if it is assumed that lateral growth of terminals does not occur, and that some factor such as a limited availability of postsynaptic sites decreases the rate of growth of synapses as their density approaches a maximum. The model can be generalized to account for pattern formation in other systems, such as zebra or mackerel skin, where similar striped patterns occur. In this context, the simplest model based on diffusion that will produce a pattern of stripes requires that one cell type should secrete two substances, one of which stimulates growth or differentiation of its parent cell type and has a low rate of diffusion or is rapidly inactivated, and another that inhibits growth or differentiation and either has a higher rate of diffusion or is less rapidly inactivated. A preliminary account of some of these results has appeared elsewhere (Swindale 1979)."

Clinical neurologists have long been aware that knowledge of particular classes or categories of information may be selectively impaired in some cases and selectively spared in others. For example, knowledge of letters, colours, objects, or people may be lost as a consequence of damage to the left hemisphere of the brain1\u20134. Recently there has been quantitative evidence for even more specific impairment and preservation of particular classes of knowledge5\u20138. More recently the evidence for knowledge of living things as compared with inanimate objects is particularly striking9\u201312. Such observations have suggested that our semantic knowledge base is categorical in its organization. In this preliminary report, we describe a patient whose semantic knowledge deficit was not only category specific, but also modality specific. Although his knowledge of the visual world was almost entirely normal, his knowledge of living things (but not objects!) was gravely impaired when assessed in the verbal domain. These findings call into question the widely accepted view that the brain has a single all-purpose meaning store13."

These neurons are relatively rare in the inferior temporal visual cortex, area TE, but are more common in the cortex in the middle and anterior parts of the superior temporal sulcus. In some cases these neurons can respond to parts of faces such as the eyes, and in other cases a fuller complement of the features present in faces, with even the correct configuration of these features, appears to be necessary for these neurons to respond. In experiments to investigate whether the responses of these neurons would be useful for recognition of an individual, it has been shown that in many cases (77% of one sample), these neurons are sensitive to differences between faces. In experiments designed to investigate the information required for these neurons to respond, it has been shown that these neurons can respond to blurred images of faces, and to faces with only the high spatial frequencies included. A population of neurons with face-selective responses has also been found in the amygdala, which receives inputs from the temporal lobe visual cortex. In many cases these neurons respond differently to different faces. It is suggested that the importance of this type of neuron may be in the different emotional and social responses which occur to different faces, and which are disrupted by damage to the amygdala."

We describe how a parallel analogue algorithm, derived from a formal model2\u20133 for the establishment of topographically ordered projections in the brain4\u201310, can be applied to the travelling salesman problem1,11,12. Using an iterative procedure, a circular closed path is gradually elongated non-uniformly until it eventually passes sufficiently near to all the cities to define a tour. This produces shorter tour lengths than another recent parallel analogue algorithm13, scales well with the size of the problem, and is naturally extendable to a large class of optimization problems involving topographic mappings between geometrical structures14."

The independent quantization of each signal value or parameter is termed scalar quantization, while the joint quantization of a block of parameters is termed block or vector quantization. This tutorial review presents the basic concepts employed in vector quantization and gives a realistic assessment of its benefits and costs when compared to scalar quantization. Vector quantization is presented as a process of redundancy removal that makes effective use of four interrelated properties of vector parameters: linear dependency (correlation), nonlinear dependency, shape of the probability density function (pdf), and vector dimensionality itself. In contrast, scalar quantization can utilize effectively only linear dependency and pdf shape. The basic concepts are illustrated by means of simple examples and the theoretical limits of vector quantizer performance are reviewed, based on results from rate-distortion theory. Practical issues relating to quantizer design, implementation, and performance in actual applications are explored. While many of the methods presented are quite general and can be used for the coding of arbitrary signals, this paper focuses primarily on the coding of speech signals and parameters."

These patients, selected on the basis of a failure to recognize or identify common objects (agnosia for objects), were investigated in detail. In particular, their perceptual, language and memory functions were assessed, and the limits and properties of their recognition difficulties explored. It was found that knowledge of pictorial representations of objects, and of words, was impaired or impoverished, and in both instances knowledge of subordinate categories was more vulnerable than superordinate categories. Evidence is presented that this impairment of semantic memory cannot be accounted for by intellectual impairment, sensory or perceptual deficits, or expressive language disorder. The implications of damage to the semantic memory system for the operation of other cognitive systems, in particular short and long-term memory functions, are considered. Some tentative evidence for the structural basis for a hierarchically organized modality-specific semantic memory system is discussed."

A correct recognition rate of 97.7% was achieved by a single, larger LVQ2 network covering all Japanese consonants. These recognition results are at least as high as those obtained in the time delay neural network system and suggest that LVQ2 could be the basis for a successful speech recognition system.<<ETX>>"

These neurons are relatively rare in the inferior temporal visual cortex, area TE, but are more common in the cortex in the middle and anterior parts of the superior temporal sulcus. In some cases these neurons can respond to parts of faces such as the eyes, and in other cases a fuller complement of the features present in faces, with even the correct configuration of these features, appears to be necessary for these neurons to respond. In experiments to investigate whether the responses of these neurons would be useful for recognition of an individual, it has been shown that in many cases (77% of one sample), these neurons are sensitive to differences between faces. In experiments designed to investigate the information required for these neurons to respond, it has been shown that these neurons can respond to blurred images of faces, and to faces with only the high spatial frequencies included. A population of neurons with face-selective responses has also been found in the amygdala, which receives inputs from the temporal lobe visual cortex. In many cases these neurons respond differently to different faces. It is suggested that the importance of this type of neuron may be in the different emotional and social responses which occur to different faces, and which are disrupted by damage to the amygdala."

Whereas frequency is represented by place in the bat cochlea, no anatomical location represents of primary range. Target range is coded by the time interval between grouped discharges of primary auditory neurons in response to both the emitted sound and its echo. In the frequency-modulated-signal processing area of the auditory cortex of the mustache bat (Pteronotus parnellii rubiginosus), neurons respond poorly or not at all to synthesized orientation sounds or echoes alone but respond vigorously to echoes following the emitted sound with a specific delay from targets at a specific range. These range-tuned neurons are systemically arranged along the rostrocaudal axis of the frequency-modulated-signal processing area according to the delays to which they best respond, and thus represent target range in terms of cortical organization. The frequency-modulated-signal processing area therefore shows odotopic representation."

The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents (\u201csemantic structure\u201d) in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising."

Both LVQ and HMMs are stochastic algorithms holding considerable promise for speech recognition. In particular, LVQ is a vector quantizer with very powerful classification ability. HMMs, on the other hand, have the advantage that phone models can easily be concatenated to produce long utterance models, such as word or sentence models. The algorithm described combines the advantages inherent in each of these two algorithms. As the result of phoneme recognition experiments using a large vocabulary database of 5240 common Japanese words uttered in isolation by a male speaker, it is confirmed that the high discriminant ability of LVQ could be integrated into an HMM architecture easily extendible to longer utterance models.<<ETX>>"

Histological studies (1-4) have not supplied the detailed anatomy of these connections and oscillographic investigations have elucidated only gross aspects (5-12) of the system. A physiological method was reported (IO, II) for distinguishing afferent connections from or in the presence of electric fields, in determining the boundary of the auditory cortex. The method is used below to analyze the arrangement of the afferent fibers of the dorsal or middle ectosylvian area and to study in part the relation between the physical characteristics of the sound stimuli and activity in small groups of these aff erent connections. The chief physical qualities of sound that bear on hearing are intensity, frequency, duration and harmonic content, which are the four factors constituting the loudness function (13-16). In experiments on anesthetized animals, since only the onset of a sound elicits a cortical response, it is possible to omit duration from consideration, and if pure tones are used harmonic content can be disregarded. Thus, the afferent fiber activity can be studied in terms of intensity and frequency alone. Data are presented below for the following: I) the relation of frequency and intensity to the"

                "text": "In 1948 W. R. Bennett used a companding model for nonuniform quantization and proposed the formula D \\: = \\: \\frac{1}{12N^{2}} \\: \\int \\: p(x) [ E(x) ]^{-2} \\dx for the mean-square quantizing error where N is the number of levels, p (x) is the probability density of the input, and E \\prime (x) is the slope of the compressor curve. The formula, an approximation based on the assumption that the number of levels is large and overload distortion is negligible, is a useful tool for analytical studies of quantization. This paper gives a heuristic argument generalizing Bennett's formula to block quantization where a vector of random variables is quantized. The approach is again based on the asymptotic situation where N , the number of quantized output vectors, is very large. Using the resulting heuristic formula, an optimization is performed leading to an expression for the minimum quantizing noise attainable for any block quantizer of a given block size k . The results are consistent with Zador's results and specialize to known results for the one- and two-dimensional cases and for the case of infinite block length (k \\rightarrow \\infty) . The same heuristic approach also gives an alternate derivation of a bound of Elias for multidimensional quantization. Our approach leads to a rigorous method for obtaining upper bounds on the minimum distortion for block quantizers. In particular, for k = 3 we give a tight upper bound that may in fact be exact. The idea of representing a block quantizer by a block \"compressor\" mapping followed with an optimal quantizer for uniformly distributed random vectors is also explored. It is not always possible to represent an optimal quantizer with this block companding model."

The specific form of aphasia observed in a patient is determined by the locus of cerebral insult. However, given the complexity of the language processing system, involving as it does complex linguistic mechanisms\u2014phonological, lexical, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic\u2014as well as associated cognitive systems (e.g., working memory), a vast number of different forms of aphasia may be observed. Each form of aphasia observed is presumed to result from the particular type of damage to a component or combination of components of the language processing system. It is unrealistic, therefore, in the limited space available here, to attempt a review of the full range of possible language deficits in aphasia. A more manageable task is to focus the review on just one subsystem of the language faculty. This review will focus on the lexical system."

The goal of such a system is data compression: to reduce the bit rate so as to minimize communication channel capacity or digital storage memory requirements while maintaining the necessary fidelity of the data. The mapping for each vector may or may not have memory in the sense of depending on past actions of the coder, just as in well established scalar techniques such as PCM, which has no memory, and predictive quantization, which does. Even though information theory implies that one can always obtain better performance by coding vectors instead of scalars, scalar quantizers have remained by far the most common data compression system because of their simplicity and good performance when the communication rate is sufficiently large. In addition, relatively few design techniques have existed for vector quantizers. During the past few years several design algorithms have been developed for a variety of vector quantizers and the performance of these codes has been studied for speech waveforms, speech linear predictive parameter vectors, images, and several simulated random processes. It is the purpose of this article to survey some of these design techniques and their applications."

Clinical observations had suggested the selective impairment and selective preservation of certain categories of visual stimuli. In all 4 patients a significant discrepancy between their ability to identify inanimate objects and inability to identify living things and foods was demonstrated. In 2 patients it was possible to compare visual and verbal modalities and the same pattern of dissociation was observed in both. For 1 patient, comprehension of abstract words was significantly superior to comprehension of concrete words. Consistency of responses was recorded within a modality in contrast to a much lesser degree of consistency between modalities. We interpret our findings in terms of category specificity in the organization of meaning systems that are also modality specific semantic systems."

The distortion is defined as the expected value of some function of the error between the input and the output of the quantizer. Equations are derived for the parameters of a quantizer with minimum distortion. The equations are not soluble without recourse to numerical methods, so an algorithm is developed to simplify their numerical solution. The case of an input signal with normally distributed amplitude and an expected squared error distortion measure is explicitly computed and values of the optimum quantizer parameters are tabulated. The optimization of a quantizer subject to the restriction that both input and output levels be equally spaced is also treated, and appropriate parameters are tabulated for the same case as above."

By target directed they mean that the arm can position its end-effector at the point of gaze specified by a pair of stereo targetting cameras. Hence, the system is able to 'touch the point targetted by its eyes. The new design extends the targetting system to an articulated camera platform-the equivalent of the human eye-head-neck system. This permits the robot to solve the inverse problem: given the current configuration of the arm, the system is able to reorient the camera platform to focus on the end-effector. Because of obstacles, the camera platform will generally have to peer around obstacles that block its view. Hence the new system is able to move the eye-head-neck system to see the hand.<<ETX>>"

We emphasize Lanczos and subspace iteration-based methods for determining several of the largest singular triplets (singular values and corresponding left- and right-singular vectors) for sparse matrices arising from two practical applications: information retrieval and seismic reflection tomography. The target architectures for our implementations are the CRAY-2S/4\u2013128 and Alliant FX/80. The sparse SVD problem is well motivated by recent information-retrieval techniques in which dominant singular values and their corresponding singular vectors of large sparse term-document matrices are desired, and by nonlinear inverse problems from seismic tomography applications which require approximate pseudo-inverses of large sparse Jacobian matrices. This research may help advance the development of future out-of-core sparse SVD methods, which can be used, for example, to handle extremely large sparse matrices 0 \u00d7 (106) rows or columns associated with extremely large databases in query-based information-retrieval applications."

Using matching to sample techniques it was possible to demonstrate selective impairments and selective preservations not only of broad categories of semantic knowledge but also of particular subsets of such categories. Specifically, Y.O.T.'s comprehension of 'objects' was, in general, significantly more impaired than for foods or living things. Within the broad class of objects she was significantly more impaired in the comprehension of small manipulable objects than large man-made objects. Within her proper noun vocabulary there was a significant dissociation between her good comprehension of proper nouns having a unique and well-known referent (e.g., Churchill) and common proper nouns without such a referent (e.g., Jones). Her error responses were not consistent, semantic similarity and significant rate effects were observed, and it was therefore considered that her category specific comprehension deficits were primarily ones of access to a full semantic representation. We attempt to give a principled account of the increasing number of seemingly arbitrary instances of fine-grain categorical impairments of semantic knowledge. We have suggested that different weighting values from multiple sensory channels will be important in the acquisition of different categories of knowledge and that such differential weightings could be the basis of the categorical organization of systems in the brain subserving semantic knowledge."

The \u201cambiguity\u201d of the stimulus (the frequency with which different members of a group are visually similar) is an adjuvant factor. But prosopagnosia is not specific to human faces.

Clinically V.E.R.'s capacity for propositional speech and her comprehension of the simplest verbal instructions appeared to be absent. Nevertheless using matching-to-sample techniques it was possible to demonstrate the selective preservation (foods, animals and flowers) and the selective impairment (objects) of specific semantic categories. Furthermore there was evidence from analyses of response consistency and presentation rate effects that her deficit was primarily one of access to the full semantic representation of words. We suggest that this access impairment arose because the system had become refractory, such refractoriness being category specific."

A series of relevance weighting functions is derived and is justified by theoretical considerations. In particular, it is shown that specific weighted search methods are implied by a general probabilistic theory of retrieval. Different applications of relevance weighting are illustrated by experimental results for test collections."

Psychomotor development up to this age had been normal. Today she shows little impairment in higher nervous function depending on the ablated hemisphere. Left-sided motor performance has improved and sensory deficit is scant. There is no hemianopia and the right eye visual field is enlarged. Dichotic listening shows left ear preference and no lesion effect. These findings suggest that significant and positive adaptation may occur in mature brain."
