The posterior probability is usually derived from a prior model and a likelihood model. The latter relates to how data is observed and is problem domain dependent. The former depends on how various prior constraints are expressed. Markov Random Field Models (MRF) theory is a tool to encode contextual constraints into the prior probability. This paper presents a unified approach for MRF modeling in low and high level computer vision. The unification is made possible due to a recent advance in MRF modeling for high level object recognition. Such unification provides a systematic approach for vision modeling based on sound mathematical principles."

They can be applied for example in the output of the visual processes to reconstruct surfaces from sparse and noisy depth data, or to integrate early vision processes to label physical discontinuities. Drawbacks of MRFs models have been the computational complexity of the implementation and the difficulty in estimating the parameters of the model. This paper derives deterministic approximations to MRFs models. One of the considered models is shown to give in a natural way the graduate non convexity (GNC) algorithm. This model can be applied to smooth a field preserving its discontinuities. A new model is then proposed: it allows the gradient of the field to be enhanced at the discontinuities and smoothed elsewhere. All the theoretical results are obtained in the framework of the mean field theory, that is a well known statistical mechanics technique. A fast, parallel, and iterative algorithm to solve the deterministic equations of the two models is presented, together with experiments on synthetic and real images. The algorithm is applied to the problem of surface reconstruction is in the case of sparse data. A fast algorithm ismore\u00a0\u00bb also described that solves the problem of aligning the discontinuities of different visual models with intensity edges via integration.\u00ab\u00a0less"

All use Markov random field (MRF) models to include prior contextual information. The comparison is based on artificial binary images which are degraded by Gaussian noise. Robustness is tested with correlated noise and with object and background textured. The ICM algorithm is evaluated when the degradation and model parameters must be estimated, in both supervised and unsupervised modes and on two real images. The results are assessed by visual inspection and through a numerical criterion. It is concluded that contextual information from MRF models improves segmentation when the number of categories and the degradation model are known and that parameters can be effectively estimated. None of the three algorithms is consistently best, but the ICM algorithm is the most robust. The energy of the a posteriori distribution is not always minimized at the best segmentation.<<ETX>>"

It is rendered especially difficult by the presence of motion boundaries and occlusion regions which are not taken into account by standard regularization approaches. In this paper, the authors present a multimodal approach to the problem of motion estimation in which the computation of visual motion is based on several complementary constraints. It is shown that multiple constraints can provide more accurate flow estimation in a wide range of circumstances. The theoretical framework relies on Bayesian estimation associated with global statistical models, namely, Markov random fields. The constraints introduced here aim to address the following issues: optical flow estimation while preserving motion boundaries, processing of occlusion regions, fusion between gradient and feature-based motion constraint equations. Deterministic relaxation algorithms are used to merge information and to provide a solution to the maximum a posteriori estimation of the unknown dense motion field. The algorithm is well suited to a multiresolution implementation which brings an appreciable speed-up as well as a significant improvement of estimation when large displacements are present in the scene. Experiments on synthetic and real world image sequences are reported. >"

This paper presents a systematic study of these models and defines a general discontinuity adaptive (DA) MRF model. By analyzing the Euler equation associated with the energy minimization, it shows that the fundamental difference between different models lies in the behavior of interaction between neighboring points, which is determined by the a priori smoothness constraint encoded into the energy function. An important necessary condition is derived for the interaction to be adaptive to discontinuities to avoid oversmoothing. This forms the basis on which a class of adaptive interaction functions (AIFs) is defined. The DA model is defined in terms of the Euler equation constrained by this class of AIFs. Its solution is C/sup 1/ continuous and allows arbitrarily large but bounded slopes in dealing with discontinuities. Because of the continuous nature, it is stable to changes in parameters and data, a good property for regularizing ill-posed problems. Experimental results are shown. >"

A spatiotemporal edge in an image sequence is modeled as a surface patch in a 3-D spatiotemporal space. A likelihood ratio test enables its detection as well as simultaneous estimation of its related attributes. It is shown that the computation of this test leads to convolving the image sequence with a set of predetermined masks. The emphasis is on a restricted but widely relevant and useful case of surface patch, namely the planar one. In addition, an implementation of the procedure whose computation cost is merely equivalent to a spatial gradient operator is presented. This method can be of interest for motion-analysis schemes, not only for supplying spatiotemporal segmentation, but also for extracting local motion information. Moreover, it can cope with occlusion contours and important displacement magnitude. Experiments have been carried out with both synthetic and real images. >"

In addition, an algorithm is developed for determining the number of statistically distinct regions in an image and estimating the parameters of those regions. Both algorithms use a causal Gaussian autoregressive model to describe the mean, variance, and spatial correlation of the image textures. Together, the algorithms can be used to perform unsupervised texture segmentation. The multiple resolution segmentation algorithm first segments images at coarse resolution and then progresses to finer resolutions until individual pixels are classified. This method results in accurate segmentations and requires significantly less computation than some previously known methods. The field containing the classification of each pixel in the image is modeled as a Markov random field. Segmentation at each resolution is then performed by maximizing the a posteriori probability of this field subject to the resolution constraint. At each resolution, the a posteriori probability is maximized by a deterministic greedy algorithm which iteratively chooses the classification of individual pixels or pixel blocks. The unsupervised parameter estimation algorithm determines both the number of textures and their parameters by minimizing a global criterion based on the AIC information criterion. Clusters corresponding to the individual textures are formed by alternately estimating the cluster parameters and repartitioning the data into those clusters. Concurrently, the number of distinct textures is estimated by combining clusters until a minimum of the criterion is reached. >"

A Gauss-Markov random field (GMRF) is used for the conditional density of the intensity array, given the unobserved texture class and a second-order Ising distribution for the prior distribution over the texture classes. The GMRF model for the conditional density allows a closed-form expression for the density to be written, so that the dependence of the density on the label parameters can be expressed. This expression is used here to derive the joint distribution of intensity and label arrays. The joint distribution is maximized using the stochastic relaxation method and the deterministic iterated conditional mode (ICM) technique. The ICM algorithm can be implemented efficiently on a neural net with local connectivity and regular structure. Comparisons of these two methods are given using real textured images.<<ETX>>"

Although this approach performs well, it has a number of disadvantages. In particular, exact MAP estimates cannot be computed, approximate MAP estimates are computationally expensive to compute, and unsupervised parameter estimation of the MRF is difficult. The authors propose a new approach to Bayesian image segmentation that directly addresses these problems. The new method replaces the MRF model with a novel multiscale random field (MSRF) and replaces the MAP estimator with a sequential MAP (SMAP) estimator derived from a novel estimation criteria. Together, the proposed estimator and model result in a segmentation algorithm that is not iterative and can be computed in time proportional to MN where M is the number of classes and N is the number of pixels. The also develop a computationally efficient method for unsupervised estimation of model parameters. Simulations on synthetic images indicate that the new algorithm performs better and requires much less computation than MAP estimation using simulated annealing. The algorithm is also found to improve classification accuracy when applied to the segmentation of multispectral remotely sensed images with ground truth data."

The MRF is a coupled one which provides continuity (inside regions of smooth gray tones) and discontinuity (at region boundaries) constraints for the restoration problem which is, in general, ill posed. The computational difficulty associated with the EM procedure for MRFs is resolved by using the mean field theory from statistical mechanics. An orthonormal blur decomposition is used to reduce the chances of undesirable locally optimal estimates. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world images show that this approach provides good blur estimates and restored images. The restored images are comparable to those obtained by a Wiener filter in mean-square error, but are most visually pleasing."

The posterior distribution of the motion field given image observations is then a Gibbs distribution.

The Bayes smoothing algorithm yields the a posteriori distribution of the scene value at each pixel, given the total noisy image, in a recursive way. The a posteriori distribution together with a criterion of optimality then determine a Bayes estimate of the scene. The algorithm presented is an extension of a 1-D Bayes smoothing algorithm to 2-D and it gives the optimum Bayes estimate for the scene value at each pixel. Computational concerns in 2-D, however, necessitate certain simplifying assumptions on the model and approximations on the implementation of the algorithm. In particular, the scene (noiseless image) is modeled as a Markov mesh random field, a special class of Markov random fields, and the Bayes smoothing algorithm is applied on overlapping strips (horizontal/vertical) of the image consisting of several rows (columns). It is assumed that the signal (scene values) vector sequence along the strip is a vector Markov chain. Since signal correlation in one of the dimensions is not fully used along the edges of the strip, estimates are generated only along the middle sections of the strips. The overlapping strips are chosen such that the union of the middle sections of the strips gives the whole image. The Bayes smoothing algorithm presented here is valid for scene random fields consisting of multilevel (discrete) or continuous random variables."

The authors' formulation takes into account the possibility of multiple motions at a particular location.

The textured images under study are modeled by a proposed hierarchical Markov random field (MRF) model. This model is formed by combining the binomial model for textures and the multilevel logistic model for region distributions. The supervised segmentation is achieved by a novel algorithm which can reach the global maxima of the posteriori distribution even if the textures are modeled by an MRF model. For unsupervised segmentation, a novel parameter estimation scheme is proposed for estimating the model parameters directly from a given image. The proposed technique is verified by a variety of textured images, such as synthesized textures, natural textures, and aerial images, in both the supervised and unsupervised segmentation cases.<<ETX>>"

The only explicit assumption made is that the intensity data can be modeled by a Gauss Markov random field (GMRF). The image is divided into a number of nonoverlapping regions and the GMRF parameters are computed from each of these regions. A simple clustering method is used to merge these regions. The parameters of the model estimated from the clustered segments are then used in two different schemes, one being all approximation to the maximum a posterior estimate of the labels and the other minimizing the percentage misclassification error. The proposed approach is contrasted with the algorithm of S. Lakshamanan and H. Derin (1989), which uses a simultaneous parameter estimation and segmentation scheme. The results of the adaptive segmentation algorithm of Lakshamanan and Derin are compared with a simple nearest-neighbor classification scheme to show that if enough information is available, simple techniques could be used as alternatives to computationally expensive schemes. >"

The model, referred to as a generalized Gaussian Markov random field (GGMRF), is named for its similarity to the generalized Gaussian distribution used in robust detection and estimation. The model satisfies several desirable analytical and computational properties for map estimation, including continuous dependence of the estimate on the data, invariance of the character of solutions to scaling of data, and a solution which lies at the unique global minimum of the a posteriori log-likelihood function. The GGMRF is demonstrated to be useful for image reconstruction in low-dosage transmission tomography."

RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing"

                "text": "This thesis investigates approaches to object recognition in computer vision. The starting point of the investigation is depth, or range, images of visible object surfaces. At the representation level, we use attributed relational graphs (ARGs), for object-centered descriptions of surfaces in images as well as models. An ARG encodes invariant properties such as curvature of surfaces, and relations such as distances and normal angles between them. At the computational level, the main problems studied concern firstly the extraction of ARG representation from range images, which involves the issues of continuity-controlled smoothing and reliable computation of surface curvature, and secondly inexact matching between the image ARG and object model ARGs. First we propose a unified computational framework for solving low, intermediate and high level computer vision problems in 3D object recognition from range images. All three levels of computation are cast in an optimisation framework and are suited for implementation on parallel distributed, or neuron-like, architectures. In the low level computation, the tasks are to estimate the curvature images from the input range data, in which depth discontinuities are taken into account to avoid oversmoothing. Subsequent processing at the intermediate level is concerned with segmenting these curvature images into coherent curvature sign maps. At the high level, image features are matched against model features based on the object-centered ARG representation. It is shown that the above computational tasks at each of the three different levels can all be formulated as optimising an energy function. The optimisation is performed using parallel and distributed relaxation-based algorithms which are well suited for neural network implementation. We then further develop the low level work by proposing a class of adaptive regularizer (AR) for continuity-controlled smoothing. We analyze mechanisms by which the AR works. The analysis shows that the fundamental difference between different regularizes lies in properties of interaction between neighboring points, which relates to the smoothing strength, determined by these regularizes. Based on this, we derive conditions under which regularizes are adaptive to discontinuities to avoid oversmoothing. The analysis also shows that adaptive regularization solutions have a closer affinity to solving Euler equations than to minimising some close-formed energy functionals. We further develop the high level work by proposing a parallel distributed approach for matching and recognizing overlapping partially occluded objects. Simultaneous separation and inexact matching of superimposed sub-ARGs is performed by optimising a global gain functional using relaxation labelling methods. We suggest that the approach could potentially perform simultaneous recognition of overlapping free-formed 3D objects directly from range data without segmentation: Segmentation, matching and recognition are all done once the direct mapping from pixels to models is found. The algorithm is inherently parallel and distributive and could be efficiently implemented on commercially available SIMD architectures such as the Connectionist Machine."

A texture model is a mathematical procedure capable of producing and describing a textured image. We explore the use of Markov random fields as texture models. The binomial model, where each point in the texture has a binomial distribution with parameter controlled by its neighbors and ``number of tries'' equal to the number of gray levels, was taken to be the basic model for the analysis. A method of generating samples from the binomial model is given, followed by a theoretical and practical analysis of the method's convergence. Examples show how the parameters of the Markov random field control the strength and direction of the clustering in the image. The power of the binomial model to produce blurry, sharp, line-like, and blob-like textures is demonstrated. Natural texture samples were digitized and their parameters were estimated under the Markov random field model. A hypothesis test was used for an objective assessment of goodness-of-fit under the Markov random field model. Overall, microtextures fit the model well. The estimated parameters of the natural textures were used as input to the generation procedure.

It is well known that multigrid methods can improve significantly the convergence rate and the quality of the final results of iterative relaxation techniques. A hierarchical model is proposed, which consists of a label pyramid and a whole observation field. The parameters of the coarse grid can be derived by simple computation from the finest grid. In the label pyramid, a new local interaction is introduced between two neighbor grids. This model gives a relaxation algorithm which can be run in parallel on the entire pyramid. The model allows propagation of local interactions more efficiently, giving estimates closer to the global optimum for deterministic as well as for stochastic relaxation schemes. It can also be seen as a way to incorporate cliques with far apart sites for a reasonable price.<<ETX>>"

The degradation is assumed to be due to a space invariant, periodic, nonseparable known point-spread function, and additive white noise. Our basic approach is to represent the images by a class of spatial interaction models, namely the simultaneous autoregressve models and the conditional Markov models defined on toroidal lattices, and develop minimum mean-squared error restoration algorithms using these models. The restoration algorithms are optimal, if the parameters characterizing the interaction models are exactly known. However, in practice, the parameters are estimated from the images. By using spatial interaction models, we develop restoration algorithms that do not require the availability of the original image or its prototype. The specific structure of the underlying lattice enables the implementation of the filters using fast Fourier transform (FFT) computations, Several restoration examples are given."

The partial modeling takes place by taking the Bayesian statistical decision rule and a number of important heuristics into consideration while maximizing the log likelihood function. Applications include the automatic selection of multiple thresholds, single rigid motion estimation or multiple rigid motion segmentation, and estimation from two perspective views. It is believed that the proposed MF estimator will aid in solving many robust estimation problems that demand an estimator that is either highly robust or capable of handling contaminated Gaussian mixture models. >"

The formulation involves the specification of a deterministic structural model along with stochastic observation and motion field models. Two motion models are proposed: a globally smooth model based on vector Markov random fields and a piecewise smooth model derived from coupled vector-binary Markov random fields. Two estimation criteria are studied. In the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation, the a posteriori probability of motion given data is maximized, whereas in the minimum expected cost (MEC) estimation, the expectation of a certain cost function is minimized. Both algorithms generate sample fields by means of stochastic relaxation implemented via the Gibbs sampler. Two versions are developed: one for a discrete state space and the other for a continuous state space.

In this note, we investigate a new comprehensive approach to minimize global energy functions using a multiscale relaxation algorithm. The energy function is minimized over nested subspaces of the original space of possible solutions. These subspaces consist of solutions which are constrained at different scales. The constrained relaxation is implemented via a coarse-to-fine multiresolution algorithm that yields fast convergence towards high quality estimates when compared to standard monoresolution or multigrid relaxation schemes. It also appears to be far less sensitive to local minima than standard relaxation algorithms. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated on a highly nonlinear combinatorial problem which consists of estimating long-range motion in an image sequence on a discrete label space. The method is compared to standard relaxation algorithms on real world and synthetic image sequences."

The aim is to develop methods for image understanding based on structured restoration, for example automatic detection of abnormalities. The limits of applicability of the algorithms are also traced by making the optical degradations more and more severe until the algorithms no longer succeed in their task. This book is suitable for an advanced undergraduate or graduate seminar in pattern theory, or as an accompanying book for applied probability, computer vision or pattern recognition."

The shapes of these clusters are compared with shapes corresponding to a known unimodal distribution by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The best fitting cluster is then removed from the space, and a new iteration starts. Constrained random sampling keeps the computation low.

The authors consider both the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimate and the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimate for image estimation and image restoration. Compound image models consist of several submodels having different characteristics along with an underlying structure model which govern transitions between these image submodels. Two different compound random field models are employed, the doubly stochastic Gaussian (DSG) random field and a compound Gauss-Markov (CGM) random field. The authors present MAP estimators for DSG and CGM random fields using simulated annealing. A fast-converging algorithm called deterministic relaxation, which, however, converges to only a locally optimal MAP estimate, is also presented as an alternative for reducing computational loading on sequential machines. For comparison purposes, the authors include results on the fixed-lag smoothing MMSE estimator for the DSG field and its suboptimal M-algorithm approximation. >"

The recognition task includes both locating the overall pattern and identifying each of its features. Location is achieved by finding a geometric registration function that does a good job of superimposing the instance and the model. Identifying the features requires matching each model feature with the corresponding instance feature.A pruned tree-search algorithm is developed which makes effective use of the Soviet ellipsoid algorithm for feasibility of linear constraints. An interesting blend of theoretical analysis and practical implementation shows that the resulting algorithm has an expected runtime that is theoretically asymptotically quadratic in the number of feature points, but practically linear in n for patterns with fewer than 100 points.Contents: Introduction; Task Abstraction; Prior Approaches; A Linear Programming Approach; Geometry of Registrations and Ellipsoids; Worst-Case Number of Feasible Matchings; Random Patterns; Expected Cost of Feasibility Testing; Expected Size of Search Tree; Monte Carlo Trials; Conclusions.Henry S.

Examples are shape from shading, edge detection, motion analysis, structure from motion, and surface interpolation. As shown by Poggio and Koch [Poggio, T. & Koch, C. (1985) Proc. R. Soc. London, Ser. B 226, 303-323], quadratic variational problems, an important subset of early vision tasks, can be \"solved\" by linear, analog electrical, or chemical networks. However, in the presence of discontinuities, the cost function is nonquadratic, raising the question of designing efficient algorithms for computing the optimal solution. Recently, Hopfield and Tank [Hopfield, J. J. & Tank, D. W. (1985) Biol. Cybern. 52, 141-152] have shown that networks of nonlinear analog \"neurons\" can be effective in computing the solution of optimization problems. We show how these networks can be generalized to solve the nonconvex energy functionals of early vision. We illustrate this approach by implementing a specific analog network, solving the problem of reconstructing a smooth surface from sparse data while preserving its discontinuities. These results suggest a novel computational strategy for solving early vision problems in both biological and real-time artificial vision systems."

It uses multiple attributes associated with each image point to yield a generally overdetermined system of constraints, taking into account possible structural discontinuities and occlusions. In the algorithm implemented, intensity, edgeness, and cornerness attributes are used in conjunction with the constraints arising from intraregional smoothness, field continuity and discontinuity, and occlusions to compute dense displacement fields and occlusion maps along the pixel grids. The intensity, edgeness, and cornerness are invariant under rigid motion in the image plane. In order to cope with large disparities, a multiresolution multigrid structure is employed. Coarser level edgeness and cornerness measures are obtained by blurring the finer level measures. The algorithm has been tested on real-world scenes with depth discontinuities and occlusions. A special case of two-view matching is stereo matching, where the motion between two images is known. The algorithm can be easily specialized to perform stereo matching using the epipolar constraint. >"

With the Cresceptron, humans as designers need only to provide a good structure for learning, but they are relieved of most design details. The Cresceptron has been tested on the task of visual recognition by recognizing 3-D general objects from 2-D photographic images of natural scenes and segmenting the recognized objects from the cluttered image background. The Cresceptron uses a hierarchical structure to grow networks automatically, adaptively, and incrementally through learning. The Cresceptron makes it possible to generalize training exemplars to other perceptually equivalent items. Experiments with a variety of real-world images are reported to demonstrate the feasibility of learning in the Cresceptron.<<ETX>>"

One of the fundamental weaknesses of current computer vision systems to be used in practical applications is their inability to adapt the segmentation process as real-world changes occur in the image. We present the first closed loop image segmentation system which incorporates a genetic algorithm to adapt the segmentation process to changes in image characteristics caused by variable environmental conditions such as time of day, time of year, clouds, etc. The segmentation problem is formulated as an optimization problem and the genetic algorithm efficiently searches the hyperspace of segmentation parameter combinations to determine the parameter set which maximizes the segmentation quality criteria. The goals of our adaptive image segmentation system are to provide continuous adaptation to normal environmental variations, to exhibit learning capabilities, and to provide robust performance when interacting with a dynamic environment. We present experimental results which demonstrate learning and the ability to adapt the segmentation performance in outdoor color imagery."

Compared with conventional object-matching schemes, the proposed technique provides a more general and compact formulation of the problem and a solution more suitable for parallel implementation. At the coarse search stage, the surface matching scores between the input image and each object model in the database are computed through a Hopfield network and are used to select the candidates for further consideration. At the fine search stage, the object models selected from the previous stage are fed into another Hopfield network for vertex matching. The object model that has the best surface and vertex correspondences with the input image is finally singled out as the best matched model. Experimental results are reported using both synthetic and real range images to corroborate the proposed theory."

An automatic segmentation and description system is used to produce the image representations so that the matching procedures must cope with variations in feature values, missing objects, and possible multiple matches. This environment is used to test different relaxation matching schemes under a variety of conditions. The best performance (of those we compared), in terms of the number of iterations and the number of errors, is for the gradient-based optimization approach of Faugeras and Price. The related optimization approach of Hummel and Zucker performed almost as well, with differences primarily in difficult matches (i.e., where much of the evidence is against the match, for instance, poor segmentations). The product combination rule proposed by Peleg was extremely fast, indeed, too fast to work when global context is needed. The classical Rosenfeld, Hummel, and Zucker method is included for historical comparisons and performed only adequately, producing fewer correct matches and taking more iterations."

The authors show how to learn such a model from a series of training images depicting a class of objects, producing a model that represents a probability distribution over the variation in object appearance. Features identified in an image through perceptual organization are represented by a graph whose nodes include feature labels and numeric measurements. A learning procedure generalizes multiple image graphs to form a model graph in which the numeric measurements are characterized by probability distributions. A matching procedure, using a similarity metric based on a non-parametric probability density estimator, compares model and image graphs to identify an instance of a modeled object in an image. Experimental results are presented from a system constructed to test this approach. The system learns to recognize partially occluded 2-D objects in 2-D images using shape cues. It can recognize objects as similar in general appearance while distinguishing them by their detailed features.<<ETX>>"

This book examines the measurement of this movement and the use of relative movement to locate the boundaries of physical objects in the environment. It investigates the nature of the computations that are necessary to perform this analysis by any vision system, biological or artificial. \nThe author first defines the goals of these visual tasks, reveals the properties of the physical world that a vision system can rely upon to achieve such goals, and suggests general methods that can be used to carry out the tasks. From the general methods, she designs algorithms specifying a particular sequence of computations that a vision system can execute to perform these visual tasks. These algorithms are implemented on a computer system under a variety of circumstances. Combined with the traditional approaches of psychology and neurophysiology, this computational approach provides an exciting analysis of visual function, raising many new questions about the human vision system for further investigation. \nEllen Catherine Hildreth received her doctorate from MIT.

They argue that representations of structural relationships in the arrangements of primitive image features, as detected by the perceptual organization process, are essential for analyzing complex imagery. They term these representations collated features. The choice of collated features is determined by the generic shape of the desired objects in the scene. The detection process for collated features is more robust than the local operations for region segmentation and contour tracing. The important structural information encoded in collated features aids various visual tasks such as object segmentation, correspondence processes, and shape description. The proposed method initially detects all reasonable feature groupings. A constraint satisfaction network is then used to model the complex interactions between the collations and select the promising ones. Stereo matching is performed on the collations to obtain height information. This aids in further reasoning on the collated features and results in the 3-D description of the desired objects. >"

The algorithm, which aims at obtaining the maximum a posteriori (MAP) segmentation is a simulated annealing algorithm that is interrupted at regular intervals for estimating the GRF parameters. Maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates of the parameters based on the current segmentation are used to obtain the next segmentation. It is proven that the parameter estimates and the segmentations converge in distribution to the ML estimate of the parameters and the MAP segmentation with those parameter estimates, respectively. Due to computational difficulties, however, only an approximate version of the algorithm is implemented. The approximate algorithm is applied on several two- and four-region images with different noise levels and with first-order and second-order neighborhoods. >"

At the core of this approach is the Robust Sequential Estimator, a robust extension to the method of sequential least squares. Unlike most existing surface characterization techniques, the authors' method generates complete surface hypotheses in parameter space. Given a noisy depth map of an unknown 3-D scene, the algorithm first selects appropriate seed points representing possible surfaces. For each nonredundant seed it chooses the best approximating model from a given set of competing models using a modified Akaike Information Criterion. With this best model, each surface is expanded from its seed over the entire image, and this step is repeated for all seeds. Those points which appear to be outliers with respect to the model in growth are not included in the (possibly disconnected) surface. Point regions are deleted from each newly grown surface in the prune stage. Noise, outliers, or coincidental surface alignment may cause some points to appear to belong to more than one surface. These ambiguities are resolved by a weighted voting scheme within a 5/spl times/5 decision window centered around the ambiguous point. The isolated point regions left after the resolve stage are removed and any missing points in the data are filled by the surface having a majority consensus in an 8-neighborhood. >"

Given correspondences between these 3D lines and 2D lines found in the image, the goal is to find rotation (R) and transition (T) which map a world coordinate system to the camera coordinate system. Three algorithms are developed: R-then-T, R-and-T, and Med-R-and-T. Algorithms R-then-T and R-and-T are least square algorithms. Algorithm R-then-T solves for rotation first and uses the result to solve for translation. The second algorithm R-and-T solves for both rotation and translation simultaneously. The results from the second algorithm are much better. Some of the correspondences may be wrong. Algorithm Med-R-and-T can handle up to 49.9% outliers or gross errors in the date. It minimizes the median of the square of the same error measure used by the R-and-T algorithm. A closed-form expression function is developed for the uncertainty in the output parameters as a function of the variance of the noise in the input parameters.<<ETX>>"

The network handles uncertainty by making the recognition and segmentation decisions simultaneously, in a cooperative way. Both problems are posed as labeling problems, and a coupled Markov random field (MRF) is used to provide a single formal framework for both. Prior domain knowledge is represented as weights within the MRF network and interacts with the evidence to yield a labeling decision. The domain problem is the recognition of structured objects composed of simple junction and link primitives. Implementation experiments demonstrate the parallel segmentation and recognition of multiple objects in noisy ambiguous scenes with occlusion.<<ETX>>"

The goal of this work is to demonstrate the generality and practical value of a probabilistic (in particular, Bayesian) approach to this problem, particularly in the context of Computer Vision. In this approach, the prior knowledge about the solution is expressed in the form of a Gibbsian probability distribution on the space of all possible functions, so that the reconstruction task in formulated as an estimation problem.

The input is a list of line segments of an image obtained from a preprocessing stage, which is usually fragmentary and contains extraneous noisy segments. The output is the correspondences between the image line segments and model line segments. We use attributed relational graphs (ARG) to describe images and models. An ARG consists of a set of nodes, each node representing a line segment, and attributed relations between nodes. The task of matching is to find the best correspondences between the image ARG and the model ARG. The correspondences are \nfound using a relaxation labeling algorithm, which optimizes a criterion of similarity. The algorithm is capable of subgraph matching of an image road structure to a map road model covering an area 10 times larger than the area imaged by the sensor, provided that the image distortion due to perspective imaging geometry has been corrected during preprocessing stages. We present matching experiments and demonstrate the stability of the matching method to extraneous line segments, missing line segments, and errors in scaling."

A Markov random field (MRF) is employed to represent the prior contextual information. The consistent labelling is defined as the maximum a posteriori (MAP) labelling. It is achieved using iterative updating according to a rule derived using mean field theory (MFT). The benefits of the approach include the embedding of observations into the matching criterion function and the ability of the algorithm to find the global rather than nearest local optimum. The approach is applied to stereo vision and the experimental results demonstrate its viability."

Smith in the Chair] SUMMARY A continuous two-dimensional region is partitioned into a fine rectangular array of sites or \"pixels\", each pixel having a particular \"colour\" belonging to a prescribed finite set. The true colouring of the region is unknown but, associated with each pixel, there is a possibly multivariate record which conveys imperfect information about its colour according to a known statistical model. The aim is to reconstruct the true scene, with the additional knowledge that pixels close together tend to have the same or similar colours. In this paper, it is assumed that the local characteristics of the true scene can be represented by a nondegenerate Markov random field. Such information can be combined with the records by Bayes' theorem and the true scene can be estimated according to standard criteria. However, the computational burden is enormous and the reconstruction may reflect undesirable largescale properties of the random field. Thus, a simple, iterative method of reconstruction is proposed, which does not depend on these large-scale characteristics. The method is illustrated by computer simulations in which the original scene is not directly related to the assumed random field. Some complications, including parameter estimation, are discussed.

Various issues related to representation and modeling of 3-D objects are addressed. A new method for the approximation of 3-D objects by a set of planar faces is discussed. The major advantage of this method is that it is applicable to a complete object and not restricted to single range view which was the limitation of the previous work in 3-D scene analysis. The method is a sequential region growing algorithm. It is not applied to range images, but rather to a set of 3-D points. The 3-D model of an object is obtained by combining the object points from a sequence of range data images corresponding to various views of the object, applying the necessary transformations and then approximating the surface by polygons. A stochastic labeling technique is used to do the shape matching of 3-D objects. The technique matches the faces of an unknown view against the faces of the model. It explicitly maximizes a criterion function based on the ambiguity and inconsistency of classification. It is hierarchical and uses results obtained at low levels to speed up and improve the accuracy of results at higher levels. The objective here is to match the individual views of the object taken from any vantage point. Details of the algorithm are presented and the results are shown on several unknown views of a complicated automobile casting."

The approach adopted owes much to the work of Grenander and colleagues at Brown University on pattern analysis and involves designing stochastic deformable templates for objects in the underlying image scenes. A wide range of realistic object poses can be captured by imposing a prior probability distribution over the space of allowable deformations. We show how hierarchical models can be used to organize the prior information into a coherent structure. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are exploited to recover the deformation given observed image data."

Two point patterns (sets of points) (x/sub i/) and (x/sub i/); i=1, 2, . . ., n are given in m-dimensional space, and the similarity transformation parameters (rotation, translation, and scaling) that give the least mean squared error between these point patterns are needed. Recently, K.S. Arun et al. (1987) and B.K.P. Horn et al. (1987) presented a solution of this problem. Their solution, however, sometimes fails to give a correct rotation matrix and gives a reflection instead when the data is severely corrupted. The proposed theorem is a strict solution of the problem, and it always gives the correct transformation parameters even when the data is corrupted. >"

The application of this technique usually results in a least squares approximation or a spline fitting of the parameter of interest. This is often adequate for estimating smooth parameter fields. However, when the parameter of interest has discontinuities the estimate formed by this technique will smooth over the discontinuities. Several techniques have been introduced to modify the regularization process to incorporate discontinuities. Many of these approaches however, will themselves be ill-posed or ill-conditioned. This paper presents a technique for incorporating discontinuities into the reconstruction problem while maintaining a well-posed and well-conditioned problem statement. The resulting computational problem is a convex functional minimization problem. This method is compared to previous approaches and examples are presented for the problems of reconstructing curves and surfaces with discontinuities and for estimating image data. Computational issues arising in both analog and digital implementations are also discussed. >"

This paper presents a comparative study of the two kinds of models. We analyze the mechanisms of adaptation (to discontinuities) and robustness (to outliers) and give a necessary condition for the adaptation and the robustness. We then give a common deenition of both models. The deenition captures the essence of the adaptation ability and gives in theory innnitely many choices of functions suitable for the adaptation in MRF and robust models. The likeness between the two models suggests that results in the two areas are interchangeable to beneet each other."

A method for estimation of contour properties based on smoothing spline approximations is presented. Generalized cross-validation is to devise an automatic algorithm for finding the optimal value of the smoothing (regularization) parameter from the data. The cross-validated smoothing splines are then used to obtain optimal estimates of the derivatives of quantized contours. Experimental results are presented which demonstrate the robustness of the method applied to the estimation of curvature of quantized contours under variable scale, rotation, and partial occlusion. These results suggest the application of generalized cross-validation to other computer-vision algorithms involving regularization. >"

But the solution must not smooth over discontinuities in the image, and allowance must be made for the fact that the probability distributions of the smoothness measures are unknown. The authors apply the theory of robust statistics (M-statistics) to obtain a convex regularization that is also maximally robust against misspecification of the probability distribution of large jumps in the unknown. This theory is applied to the optical flow constraint, which is known to be noisy and inaccurate. The authors present some preliminary results showing that convex regularization theory seems to accurately preserve depth boundary information.<<ETX>>"

The author derives the most general form of such a smoothness constraint which is quadratic in first or second derivatives of the grey-level image intensity function, based on three simple assumptions about the smoothness constraint: (1) that it be expressed in a form which is independent of the choice of Cartesian coordinate system in the image; (2) that it be positive definite; and (3) that it not couple different components of the optical flow. It is shown that there are essentially only four such constraints; any smoothness constraint satisfying all three assumptions must be a linear combination of these four, possibly multipled by certain quantities of these four, possibly multipled by certain quantities invariant under a change in the Cartesian coordinate system. Beginning with the three assumptions mentioned above, the author mathematically demonstrates that all the best-known smoothness constraints appearing in the literature are special cases of this general form, and, in particular, that the 'weight matrix' introduced by H.-H. Nagel (1983) is essentially the only physically plausible such constraint.<<ETX>>"

A new theory for solving such problems is presented. Unlike the current heuristic methods, the method used starts from fundamental principles that should be followed by any reconstruction method, regardless of its mathematical or physical implementation. A mathematical procedure which conforms to these principles is presented. One major advantage of the method is the ability to handle shapes containing both smooth and sharp parts without using thresholds. A sharp variation, such as a corner, requires a high-resolution mesh for adequate representation, while slowly varying sections can be represented with sparser mesh points. Unlike current methods, this procedure fits the surface on a varying mesh. The mesh is constructed automatically to be more dense at parts of the image that have more rapid variation. Analytical examples are given in simple cases, followed by numerical experiments. >"

Shape matching is viewed as a ``segment matching'' problem. Unlike the previous work, the technique is based on a stochastic labeling procedure which explicitly maximizes a criterion function based on the ambiguity and inconsistency of classification. To reduce the computation time, the technique is hierarchical and uses results obtained at low levels to speed up and improve the accuracy of results at higher levels. This basic technique has been extended to the situation where various objects partially occlude each other to form an apparent object and our interest is to find all the objects participating in the occlusion. In such a case several hierarchical processes are executed in parallel for every object participating in the occlusion and are coordinated in such a way that the same segment of the apparent object is not matched to the segments of different actual objects. These techniques have been applied to two-dimensional simple closed curves represented by polygons and the power of the techniques is demonstrated by the examples taken from synthetic, aerial, industrial and biological images where the matching is done after using the actual segmentation methods."

The Kass et al.\u2019s algorithm involves four steps: setting up a variational integral on the continuous plane, deriving a pair of Euler equations, discretizing them, and solving the discrete equations iteratively until convergence. This algorithm suffers from a number of problems. We discuss these problems and present an algoIithm for active contours based on dynamic programming. The optimization problem is set up as a discrete multi-stage decision process and is solved by a \u201ctime-delayed\u201d discrete dynamic programming algorithm. This formulation leads to a stable behavior for the active contours over iterations, in addition to allowing for hard constraints to be enforced on the behavior of the solution.

A mathematical model encoding the figure-ground discrimination problem that makes explicit a definition of shape based on cocircularity, smoothness, proximity, and contrast is presented. This model consists of building a cost function on the basis of image element interactions. This cost function fits the constraints of an interacting spin system that, in turn, is a well suited physical model that solves hard combinatorial optimization problems. Two combinatorial optimization methods for solving the figure-ground problem, namely mean field annealing, which combines mean field approximation theory and annealing, and microcanonical annealing, are discussed. Mean field annealing may be viewed as a deterministic approximation of stochastic methods such as simulated annealing. The theoretical bases of these methods are described, and the computational models are derived. The efficiencies of mean field annealing, simulated annealing, and microcanonical annealing algorithms are compared. Within the framework of such a comparison, the figure-ground problem may be viewed as a benchmark. >"

We analyze the task requirements in terms of what information needs to be represented, how to represent it, what kind of paradigms can be used to process it, and how to implement the paradigms. We describe shape surfaces by curves and patches, which we represent by linear primitives, such as points, lines, and planes. Next we describe algo rithms to construct this representation from range data. We then propose the paradigm of recognizing objects while locat ing them. We analyze the basic constraint of rigidity that can be exploited, which we implement as a prediction and verifi cation scheme that makes efficient use of the representation. Results are presented for data obtained from a laser range finder, but both the shape representation and the matching algorithm are general and can be used for other types of data, such as ultrasound, stereo, and tactile."

Furthermore, discontinuities of any order of derivative can be detected by providing for continuous line processes, which selectively inhibit smoothing. Second- and higher-order networks are required for many problems in early vision; first-order networks are often unsatisfactory. Examples in surface interpolation, edge detection, and image segmentation are shown. Solution of these types of problems typically takes a prohibitive amount of time, even on supercomputers. A significant advantage of these proposed networks is that they can be mapped directly to analog VLSI hardware.<<ETX>>"

Their system takes as input dense range date and automatically produces a symbolic description of the objects in the scene in terms of their visible surface patches. This segmented representation may be viewed as a graph whose nodes capture information about the individual surface patches and whose links represent the relationships between them, such as occlusion and connectivity. On the basis of these relations, a graph for a given scene is decomposed into subgraphs corresponding to different objects. A model is represented by a set of such descriptions from multiple viewing angles, typically four to six. Models can therefore be acquired and represented automatically. Matching between the objects in a scene and the models is performed by three modules: the screener, in which the most likely candidate views for each object are found; the graph matcher, which compares the potential matching graphs and computes the 3-D transformation between them; and the analyzer, which takes a critical look at the results and proposes to split and merge object graphs. >"

It is well known that multigrid methods can improve significantly the convergence rate and the quality of the final results of iterative relaxation techniques. First, we present a classical multiscale model which consists of a label pyramid and a whole observation field. The potential functions of coarser grids are derived by simple computations. The optimization problem is first solved at the higher scale by a parallel relaxation algorithm; then the next lower scale is initialized by a projection of the result. Second, we propose a hierarchical Markov random field model based on this classical model. We introduce new interactions between neighbor levels in the pyramid. It can also be seen as a way to incorporate cliques with far apart sites for a reasonable price. This model results in a relaxation algorithm with a new annealing scheme: the multitemperature annealing (MTA) scheme, which consists of associating higher temperatures to higher levels, in order to be less sensitive to local minima at coarser grids. The convergence to the global optimum is proved by a generalization of the annealing theorem of S. Geman and D. Geman (IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell.6, 1984, 721\u2013741)."

The Hamiltonian used in the original model is minimized, but far more efficiently. The basis of microcanonical annealing is the Creutz algorithm. Unlike its counterpart, the familiar Metropolis algorithm, the Creutz algorithm simulates a thermally isolated system at equilibrium. The hierarchical control structure, together with a Brownian state-transition function, tracks ground states across scale, beginning with small, coarsely coded levels. Results are shown for a 512 \u00d7 512 pair with 50 pixels of disparity."

These cost or energy functions can be mapped onto very simple analog and binary resistive networks. Thus, we will see how the optical flow can be computed by injecting currents into \u201cneural\u201d networks and recording the resulting stationary voltage distribution at each node. These networks can be implemented in cMOS VLSI circuits and represent plausible candidates for biological vision systems."

An optimal recipe for classifying such patterns is described. It combines the use of an orthonormal expansion for the logarithm of probability functions, with the generation of a joint probability distribution from lower-order marginals. The unwieldy nature of the optimal recipe leads to the consideration of dependence represented by a Markov chain and a two-dimensional analog called a Markov mesh. The Markov chain has a \"reflecting\" property in that the r th order nonstationary chain implies that a point depends on its r nearest neighbors on each side. By scanning along a grid-filling curve so that the 2r neighbors of a point are geometrically close to it, certain spatial dependencies are obtained. The grid-filling curves are sequences of functions which have Hilbert \"space-filling\" curves as their limit. This simple approach does not provide for many of the spatial dependencies that should be considered. A novel extension of Markov chain methods into two dimensions leads to the Markov mesh which economically takes care of a much larger class of spatial dependencies. Likelihood ratio classification based on Markov chain and Markov mesh assumptions requires the estimation of a much smaller number of parameters than the general case. The development presented in this paper is new and need not be restricted to binary variables."

A second constraint is needed. A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. The algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization of brightness levels and additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption of smoothness is violated at singular points or along lines in the image."

Through regularization, they may be reformulated as well-posed variational principles whose solutions are computable. Standard regularization theory employs quadratic stabilizing functionals that impose global smoothness constraints on possible solutions. Discontinuities present serious difficulties to standard regularization, however, since their reconstruction requires a precise spatial control over the smoothing properties of stabilizers. This paper proposes a general class of controlled-continuity stabilizers which provide the necessary control over smoothness. These nonquadratic stabilizing functionals comprise multiple generalized spline kernels combined with (noncontinuous) continuity control functions. In the context of computational vision, they may be thought of as controlled-continuity constraints. These generic constraints are applicable to visual reconstruction problems that involve both continuous regions and discontinuities, for which global smoothness constraints fail."

Methods that have been proposed to deal with the problem include scale-space techniques that consider the behavior of the result across a continuum of scales. From the point of view of regulation theory, the concept of scale is related quite directly to the regularization parameter lambda . It suggested that methods used to obtained the optimal value of lambda may provide, either directly or after suitable modification, the optimal scale associated with the specific instance of certain problems. >"

The approach is to use three-dimensional models of the objects to find them in range data. The matching strategy starts with a distinctive edge feature, such as the edge at the end of a cylindrical part, and then \"grows\" a match by add ing compatible features one at a time. (The order of features to be considered is predetermined by an interactive, off-line, feature-selection process.) Once a sufficient number of com patible features has been detected to allow a hypothesis to be formed, the verification procedure evaluates it by comparing the measured range data with data predicted according to the hypothesis. When all the objects in the scene have been hy pothesized and verified in this manner, a configuration- understanding procedure determines which objects are on top of others by analyzing the patterns of range data predicted from all the hypotheses. We also present experimental results of the system's performance in recognizing and locating castings in a bin."

A critical, intermediate goal of edge detection is the detection and characterization of significant intensity changes. This paper discusses this part of the edge detection problem. To characterize the types of intensity changes derivatives of different types, and possibly different scales, are needed. Thus, we consider this part of edge detection as a problem in numerical differentiation. We show that numerical differentiation of images is an ill-posed problem in the sense of Hadamard. Differentiation needs to be regularized by a regularizing filtering operation before differentiation. This shows that this part of edge detection consists of two steps, a filtering step and a differentiation step. Following this perspective, the paper discusses in detail the following theoretical aspects of edge detection. 1) The properties of different types of filters-with minimal uncertainty, with a bandpass spectrum, and with limited support-are derived. Minimal uncertainty filters optimize a tradeoff between computational efficiency and regularizing properties. 2) Relationships among several 2-D differential operators are established. In particular, we characterize the relation between the Laplacian and the second directional derivative along the gradient. Zero crossings of the Laplacian are not the only features computed in early vision. 3) Geometrical and topological properties of the zero crossings of differential operators are studied in terms of transversality and Morse theory."

A binary matrix representation of signal is used in this paper. A nearest-neighbor dependence method is obtained by going beyond the usual assumption of statistical independence. The recognition network consists of three levels?a layer of AND gates, a set of linear summing networks in parallel, and a maximum selection circuit. Formulas for weights or recognition parameters are also derived, as logarithms of ratios of conditional probabilities. These formulas lead to a straightforward procedure of estimating weights from sample characters, which are then used in subsequent recognition. Simulation of the recognition method is performed on a digital computer. The program consists of two main operations-estimation of parameters from sample characters, and recognition using these estimated values. The experimental results indicate that the effect of neighbor dependence upon recognition performance is significant. On the basis of a rather small sample of 50 sets of hand-printed alphanumeric characters, the recognition performance of the nearest-neighbor method compares favorably with other recognition schemes."

The GNC model is generalized. Any number of constraints on the line processes can be added as a result of using the adiabatic approximation. The resulting algorithm is a combination of the conjugate gradient (CG) and the iterated conditional modes (ICM) algorithms and is completely deterministic.

The value of the regularization parameter depends on the variance of the noise in the data. The problem of choosing the regularization parameter and estimating the noise variance in image restoration is examined. An error analysis based on an objective mean-square-error (MSE) criterion is used to motivate regularization. Two approaches for choosing the regularization parameter and estimating the noise variance are proposed. The proposed and existing methods are compared and their relationship to linear minimum-mean-square-error filtering is examined. Experiments are presented that verify the theoretical results."

During the last two decades, the method of maximum likelihood has become the most widely followed approach to this problem, thanks primarily to the advent of high speed electronic computers. Here, we first offer a brief survey of the literature directed toward this problem and review maximum-likelihood estimation for it. We then turn to the subject of ultimate interest, which is a particular iterative procedure for numerically approximating maximum-likelihood estimates for mixture density problems. This procedure, known as the EM algorithm, is a specialization to the mixture density context of a general algorithm of the same name used to approximate maximum-likelihood estimates for incomplete data problems. We discuss the formulation and theoretical and practical properties of the EM algorithm for mixture densities, focussing in particular on ..."

The objects are modeled as polyhedra (or polygons) having up to six degrees of positional freedom relative to the sensors. The approach operates by examining all hypotheses about pairings between sensed data and object surfaces and efficiently discarding inconsistent ones by using local constraints on: distances between faces, angles between face normals, and angles (relative to the surface normals) of vectors between sensed points. The method described here is an extension of a method for recognition and localization of nonoverlapping parts previously described in [18] and [15]."

This definition in the homogeneous Gaussian case leads to a difference equation that sets forth the state of the field in terms of its values on a band of minimum width P , where P is the order of the process. The state of the field at position (i,j) is given by the set of values of the nearest neighbors within distance P of the point (i,j) . Conversely, given a difference equation satisfying certain conditions relating to stability, there corresponds a homogeneous discrete Markov random field.

Compatibility coefficients play an important role in the relaxation process. No explanation exists at present for their exact meaning, and no algorithm has been proposed to generate them. Some possible interpretations of these coefficients are presented, and algorithms are suggested to obtain them from the initial probabilistic labeling.

Important classes of Markov-type models, their properties, and their relationship are described. Although some new results are given, the authors mainly present a systematic study and grouping of processes according to two fundamental Markov-type properties: strict-sense Markov, defined in terms of conditional probabilities, and wide-sense Markov, defined in terms of linear minimum-mean-square error estimates. Classes of models having special cases of the fundamental properties, including many models which are widely used to represent images are obtained by specifying the index set, the conditioning set used to define the Markov property, and the process distribution. The relationships between unilateral and bilateral models in each class are carefully investigated. Particular attention is given to simultaneous autoregressive models which are shown to be both strict-sense and wide-sense Markov. Classification of processes according to their Markov-type properties helps to clarify the consequences of and relationships between different model assumptions. >"

A globally convergent iterative technique is given for the 2D-perspective-projection-3D pose estimation problem. A simplified linear solution and a robust solution to the 2D-perspective-projection-2D-perspective-projection pose-estimation problem are also given. Simulation experiments consisting of millions of trials with varying numbers of pairs of corresponding points and varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) with either Gaussian or uniform noise provide data suggesting that accurate inference of rotation and translation with noisy data may require corresponding point data sets with hundreds of corresponding point pairs when the SNR is less than 40 dB. The experimental results also show that the robust technique can suppress the blunder data which come from outliers or mismatched points. >"

The least square approach is derived to compute the rotation angle in the presence of noise. The advantage of such an approach is that no camera calibration is required.

We conclude that: 1) \"Orthodox\" sampling theory methods are useful in problems where we have a known model (sampling distribution) for the properties of the noise, but no appreciable prior information about the quantities being estimated. 2) MAXENT is optimal in problems where we have prior information about multiplicities, but no noise. 3) The full Bayesian solution includes both of these as special cases and is needed in problems where we have both prior information and noise. 4) AR models are in one sense a special case of MAXENT, but in another sense they are ubiquitous in all spectral analysis problems with discrete time series. 5) Empirical methods such as Blackman-Tukey, which do not invoke even a likelihood function, are useful in the preliminary, exploratory phase of a problem where our knowledge is sufficient to permit intuitive judgments about how to organize a calculation (smoothing, decimation, windows, prewhitening, padding with zeroes, etc.) but insufficient to set up a quantitative model which would do the proper things for us automatically and optimally."

                "text": "SummarySmoothing splines are well known to provide nice curves which smooth discrete, noisy data. We obtain a practical, effective method for estimating the optimum amount of smoothing from the data. Derivatives can be estimated from the data by differentiating the resulting (nearly) optimally smoothed spline.We consider the modelyi(ti)+\u03b5i,i=1, 2, ...,n,ti\u2208[0, 1], whereg\u2208W2(m)={f:f,f\u2032, ...,f(m\u22121) abs. cont.,f(m)\u2208\u21122[0,1]}, and the {\u03b5i} are random errors withE\u03b5i=0,E\u03b5i\u03b5j=\u03c32\u03b4ij. The error variance \u03c32 may be unknown. As an estimate ofg we take the solutiongn, \u03bb to the problem: Findf\u2208W2(m) to minimize\n$$\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^n {(f(t_j ) - y_j )^2 + \\lambda \\int\\limits_0^1 {(f^{(m)} (u))^2 du} }$$\n. The functiongn, \u03bb is a smoothing polynomial spline of degree 2m\u22121. The parameter \u03bb controls the tradeoff between the \u201croughness\u201d of the solution, as measured by\n$$\\int\\limits_0^1 {[f^{(m)} (u)]^2 du}$$\n, and the infidelity to the data as measured by\n$$\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^n {(f(t_j ) - y_j )^2 }$$\n, and so governs the average square errorR(\u03bb; g)=R(\u03bb) defined by\n$$R(\\lambda ) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^n {(g_{n,\\lambda } (t_j ) - g(t_j ))^2 }$$\n. We provide an estimate\n$$\\hat \\lambda$$\n, called the generalized cross-validation estimate, for the minimizer ofR(\u03bb). The estimate\n$$\\hat \\lambda$$\n is the minimizer ofV(\u03bb) defined by\n$$V(\\lambda ) = \\frac{1}{n}\\parallel (I - A(\\lambda ))y\\parallel ^2 /\\left[ {\\frac{1}{n}{\\text{Trace(}}I - A(\\lambda ))} \\right]^2$$\n, wherey=(y1, ...,yn)t andA(\u03bb) is then\u00d7n matrix satisfying(gn, \u03bb (t1), ...,gn, \u03bb (tn))t=A (\u03bb) y. We prove that there exist a sequence of minimizers\n$$\\tilde \\lambda = \\tilde \\lambda (n)$$\n ofEV(\u03bb), such that as the (regular) mesh{ti}i=1n becomes finer,\n$$\\mathop {\\lim }\\limits_{n \\to \\infty } ER(\\tilde \\lambda )/\\mathop {\\min }\\limits_\\lambda ER(\\lambda ) \\downarrow 1$$\n. A Monte Carlo experiment with several smoothg's was tried withm=2,n=50 and several values of \u03c32, and typical values of\n$$R(\\hat \\lambda )/\\mathop {\\min }\\limits_\\lambda R(\\lambda )$$\n were found to be in the range 1.01\u20131.4. The derivativeg\u2032 ofg can be estimated by\n$$g'_{n,\\hat \\lambda } (t)$$\n. In the Monte Carlo examples tried, the minimizer of\n$$R_D (\\lambda ) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^n {(g'_{n,\\lambda } (t_j ) - } g'(t_j ))$$\n tended to be close to the minimizer ofR(\u03bb), so that\n$$\\hat \\lambda$$\n was also a good value of the smoothing parameter for estimating the derivative."

In practice, the sites may represent points or regions in space and the random variables may be either continuous or discrete. The main statistical objectives are the following: firstly, to provide a means of using the available concomitant information, particularly the configuration of the sites, to attach a plausible probability distribution to the random vector X; secondly, to estimate any unknown parameters in the distribution from the realization x; thirdly, where possible, to quantify the extent of disagreement between hypothesis and observation."

Optimizations using energy methods yield \"forces\" which act upon the state of the neural network. The penalty method, in which quadratic energy constraints are added to an existing optimization energy, has become popular recently, but is not guaranteed to satisfy the constraint conditions when there are other forces on the neural model or when there are multiple constraints. In this paper, we present the basic differential multiplier method (BDMM), which satisfies constraints exactly; we create forces which gradually apply the constraints over time, using \"neurons\" that estimate Lagrange multipliers. \n \nThe basic differential multiplier method is a differential version of the method of multipliers from Numerical Analysis. We prove that the differential equations locally converge to a constrained minimum. \n \nExamples of applications of the differential method of multipliers include enforcing permutation codewords in the analog decoding problem and enforcing valid tours in the traveling salesman problem."

The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples."

Roughly, a random field with denumerable state space S is described by a probability measure \u03bc on the space \u03a9 = S T of all configurations of values from S on the generalized time set T. In this chapter we discuss certain extensions of Markov chains, called Markov fields which have been important objects of study in the recent development of probability theory. Only some of the highlights of this rich theory will be covered; we concentrate especially on the case T = \u2124 = the integers, where the connections with classical Markov chain theory are deepest."

By interpreting an ensemble of attributed graphs as the outcomes of a random graph, we can use its lower order distribution to characterize the ensemble. To reflect the variability of a random graph, Shannon's entropy measure is used. To synthesize an ensemble of attributed graphs into the distribution of a random graph (or a set of distributions), we propose a distance measure between random graphs based on the minimum change of entropy before and after their merging. When the ensemble contains more than one class of pattern graphs, the synthesis process yields distributions corresponding to various classes. This process corresponds to unsupervised learning in pattern classification. Using the maximum likelihood rule and the probability computed for the pattern graph, based on its matching with the random graph distributions of different classes, we can classify the pattern graph to a class."

For certain values of the coefficients, some processes will have a single nontrivial convergence point regardless of the initial labeling. For other choices of the coefficients, there can be more than one possible convergence point, and different solutions can be obtained for different initial labelings. In the probabilistic approach where the coefficients are predefined in terms of joint probabilities, there are always two nontrivial convergence points for all possible coefficients. The results are also compared to the Bayesian analysis that can be obtained in this simple case of two nodes. Since certain selections of coefficients can give unacceptable results even in this simple case, it can be expected that the proper selection of coefficients will be much more important in the general case involving larger numbers of nodes and labels."

The content- addressable memory and other emergent collective properties of the original model also are present in the graded response model. The idea that such collective properties are used in biological systems is given added credence by the continued presence of such properties for more nearly biological \"neurons.\" Collective analog electrical circuits of the kind described will certainly function. The collective states of the two models have a simple correspondence. The original model will continue to be useful for simulations, because its connection to graded response systems is established.

Unlike many generalizations of the univariate median, repeated median estimates maintain the high 50% breakdown value and can resist the effects of outliers even when they comprise nearly half of the data. Because they are calculated directly, not iteratively, repeated median procedures can be used as starting values for iterative robust estimation methods. For bivariate linear regression with symmetric errors, repeated median estimates are unbiased and Fisher consistent, and their efficiency under Gaussian sampling can be comparable to the efficiency of the univariate median.

This paper proposes to use the continuous relaxation labeling (RL) method for the minimization. The RL converts the original NP complete problem into one of polynomial complexity. Annealing may be combined into the RL process to improve the quality (globalness) of RL solutions. Performance comparison among four different RL algorithms is given."

The basic idea is not only to take into account {\\em how much} of an object can be seen in the image, but also {\\em what parts} of it are jointly present. I show that this additional information can improve the specificity (i.e., reduce the probability of false positive matches) of a recognition algorithm. I demonstrate formally that most commonly used quality of match measures employed by recognition algorithms are based on an independence assumption. Using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle and a simple scene-description language as a guide, I show that this independence assumption is not satisfied for common scenes, and propose several important higher-order statistical properties of matches that approximate some aspects of these statistical dependencies. I have implemented a recognition system that takes advantage of this additional statistical information and demonstrate its efficacy in comparisons with a standard recognition system based on bounded error matching. We also observe that the existing use of grouping and segmentation methods has significant effects on the performance of recognition systems that are similar to those resulting from the use of higher-order statistical information. Our analysis provides a statistical framework in which to understand the effects of grouping and segmentation on recognition and suggests ways to take better advantage of such information."
