It enables systematic development of optimal vision algorithms when used with optimization principles. This detailed and thoroughly enhanced third edition presents a comprehensive study / reference to theories, methodologies and recent developments in solving computer vision problems based on MRFs, statistics and optimisation. It treats various problems in low- and high-level computational vision in a systematic and unified way within the MAP-MRF framework. Among the main issues covered are: how to use MRFs to encode contextual constraints that are indispensable to image understanding; how to derive the objective function for the optimal solution to a problem; and how to design computational algorithms for finding an optimal solution. Easy-to-follow and coherent, the revised edition is accessible, includes the most recent advances, and has new and expanded sections on such topics as: Discriminative Random Fields (DRF) Strong Random Fields (SRF) Spatial-Temporal Models Total Variation Models Learning MRF for Classification (motivation + DRF) Relation to Graphic Models Graph Cuts Belief Propagation Features: Focuses on the application of Markov random fields to computer vision problems, such as image restoration and edge detection in the low-level domain, and object matching and recognition in the high-level domain Presents various vision models in a unified framework, including image restoration and reconstruction, edge and region segmentation, texture, stereo and motion, object matching and recognition, and pose estimation Uses a variety of examples to illustrate how to convert a specific vision problem involving uncertainties and constraints into essentially an optimization problem under the MRF setting Introduces readers to the basic concepts, important models and various special classes of MRFs on the regular image lattice and MRFs on relational graphs derived from images Examines the problems of parameter estimation and function optimization Includes an extensive list of references This broad-ranging and comprehensive volume is an excellent reference for researchers working in computer vision, image processing, statistical pattern recognition and applications of MRFs. It has been class-tested and is suitable as a textbook for advanced courses relating to these areas."

In statistical image segmentation, the model is generally defined by the probability distribution of the class field, which is assumed to be a Markov field, and the probability distributions of the observations field conditional to the class field. In such models the segmentation of textured images is difficult to perform and one has to resort to some model approximations. The originality of our contribution is to consider the Markovianity of the pair (class field observations field). We obtain a different model; in particular, the class field is not necessarily a Markov field. The model proposed makes possible the use of Bayesian methods like MPM or MAP to segment textured images with no model approximations. In addition, the textured images can be corrupted with correlated noise. Some first simulations to validate the model proposed are also presented."

Data mining applications often operate in the domain of high dimensional features where the tradeoffs between informative and discriminative classifiers are especially relevant.

Conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."

In Bayesian image analysis, this requires fusing together local predictions for the class labels with a prior model of label images. Following the work of Bouman and Shapiro (1994), we consider the use of tree-structured belief networks (TSBNs) as prior models. The parameters in the TSBN are trained using a maximum-likelihood objective function with the EM algorithm and the resulting model is evaluated by calculating how efficiently it codes label images. A number of authors have used Gaussian mixture models to connect the label field to the image data. We compare this approach to the scaled-likelihood method of Smyth (1994) and Morgan and Bourlard (1995), where local predictions of pixel classification from neural networks are fused with the TSBN prior. Our results show a higher performance is obtained with the neural networks. We evaluate the classification results obtained and emphasize not only the maximum a posteriori segmentation, but also the uncertainty, as evidenced e.g., by the pixelwise posterior marginal entropies. We also investigate the use of conditional maximum-likelihood training for the TSBN and find that this gives rise to improved classification performance over the ML-trained TSBN."

Generally, these methods tend to offer improved segmentation accuracy with reduced computational burden. Existing Bayesian segmentation methods use simple models of context designed to encourage large uniformly classified regions. Consequently, these context models have a limited ability to capture the complex contextual dependencies that are important in applications such as document segmentation. We propose a multiscale Bayesian segmentation algorithm which can effectively model complex aspects of both local and global contextual behavior. The model uses a Markov chain in scale to model the class labels that form the segmentation, but augments this Markov chain structure by incorporating tree based classifiers to model the transition probabilities between adjacent scales. The tree based classifier models complex transition rules with only a moderate number of parameters. One advantage to our segmentation algorithm is that it can be trained for specific segmentation applications by simply providing examples of images with their corresponding accurate segmentations. This makes the method flexible by allowing both the context and the image models to be adapted without modification of the basic algorithm. We illustrate the value of our approach with examples from document segmentation in which test, picture and background classes must be separated."

The proposed approach uses a causal multiscale random field suggested by Bouman and Shapiro (1994) as a prior model on the class labels on the image sites. However, instead of assuming the conditional independence of the observed data, we propose to capture the local dependencies in the data using a multiscale feature vector. The distribution of the multiscale feature vectors is modeled as mixture of Gaussians. A set of robust multi-scale features is presented that captures the general statistical properties of man-made structures at multiple scales without relying on explicit edge detection. The proposed approach was validated on real-world images from the Corel data set, and a performance comparison with other techniques is presented."

However, few priors aim at achieving \"sparse\" classifiers, where irrelevant/redundant parameters are automatically set to zero. Two well-known ways of obtaining sparse classifiers are: use a zero-mean Laplacian prior on the parameters, and the \"support vector machine\" (SVM). Whether one uses a Laplacian prior or an SVM, one still needs to specify/estimate the parameters that control the degree of sparseness of the resulting classifiers. We propose a Bayesian approach to learning sparse classifiers which does not involve any parameters controlling the degree of sparseness. This is achieved by a hierarchical-Bayes interpretation of the Laplacian prior, followed by the adoption of a Jeffreys' non-informative hyper-prior Implementation is carried out by an EM algorithm. Experimental evaluation of the proposed method shows that it performs competitively with (often better than) the best classification techniques available."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

Smith in the Chair] SUMMARY A continuous two-dimensional region is partitioned into a fine rectangular array of sites or \"pixels\", each pixel having a particular \"colour\" belonging to a prescribed finite set. The true colouring of the region is unknown but, associated with each pixel, there is a possibly multivariate record which conveys imperfect information about its colour according to a known statistical model. The aim is to reconstruct the true scene, with the additional knowledge that pixels close together tend to have the same or similar colours. In this paper, it is assumed that the local characteristics of the true scene can be represented by a nondegenerate Markov random field. Such information can be combined with the records by Bayes' theorem and the true scene can be estimated according to standard criteria. However, the computational burden is enormous and the reconstruction may reflect undesirable largescale properties of the random field. Thus, a simple, iterative method of reconstruction is proposed, which does not depend on these large-scale characteristics. The method is illustrated by computer simulations in which the original scene is not directly related to the assumed random field. Some complications, including parameter estimation, are discussed. Potential applications are mentioned briefly."

The novel feature of one form of the model is that it is able to segment images containing unknown numbers of regions, where there may be significant variation of properties within each region. The estimation algorithms used are stochastic, but because of the multiresolution representation, are fast computationally, requiring only a few iterations per pixel to converge to accurate results, with error rates of 1-2 percent across a range of image structures and textures. The addition of a simple boundary process gives accurate results even at low resolutions, and consequently at very low computational cost."

This specification differs from others in several important respects. Firstly, we ensure internal consistency by distinguishing between directly and indirectly interacting objects. Secondly, we avoid certain problems of interpretation and meaning by regarding the iterative updating of probabilities as a filtering process on the measurements for objects. Finally, we overcome the problem of the exponential complexity of the resulting evidence combining formula by deriving practical support functions of at most polynomial complexity. The computational realisation of the advocated approach to combining evidence is demonstrated for the application of edge labelling. This application includes details of how both the measurement generation process and the world-model may be expressed probabilistically and what the advantages are to be gained from using different forms of support-function."

Their interest was in assessing the performance of algorithms used to find the MAP state, such as simulated annealing. A secondary conclusion was that the MAP state, at least in the restricted setting of two-color images, does not provide a robust reconstruction of the true image. That result has been interpreted by some as indicating that the Ising MRF used by GPS is not a good prior model for such images. We show that such a judgement is premature as the MAP state does not well summarize the information in the posterior distribution in this case. In particular, the deviation of the MAP state from the mean, particularly at larger smoothing parameters, shows that the MAP state is not representative of the bulk of feasible reconstructions. We calculate other summary statistics that interpret and display the information in the posterior by implementing full Bayesian infe..."

Each of these techniques constructs a graph such that the minimum cut on the graph also minimizes the energy. Yet, because these graph constructions are complex and highly specific to a particular energy function, graph cuts have seen limited application to date. In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph. A software implementation is freely available."

                "text": "Displayed ultrasound (US) B-mode images often exhibit tissue intensity inhomogeneities dominated by nonuniform beam attenuation within the body. This is a major problem for intensity-based, automatic segmentation of video-intensity images because conventional threshold-based or intensity-statistic-based approaches do not work well in the presence of such image distortions. Time gain compensation (TGC) is typically used in standard US machines in an attempt to overcome this. However this compensation method is position-dependent which means that different tissues in the same TGC time-range (or corresponding depth range) will be, incorrectly, compensated by the same amount. Compensation should really be tissue-type dependent but automating this step is difficult. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a method for simultaneous estimation of video-intensity inhomogeneities and segmentation of US image tissue regions. The method uses a combination of the maximum a posteriori (MAP) and Markov random field (MRF) methods to estimate the US image distortion field assuming it follows a multiplicative model while at the same time labeling image regions based on the corrected intensity statistics. The MAP step is used to estimate the intensity model parameters while the MRF step provides a novel way of incorporating the distributions of image tissue classes as a spatial smoothness constraint. We explain how this multiplicative model can be related to the ultrasonic physics of image formation to justify our approach. Experiments are presented on synthetic images and a gelatin phantom to evaluate quantitatively the accuracy of the method. We also discuss qualitatively the application of the method to clinical breast and cardiac US images. Limitations of the method and potential clinical applications are outlined in the conclusion."

The resulting decision rule is defined in terms of transition probabilities between pairs of neighboring pixels. Experimental evaluation of the rule confirms its superiority over the conventional Bayes rule and provides justification for the assumption made."
