If these text occurrences could be detected, segmented, and recognized automatically, they would be a valuable source of high-level semantics for indexing and retrieval. We propose a novel method for localizing and segmenting text in complex images and videos. Text lines are identified by using a complex-valued multilayer feed-forward network trained to detect text at a fixed scale and position. The network's output at all scales and positions is integrated into a single text-saliency map, serving as a starting point for candidate text lines. In the case of video, these candidate text lines are refined by exploiting the temporal redundancy of text in video. Localized text lines are then scaled to a fixed height of 100 pixels and segmented into a binary image with black characters on white background. For videos, temporal redundancy is exploited to improve segmentation performance. Input images and videos can be of any size due to a true multiresolution approach. Moreover, the system is not only able to locate and segment text occurrences into large binary images, but is also able to track each text line with sub-pixel accuracy over the entire occurrence in a video, so that one text bitmap is created for all instances of that text line. Therefore, our text segmentation results can also be used for object-based video encoding such as that enabled by MPEG-4."

                "text": "There are many applications in which the automatic detection and recognition of text embedded in images is useful. These applications include digad libraries, multimedia systems, and Geographical Information Systems. When machine generated text is prdnted against clean backgrounds, it can be converted to a computer readable form (ASCII) using current Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. However, text is often printed against shaded or textured backgrounds or is embedded in images. Examples include maps, advertisements, photographs, videos and stock certificates. Current document segmentation and recognition technologies cannot handle these situafons well. In this paper, a four-step system which automaticnlly detects and extracts text in images i& proposed. First, a texture segmentation scheme is used to focus attention on regions where text may occur. Second, strokes are extracted from the segmented text regions. Using reasonable heuristics on text strings such as height similarity, spacing and alignment, the extracted strokes are then processed to form rectangular boxes surrounding the corresponding ttzt strings. To detect text over a wide range of font sizes, the above steps are first applied to a pyramid of images generated from the input image, and then the boxes formed at each resolution level of the pyramid are fused at the image in the original resolution level. Third, text is extracted by cleaning up the background and binarizing the detected ted strings. Finally, better text bounding boxes are generated by srsiny the binarized text as strokes. Text is then cleaned and binarized from these new boxes, and can then be passed through a commercial OCR engine for recognition if the text is of an OCR-recognizable font. The system is stable, robust, and works well on imayes (with or without structured layouts) from a wide van\u2019ety of sources, including digitized video frames, photographs, *This material is based on work supported in part by the National Science Foundation, Library of Congress and Department of Commerce under cooperative agreement number EEC9209623, in part by the United States Patent and mademark Office and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency/IT0 under ARPA order number D468, issued by ESC/AXS contract number F19628-96-C-0235, in part by the National Science Foundation under grant number IF&9619117 and in part by NSF Multimedia CDA-9502639.

We propose a new text detection and segmentation algorithm that is especially designed for being applied to color images with complicated background. Our goal is to minimize the number of false alarms and to binarize efficiently the detected text areas so that they can be processed by standard OCR software. First, potential areas of text are detected by enhancement and clustering processes, considering most of constraints related to the texture of words. Then, classification and binarization of potential text areas are achieved in a single scheme performing color quantization and characters periodicity analysis. We report a high rate of good detection results with very few false alarms and reliable text binarization."

An algorithm which will automatically locate the textual regions in the input image will facilitate this task; the optical character recognizer can then be applied to only those regions of the image which contain text. We present a method for automatically locating text in complex color images. The algorithm first finds the approximate locations of text lines using horizontal spatial variance, and then extracts text components in these boxes using color segmentation. The proposed method has been used to locate text in compact disc (CD) and book cover images, as well as in the images of traffic scenes captured by a video camera. Initial results are encouraging and suggest that these algorithms can be used in image retrieval applications."

As a result, we get segmented characters from video pictures. These can be parsed by any OCR software. The recognition results of multiple instances of the same character throughout subsequent frames are combined to enhance recognition result and to compute the final output. We have tested our segmentation algorithms in a series of experiments with video clips recorded from television and achieved good segmentation results."

In conventional methods, gray image binarization processing with a given threshold is employed to extract high-intensity video character regions. A video has a complex background with various kinds of intensity so that appropriate thresholds are not always obtained. The proposed method extracts reliable high-intensity regions in a video text region and then expands them in order to make the whole video character regions. The experiments show this new method to be superior to the conventional methods."

To reduce the amount of small variations in color, a clustering algorithm is applied in a preprocessing step. Two methods have been developed for extracting text hypotheses. One is based on a top-down analysis using successive splitting of image regions. The other is a bottom-up region growing algorithm. The results of both methods are combined to robustly distinguish between text and non-text elements. Text elements are binarized using automatically extracted information about text color. The binarized text regions can be used as input for a conventional OCR module. Results are shown for parts of book and journal covers of different complexity. The proposed method is not restricted to cover pages, but can be applied to the extraction of text from other types of color images as well."

News captions generally provide vital search information about the video being presented, the names of people and places or descriptions of objects. In this paper, two difficult problems of character recognition for videos are addressed: low resolution characters and extremely complex backgrounds. We apply an interpolation filter, multi-frame integration and a combination of four filters to solve these problems. Segmenting characters is done by a recognition-based segmentation method and intermediate character recognition results are used to improve the segmentation. The overall recognition results are good enough for use in news indexing. Performing video OCR on news video and combining its results with other video understanding techniques will improve the overall understanding of the news video content."

News captions generally provide vital search information about the video being presented { the names of people and places or descriptions of objects. In this paper, two di cult problems of character recognition for videos are addressed: low resolution characters and extremely complex backgrounds. We apply an interpolation lter, multi-frame integration and a combination of four lters to solve these problems. Segmenting characters is done by a recognition-based segmentation method and intermediate character recognition results are used to improve the segmentation. The overall recognition results are good enough for use in news indexing. Performing Video OCR on news video and combining its results with other video understanding techniques will improve the overall understanding of the news video content."

In this paper we propose a new method to normalize the contrast between text characters and backgrounds so that a trained machine learning tool can verify characters of grayscale values that have never been seen before. Experiments show that the proposed method used in training either a multilayer perceptrons or a support vector machine yields better text verification comparing with other typical contrast measures."

This research addresses the problem of finding pictures. The fact that images do not appear in isolation, but rather with accompanying, collateral text is exploited. Taken independently, existing techniques for picture retrieval using (i) text-based and (ii) image-based methods have several limitations. This research presents a general model for multimodal information retrieval that addresses the following issues: (i) users' information need, (ii) expressing information need through composite, multimodal queries, and (iii) determining the most appropriate weighted combination of indexing techniques in order to best satisfy information need. A machine learning approach is proposed for the latter. The focus is on improving precision and recall in a MMIR system by optimally combining text and image similarity. Experiments are presented which demonstrate the utility of individual indexing systems in improving overall average precision."

The contrast of text in video can then be increased by enhancing the edges of only those stripes found to correspond to a suitable scale.

The resulting enhancement yields much better performance from the binarization process, which is the step required before character recognition."

We propose a method to extract the significant audio and video information and create a \u201cskim\u201d video which represents a short synopsis of the original. The extraction of significant information, such as specific objects, audio keywords and relevant video structure, is made possible through the integration of techniques in image and language understanding. The resulting skim is much smaller, and retains the essential content of the original segment. This research is sponsored by the National Science Foundation under grant no.

First character neighborhoods are extracted from input images using a global thresholding value that is shifted to the background pixel value from the thresholding value of conventional global binarization. Second, characters are extracted using an original local binarization process integrated with image interpolation. Our method takes only 1/100 the processing time over the method that performs image interpolation first. Therefore our method binarizes an A4 size text image (150dpi) in an average of only 3.3 seconds using a 166 MHz Pentium processor. Furthermore, our method reduced unrecognized characters by 46.5%, compared with conventional global binarization."

Using some features like texture, color and shape, we can associate a feature vector to every image in the database. A fast indexing method then can be used to retrieve similar images based on their associated vectors. We use the maxima of curvature zero crossing contours of Curvature Scale Space (CSS) image as a feature vector to represent the shapes of object boundary contours. The matching algorithm which compares two sets of maxima and assigns a matching value as a measure of similarity is presented in this paper. The method is robust with respect to noise, scale and orientation changes of objects. It is also capable to retrieve objects which are similar to the mirror-image of the input boundary. We introduce the aspect ratio of the CSS image as a new parameter which can be used for indexing in conjunction with other parameters like eccentricity and circularity. The method has been tested and evaluated on a prototype database of 450 images of marine animals with a vast variety of shapes with very good results. Since shape similarity is a subjective issue, in order to evaluate the method, we asked a number of volunteers to perform similarity retrieval based on shape on a randomly selected small database. We then compared the results of this experiment to the outputs of our system to the same queries and on the same database. The comparison indicated a promising performance of the system."

To achieve this aim, new kinds of vision algorithms need to be developed which run in real time and subserve the robot's goals. Two fundamental goals are determining the location of a known object. Color can be successfully used for both tasks.This article demonstrates that color histograms of multicolored objects provide a robust, efficient cue for indexing into a large database of models. It shows that color histograms are stable object representations in the presence of occlusion and over change in view, and that they can differentiate among a large number of objects. For solving the identification problem, it introduces a technique calledHistogram Intersection, which matches model and image histograms and a fast incremental version of Histogram Intersection, which allows real-time indexing into a large database of stored models. For solving the location problem it introduces an algorithm calledHistogram Backprojection, which performs this task efficiently in crowded scenes."

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

The focus of this paper is on the image processing aspects and in particular using texture information for browsing and retrieval of large image data. We propose the use of Gabor wavelet features for texture analysis and provide a comprehensive experimental evaluation. Comparisons with other multiresolution texture features using the Brodatz texture database indicate that the Gabor features provide the best pattern retrieval accuracy. An application to browsing large air photos is illustrated."

In the RBF case, the SV algorithm automatically determines centers, weights, and threshold that minimize an upper bound on the expected test error. The present study is devoted to an experimental comparison of these machines with a classical approach, where the centers are determined by X-means clustering, and the weights are computed using error backpropagation. We consider three machines, namely, a classical RBF machine, an SV machine with Gaussian kernel, and a hybrid system with the centers determined by the SV method and the weights trained by error backpropagation. Our results show that on the United States postal service database of handwritten digits, the SV machine achieves the highest recognition accuracy, followed by the hybrid system. The SV approach is thus not only theoretically well-founded but also superior in a practical application."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

Many authors have produced more robust versions of this estimator by replacing the square by something else, such as the absolute value. In this article a different approach is introduced in which the sum is replaced by the median of the squared residuals. The resulting estimator can resist the effect of nearly 50% of contamination in the data. In the special case of simple regression, it corresponds to finding the narrowest strip covering half of the observations. Generalizations are possible to multivariate location, orthogonal regression, and hypothesis testing in linear models."

However, the conceptual and theoretical background of train-speed restriction is unclear. In this paper, the buckling probability evaluation pro-gram(ProCWR) developed by this researchers was improved to take maximum and minimum buckling temperature into account for the calculation of allowable temperature. From the theoretical background of the international research and the buckling probability considering domestic railroad conditions, the validity and reliability of Korean high-speed train speed reduction scheme were investigated."
