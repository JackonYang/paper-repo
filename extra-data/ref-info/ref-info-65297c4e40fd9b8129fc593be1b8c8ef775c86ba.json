We develop a robust estimation framework for improving the reliability of motion estimates and an incremental minimization framework for recovering flow estimates over time. \nAttempts to improve the robustness of optical flow have focused on detecting and accounting for motion discontinuities in the optical flow field. We show that motion discontinuities are one example of a more general class of model violations and that by formulating the optical flow problem as one of robust estimation the problems posed by motion discontinuities can be reduced, and the violations can be detected. Additionally, robust estimation provides a powerful framework for early vision problems that generalizes the popular \"line process\" approaches. \nWe formulate a temporal continuity constraint, which reflects the fact that the motion of a surface changes gradually over time. We exploit this constraint to develop a new incremental minimization framework and show how it is related to standard recursive estimation techniques. Within this framework we implement two incremental algorithms for minimizing non-convex objective functions over time; Incremental Stochastic Minimization (ISM) and Incremental Graduated Non-Convexity (IGNC). \nWith this approach, motion estimates are always available; they are refined over time, the algorithm adapts to scene changes, and the amount of computation between frames is kept fixed. The psychophysical implications of temporal continuity are discussed and the power of the incremental minimization framework is demonstrated by extending image feature extraction over time."

A second constraint is needed. A method for finding the optical flow pattern is presented which assumes that the apparent velocity of the brightness pattern varies smoothly almost everywhere in the image. An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences. The algorithm is robust in that it can handle image sequences that are quantized rather coarsely in space and time. It is also insensitive to quantization of brightness levels and additive noise. Examples are included where the assumption of smoothness is violated at singular points or along lines in the image."

This problem is typical of ill-conditioned inverse problems that frequently arise in low-level computer vision. A conventional method to stabilize the problem is to introduce a priori constraints on X/sup 0/ and design a cost functional H(X) over images X, which is a weighted average of the prior constraints (regularization term) and posterior constraints (data term); the reconstruction is then the image X, which minimizes H. A prominent weakness in this approach, especially with quadratic-type stabilizers, is the difficulty in recovering discontinuities. The authors therefore examine prior smoothness constraints of a different form, which permit the recovery of discontinuities without introducing auxiliary variables for marking the location of jumps and suspending the constraints in their vicinity. In this sense, discontinuities are addressed implicitly rather than explicitly. >"

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."
