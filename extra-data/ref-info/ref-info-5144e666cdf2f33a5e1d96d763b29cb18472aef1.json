Crucial information about three-dimensional structure is provided by the spatial distribution of surface markings, particularly for static monocular views: projection distorts texture geometry in a manner tha depends systematically on surface shape and orientation. To isolate and measure this projective distortion in an image is to recover the three dimensional structure of the textured surface. For natural textures, we show that the uniform density assumption (texels are uniformly distributed) is enough to recover the orientation of a single textured plane in view, under perspective projection. Furthermore, when the texels cannot be found, the edges of the image are enough to determine shape, under a more general assumption, that the sum of the lengths of the contours on the world plane is about the same everywhere. Finally, several experimental results for synthetic and natural images are presented."

An expression showing the dependence of localized image spectral moments on localized surface spectral moments and on local surface orientation is derived. The local image spectra are measured with wavelets, and the expression is solved for the surface orientation at each point. Because the method uses localized spectral information, it operates at a very low level in the visual hierarchy. No extraction of texture or edge elements is required. The wavelet-based computation used is biologically plausible, easily parallelized for rapid computation, and has been shown to be the basis for effective solutions to a variety of other vision tasks. The method is demonstrated on a number of real-world examples.<<ETX>>"

Witkin's (1987) maximum-likelihood algorithm for shape from texture. The method is based on analysis of the directional statistics of the input data. It can be applied to both smooth curves and polygons, open or closed curves, symmetric figures, and scattered texture edges; thus, it appears to have wider applicability than previous methods. The weak isotropy heuristic captures many important properties (such as various types of symmetry) of both random and regular planar shape, and it also leads to a computationally efficient estimation algorithm based on observables in the image which are direct correlates of the surface orientation. These correlates make it possible to compute an approximate estimate of surface orientation in a single step. In certain simple cases this first estimate is exactly right, and in experiments with natural images it is typically within 5 degrees of the final estimate.<<ETX>>"

The model consists of three stages: (1) the image is convolved with a bank of even-symmetric linear filters followed by half-wave rectification to give a set of responses; (2) inhibition, localized in space, within and among the neural response profiles results in the suppression of weak responses when there are strong responses at the same or nearby locations; and (3) texture boundaries are detected using peaks in the gradients of the inhibited response profiles. The model is precisely specified, equally applicable to grey-scale and binary textures, and is motivated by detailed comparison with psychophysics and physiology. It makes predictions about the degree of discriminability of different texture pairs which match very well with experimental measurements of discriminability in human observers. From a machine-vision point of view, the scheme is a high-quality texture-edge detector which works equally on images of artificial and natural scenes. The algorithm makes the use of simple local and parallel operations, which makes it potentially real-time.<<ETX>>"

Size variations of image structures can occur for several reasons, e.g. because the world contains objects of different physical size, because surface textures contain structures at different scales, and because of perspective effects and noise in the image formation process. A proper representation of scale is essential to most visual tasks requiring stable descriptors of image structure.

The basic idea behind the algorithm is to use an oriented filter, namely the gradient of the Gaussian, and perform manipulations on the resulting gradient vector field. The most important aspect of the algorithm is that it is provably optimal in estimating the local orientations of an oriented texture. An added strength of the algorithm is that it is simpler and has a better signal-to-noise ratio than previous approaches, because it utilizes fewer derivative operations. Also proposed is a measure of coherence which is based on the use of the angle and coherence images as intrinsic images. An analysis of oriented textures requires the computation of these intrinsic images as a first step. In this sense, the computation of the orientation field, resulting in the intrinsic images, is indispensable in the analysis of oriented textures. Results from a number of experiments indicate the usefulness of the angle and coherence intrinsic images.<<ETX>>"

The theory is developed for the case when such orientation computations are necessary at all local neighborhoods of the n-dimensional Euclidean space. Detection of orientation is shown to correspond to fitting an axis or a plane to the Fourier transform of an n-dimensional structure. The solution of this problem is related to the solution of a well-known matrix eigenvalue problem. The computations can be performed in the spatial domain without actually doing a Fourier transformation. Along with the orientation estimate, a certainty measure, based on the error of the fit, is proposed. Two applications in image analysis are considered: texture segmentation and optical flow. The theory is verified by experiments which confirm accurate orientation estimates and reliable certainty measures in the presence of noise. The comparative results indicate that the theory produces algorithms computing robust texture features as well as optical flow. >"

It is shown that the 'no new maxima should be generated at coarse scales' property of conventional scale space is preserved. As the region boundaries in the approach remain sharp, a high-quality edge detector which successfully exploits global information is obtained. Experimental results are shown on a number of images. Parallel hardware implementations are made feasible because the algorithm involves elementary, local operations replicated over the image. >"

The goal is to relate the results of this analysis to the structure of the picture, which is determined by the physics of the image generation process. Candidates for contour points are the maximal magnitudes of the gray-value gradient for different scales in the direction of the gradient. Based on the output of such a bank of gradient filters, a procedure is proposed to select automatically a suitable scale, and with that, the size of the right convolution kernel. The application of poorly adapted filters, which make the exact localization of gray-value corners or T-, X-, and Y-junctions more difficult, is thus avoided. Possible gaps at such junctions are discussed for images of real scenes, and possibilities for the closure of some of these gaps are demonstrated when the extrema of the magnitudes of the gray-value gradients are used. >"

A fundamental problem in computing such descriptions is scale: a derivative must be taken over some neighborhood, but there is seldom a principled basis for choosing its size. Scale-space filtering is a method that describes signals qualitatively, managing the ambiguity of scale in an organized and natural way. The signal is first expanded by convolution with gaussian masks over a continuum of sizes. This \"scale-space\" image is then collapsed, using its qualitative structure, into a tree providing a concise but complete qualitative description covering all scales of observation. The description is further refined by applying a stability criterion, to identify events that persist of large changes in scale."

Theories have been developed to explain the discrimina-bility of such textures in terms of specific features within the micropatterns themselves. For example, Beck1,2 observed that a region filled with vertical Ts is readily distinguished from one filled with tilted Ts but not from one filled with vertical Ls. He attributed this to the different distribution of oriented line segments present in the former case but not in the latter. However, Bergen and Julesz3 found that a region of randomly oriented Xs segregated from one filled with randomly oriented Ls, in spite of the identical distribution of oriented line segments in the two cases. They suggested that this discrimination might be based on the density of such features as terminators, corners, and intersections within the patterns. We note here that simpler, lower-level mechanisms tuned for size may be sufficient to explain this discrimination. We tested this by varying the relative sizes of the Xs and the Ls; when they produce equal responses in size-tuned mechanisms they are hard to discriminate, and when they produce different size-tuned responses they are easy to discriminate."

This paper introduces a new tool for dealing with this problem. A heuristic principle is proposed stating that local extrema over scales of diierent combinations of normalized scale invariant derivatives are likely candidates to correspond to interesting structures. Support is given by theoretical considerations and experiments on real and synthetic data. The resulting methodology lends itself naturally to two-stage algorithms; feature detection at coarse scales followed by feature localization at ner scales. Experiments on blob detection, junction detection and edge detection demonstrate that the proposed method gives intuitively reasonable results."

                "text": "An introduction is given to a theory of early visual information processing. The theory has been implemented, and examples are given of images at various stages of analysis. It is argued that the first step of consequence is to compute a primitive but rich description of the grey-level changes present in an image. The description is expressed in a vocabulary of kinds of intensity change (EDGE, SHADING-EDGE, EXTENDED-EDGE, LINE, BLOB etc.). Modifying parameters are bound to the elements in the description, specifying their POSITION, ORIENTATION, TERMINATION points, CONTRAST, SIZE and FUZZINESS. This description is obtained from the intensity array by fixed techniques, and it is called the primal sketch. For most images, the primal sketch is large and unwieldy. The second important step in visual information processing is to group its contents in a way that is appropriate for later recognition. From our ability to interpret drawings with little semantic content, one may infer the presence in our perceptual equipment of symbolic processes that can define \"place-tokens\" in an image in various ways, and can group them according to certain rules. Homomorphic techniques fail to account for many of these grouping phenomena, whose explanations require mechanisms of construction rather than mechanisms of detection. The necessary grouping of elements in the primal sketch may be achieved by a mechanism that has available the processes inferred from above, together with the ability to select items by first order discriminations acting on the elements' parameters. Only occasionally do these mechanisms use downward-flowing information about the contents of the particular image being processed. It is argued that \"non-attentive\" vision is in practice implemented by these grouping operations and first order discriminations acting on the primal sketch. The class of computations so obtained differs slightly from the class of second order operations on the intensity array. The extraction of a form from the primal sketch using these techniques amounts to the separation of figure from ground. It is concluded that most of the separation can be carried out by using techniques that do not depend upon the particular image in question. Therefore, figure-ground separation can normally precede the description of the shape of the extracted form. Up to this point, higher-level knowledge and purpose are brought to bear on only a few of the decisions taken during the processing. This relegates the widespread use of downward-flowing information to a later stage than is found in current machine-vision programs, and implies that such knowledge should influence the control of, rather than interfering with, the actual data-processing that is taking place lower down."

The method also enables the user to measure degree of diffuseness, height of edges, and bar edge width. The Gaussian difference signatures and apparent width signatures used are defined. To sift out the major edges, subsets of edge pixels must be selected. For describing the local gray level, landscape averaging needs to be done in a noncommittal fashion, as opposed to fitting a specific function blindly to data. Edge focusing, which is a coarse-to-fine traversal of brightness changes, deals with the subsets, whereas signatures may be thought of as a kind of reasonably cleverly done averaging. This method is of importance for distinguishing between illumination phenomena and object edges, performing depth-from-focus in single images, and in junction analysis.<<ETX>>"

                "text": "This thesis, within the subfield of computer science known as computer vision, deals with the use of scale-space analysis in early low-level processing of visual information. The main contributions comprise the following five subjects: The formulation of a scale-space theory for discrete signals. Previously, the scale-space concept has been expressed for continuous signals only. We propose that the canonical way to construct a scale-space for discrete signals is by convolution with a kernel called the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel, or equivalently by solving a semi-discretized version of the diffusion equation. Both the one-dimensional and two-dimensional cases are covered. An extensive analysis of discrete smoothing kernels is carried out for one-dimensional signals and the discrete scale-space properties of the most common discretizations to the continuous theory are analysed. A representation, called the scale-space primal sketch, which gives a formal description of the hierarchical relations between structures at different levels of scale. It is aimed at making information in the scale-space representation explicit. We give a theory for its construction and an algorithm for computing it. A theory for extracting significant image structures and determining the scales of these structures from this representation in a solely bottom-up data-driven way. Examples demonstrating how such qualitative information extracted from the scale-space primal sketch can be used for guiding and simplifying other early visual processes. Applications are given to edge detection, histogram analysis and classification based on local features. Among other possible applications one can mention perceptual grouping, texture analysis, stereo matching, model matching and motion. A detailed theoretical analysis of the evolution properties of critical points and blobs in scale-space, comprising drift velocity estimates under scale-space smoothing, a classification of the possible types of generic events at bifurcation situations and estimates of how the number of local extrema in a signal can be expected to decrease as function of the scale parameter. For two-dimensional signals the generic bifurcation events are annihilations and creations of extremum-saddle point pairs. Interpreted in terms of blobs, these transitions correspond to annihilations, merges, splits and creations. Experiments on different types of real imagery demonstrate that the proposed theory gives perceptually intuitive results."

A genuinely discrete scale-space theory is developed and its connection to the continuous scale-space theory is explained. Special attention is given to discretization effects, which occur when results from the continuous scale-space theory are to be implemented computationally. The 1D problem is solved completely in an axiomatic manner. For the 2D problem, the author discusses how the 2D discrete scale space should be constructed. The main results are as follows: the proper way to apply the scale-space theory to discrete signals and discrete images is by discretization of the diffusion equation, not the convolution integral; the discrete scale space obtained in this way can be described by convolution with the kernel, which is the discrete analog of the Gaussian kernel, a scale-space implementation based on the sampled Gaussian kernel might lead to undesirable effects and computational problems, especially at fine levels of scale; the 1D discrete smoothing transformations can be characterized exactly and a complete catalogue is given; all finite support 1D discrete smoothing transformations arise from repeated averaging over two adjacent elements (the limit case of such an averaging process is described); and the symmetric 1D discrete smoothing kernels are nonnegative and unimodal, in both the spatial and the frequency domain. >"

Major theories due to Julesz and Beck attribute preattentive texture segmentation to differences in first-order statistics of stimulus features such as orientation, size and brightness of constituent elements. An alternative approach seeks to exploit psychophysically observed spatial frequency channels and neurophysiologirally observed blob, bar- and edge-sensitive mechanisms, and perform simple computations oil the outputs of these to find texture boundaries. Previous models in this framework have been incompletely specified; our model is precisely stated and applicable to arbitrary grey scale textures. We claim that the responses of two types of mechanisms are necessary and sufficient: (a) center-surronud mechanisms of various widths. and (b) oriented tnechanisius of various widths and ori- entations which are even-symmetric about their axes.
