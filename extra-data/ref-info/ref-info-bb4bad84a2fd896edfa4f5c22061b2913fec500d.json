A synaptic evolution scheme of a new kind is proposed in which incoming patterns rather than converging afferents compete. The change in the efficacy of a given synapse depends not only on instantaneous pre- and postsynaptic activities but also on a slowly varying time-averaged value of the postsynaptic activity. Assuming an appropriate nonlinear form for this dependence, development of selectivity is obtained under quite general conditions on the sensory environment. One does not require nonlinearity of the neuron's integrative power nor does one need to assume any particular form for intracortical circuitry. This is first illustrated in simple cases, e.g., when the environment consists of only two different stimuli presented alternately in a random manner. The following formal statement then holds: the state of the system converges with probability 1 to points of maximum selectivity in the state space. We next consider the problem of early development of orientation selectivity and binocular interaction in primary visual cortex. Giving the environment an appropriate form, we obtain orientation tuning curves and ocular dominance comparable to what is observed in normally reared adult cats or monkeys. Simulations with binocular input and various types of normal or altered environments show good agreement with the relevant experimental data. Experiments are suggested that could test our theory further."

According to the model context aids the perception of target letters as they are processed in the perceptual system. The implication that the duration and timing of the context in which a letter occurs should greatly influence the perceptibility of the target is confirmed by a series of experiments demonstrating that early or enhanced presentations of word and pronounceablepseudoword contexts greatly increase the perceptibility of target letters. Also according to the model, letters in strings that share several letters with words should be equally perceptible whether they are orthographically regular and pronounceable (SLET) or irregular (SLNT) and should be much more perceptible than letters in contexts that share few letters with any word (XLQJ). This prediction is tested and confirmed. The basic results of all the experiments are accounted for, with some modification of parameters, although there are some discrepancies in detail. Several recent findings that seem to challenge the model are considered and a number of extensions are proposed."

Note further, that those correlations between the first and second positions are in opposition to the \u201cnatural\u201d similarity of the letters in the first serial position. In this experiment, we first trained the system on the four stimuli already described. Since the second serial position had only two letters in it, the size two cluster became a position-specific letter detector for the second serial position. One unit responded to the A and one to the B in the second position. Notice that the units are also responding to the letters in the first serial position as well. One unit is responding to an A or a B in the first position while the other responds to an E or an S. Figure 12 shows the patterns of weights developed by the two units. After training, the system was then presented patterns containing only the first letter of the pair and, as expected, the system had learned the \u201cunnatural\u201d classification of the letters in the first position. Here the strong correlation between the first and second position led the competitive learning mechanism to override the strong correlation between the highly similar stimulus patterns in the first serial position. This suggests that even though the competitive learning system is an \u201cunsupervised\u201d learning mechanism, one can control what it learns by controlling the statistical structure of the stimulus patterns being presented to it. In this sense, we can think of the right-hand letter in this experiment as being a kind of reaching stimulus aimed at determining the classification learned for other aspects of the stimulus. It should also be noted that this teaching mechanism is essentially the same as the so-called error-less learning procedure used by Terrace (1963) in training pigeons to peck a certain color key by associating that color with a response situation where their pecking is determined by other factors."

Although Minsky was perhaps the first on the scene with a learning machine, the real beginnings of meaningful neuron-like network learning can probably be traced to the work of Frank Rosenblatt, a Bronx High School of Science classmate of Minsky\u2019s. Rosenblatt invented a class of simple neuron-like learning networks which he called perceptrons. In his book, Principles of Neurodynamics (1962), Rosenblatt brought together all of his results on perceptrons."
