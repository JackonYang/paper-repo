Despite the successes of these systems, accuracy will always be imperfect. For many reasons, it is highly desirable to accurately estimate the confidence the system has in the correctness of each extracted field. The information extraction system we evaluate is based on a linear-chain conditional random field (CRF), a probabilistic model which has performed well on information extraction tasks because of its ability to capture arbitrary, overlapping features of the input in a Markov model. We implement several techniques to estimate the confidence of both extracted fields and entire multi-field records, obtaining an average precision of 98% for retrieving correct fields and 87% for multi-field records."

We present a multilevel bootstrapping algorithm that generates both the semantic lexicon and extraction patterns simultaneously. As input, our technique requires only unannotated training texts and a handful of seed words for a category. We use a mutual bootstrapping technique to alternately select the best extraction pattern for the category and bootstrap its extractions into the semantic lexicon, which is the basis for selecting the next extraction pattern. To make this approach more robust, we add a second level of bootstrapping (metabootstrapping) that retains only the most reliable lexicon entries produced by mutual bootstrapping and then restarts the process. We evaluated this multilevel bootstrapping technique on a collection of corporate web pages and a corpus of terrorism news articles. The algorithm produced high-quality dictionaries for several semantic categories."

This data is best exploited infavailable as arelational table that we could use for answering precise queries or running data mining tasks.We explore a technique for extracting such tables from document collections that requires only a handful of training examples from users. These examples are used to generate extraction patterns, that in turn result in new tuples being extracted from the document collection.We build on this idea and present our Snowball system. Snowball introduces novel strategies for generating patterns and extracting tuples from plain-text documents.At each iteration of the extraction process, Snowball evaluates the quality of these patterns and tuples without human intervention,and keeps only the most reliable ones for the next iteration. In this paper we also develop a scalable evaluation methodology and metrics for our task, and present a thorough experimental evaluation of Snowball and comparable techniques over a collection of more than 300,000 newspaper documents."

The algorithm, called PMI-IR, uses Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) and Information Retrieval (IR) to measure the similarity of pairs of words. PMI-IR is empirically evaluated using 80 synonym test questions from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and 50 synonym test questions from a collection of tests for students of English as a Second Language (ESL). On both tests, the algorithm obtains a score of 74%. PMI-IR is contrasted with Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), which achieves a score of 64% on the same 80 TOEFL questions. The paper discusses potential applications of the new unsupervised learning algorithm and some implications of the results for LSA and LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing)."

In deciding which putative entities and relations should be extracted, a key problem is how to combine evidence across the multiple occurrences of these entities and relations. We present a novel statistical approach to address this issue, and evaluate it in the context of extracting protein names and protein-protein interactions from MEDLINE abstracts. We experimentally compare our method against a number of intuitive and simpler baselines. Our experimental results suggest that the issue of combining evidence is indeed important in these tasks. Furthermore, we show that our proposed method outperforms the baselines considered in a variety of settings."

Examples of such problems range from multitarget tracking to extracting information from text documents. However, most probabilistic modeling formalisms \u2014 even firstorder ones \u2014 assume a fixed, known set of objects. We introduce a language called Blog for specifying probability distributions over relational structures that include varying sets of objects. In this paper we present Blog informally, by means of example models for multi-target tracking and citation matching. We discuss some attractive features of Blog models and some avenues of future work."

A common approach is to divide the number of cases observed in a sample by the size of the sample; sometimes small positive quantities are added to divisor and dividend in order to avoid zero estimates for types missing from the sample. These approaches are obvious and simple, but they lack principled justification, and yield estimates that can be wildly inaccurate. I.J. Good and Alan Turing developed a family of theoretically well-founded techniques appropriate to this domain. Some versions of the Good\u2013Turing approach are very demanding computationally, but we define a version, the Simple Good\u2013Turing estimator, which is straightforward to use. Tested on a variety of natural-language-related data sets, the Simple Good\u2013Turing estimator performs well, absolutely and relative both to the approaches just discussed and to other, more sophisticated techniques."

Experiments carried out on the TREC-2001 judged-answer collection show that the approach achieves a high level of performance (i.e. 81% success rate).
