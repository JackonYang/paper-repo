The typical minimum distance of these codes increases linearly with block length for a fixed rate and fixed j . When used with maximum likelihood decoding on a sufficiently quiet binary-input symmetric channel, the typical probability of decoding error decreases exponentially with block length for a fixed rate and fixed j . A simple but nonoptimum decoding scheme operating directly from the channel a posteriori probabilities is described. Both the equipment complexity and the data-handling capacity in bits per second of this decoder increase approximately linearly with block length. For j > 3 and a sufficiently low rate, the probability of error using this decoder on a binary symmetric channel is shown to decrease at least exponentially with a root of the block length. Some experimental results show that the actual probability of decoding error is much smaller than this theoretical bound."

Fifty years of efforts and invention have finally produced coding schemes that closely approach Shannon's channel capacity limit on AWGN channels, both power-limited and band-limited. Similar gains are being achieved in other important applications, such as wireless channels. This course is divided in two parts. In the first part, we remind students of the basics of the theory of linear codes for conventional memoryless ergodic channels. We then introduce more advanced notions so as to make comprehensible some of the most recent coding schemes proposed in the literature. In the second part, we expound the principles of coded modulations for the Gaussian channel and, if time permits, for Rician and Rayleigh fading channels (fully interleaved). We will conclude the course by evoking some aspects of code design for non-ergodic block-fading channels.

Several alternative expressions of a given symbol, to be referred to as its replicas, can therefore be computed in terms of other ones. Decoding is interpreted as decoding upon a received symbol, given itself and a number of such replicas, expressed in terms of other received symbols. For linear q-ary (n,k) block codes, soft-decision demodulation and memoryless channels, the maximum-likelihood decision rule on a given symbol is formulated in terms of r \\leqn - k linearly independent replicas from the parity-check equations. All replicas deriving from the r selected replicas by linear combination are actually taken into account in this decision rule. Its implementation can be direct; use transformations or a sequential circuit implementing a trellis representation of the parity-check matrix. If r = n - k , decoding is optimum, in the sense of symbol-by-symbol maximum-likelihoed. Simplification results in the transformed and sequential implementations when r . If the selected replicas are disjoint, generalized ( q -ary, weighted) threshold decoding results. The decoding process can easily be modffied in order to provide word-by-word maximum-likelihood decoding. Convolutional codes are briefly considered. Two specific problems are discussed: the use of previous decisions, which leads to a weighted generalization of feedback decoding, and the extension of replication decoding to nonsystematic codes."

Another is the Berlekamp algorithm for factoring polynomials over finite fields, whose later extensions and embellishments became widely used in symbolic manipulation systems. Other novel algorithms improved the basic methods for doing various arithmetic operations in finite fields of characteristic two. Other major research contributions in this book included a new class of Lee metric codes, and precise asymptotic results on the number of information symbols in long binary BCH codes.Selected chapters of the book became a standard graduate textbook.Both practicing engineers and scholars will find this book to be of great value."
