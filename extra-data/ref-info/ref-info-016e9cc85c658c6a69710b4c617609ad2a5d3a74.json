Unlike AI question-answering systems that focus on the generation of new answers, FAQ Finder retrieves existing ones found in frequently-asked question files. Unlike information retrieval approaches that rely on a purely lexical metric of similarity between query and document, FAQ Finder uses a semantic knowledge base (WordNet) to improve its ability to match question and answer. We describe the design and the current implementation of the system and its support components, including results from an evaluation of the system''s performance against a corpus of user questions. An important finding was that a combination of semantic and statistical techniques works better than any single approach. We analyze failures of the system and discuss future research aimed at addressing them."

The methods are illustrated in a broad domain: answering general-knowledge questions using an on-line encyclopedia.\nA closed-class question is a question stated in natural language, which assumes some definite answer typified by a noun phrase rather than a procedural answer. The methods hypothesize noun phrases that are likely to be the answer, and present the user with relevant text in which they are marked, focussing the user's attention appropriately. Furthermore, the sentences of matching text that are shown to the user are selected to confirm phrase relations implied by the question, rather than being selected solely on the basis of word frequency.\nThe corpus is accessed via an information retrieval (IR) system that supports boolean search with proximity constraints. Queries are automatically constructed from the phrasal content of the question, and passed to the IR system to find relevant text. Then the relevant text is itself analyzed; noun phrase hypotheses are extracted and new queries are independently made to confirm phrase relations for the various hypotheses.\nThe methods are currently being implemented in a system called MURAX and although this process is not complete, it is sufficiently advanced for an interim evaluation to be presented."

After parsing each sentence in these documents, databases are constructed by extracting relational triples from the parse output. The triples consist of discourse entities, semantic relations, and the governing words to which the entities are bound in the sentence. Database triples are also generated for the questions. Question-answering consists of matching the question database records with the records for the documents. The prototype system was developed specifically to respond to the TREC-8 Q&A track, with an existing parser and some existing capability for analyzing parse output. The system was designed to investigate the viability of using structural information about the sentences in a document to answer questions. The CL Research system achieved an overall score of 0.281 (i.e., on average, providing a sentence containing a correct answer as the fourth selection). The score demonstrates the viability of the approach. Post-hoc analysis suggests that this score understates the performance of the prototype and estimates that a more accurate score is approximately 0.482. This analysis also suggests several further improvements and the potential for investigating other avenues that make use of semantic networks and computational lexicology."

The essence of the approach can be stated simply: index the answers. This is done by establishing about 20 classes of objects that can be identified in text by shallow parsing, and by annotating and indexing the text with these labels, which we call QA-Tokens. Given a question, its class is identified and the question is modified accordingly to include the appropriate token(s). The search engine is modified to rank and return short passages of text rather than documents. The QA-Tokens are used in later stages of analysis to extract the supposed answers from these returned passages. Finally, all potential answers are ranked using a novel formula, which determines which ones among them are most likely to be correct."

As a rst evaluation, it is important to examine the evaluation methodology itself to understand any limits on the conclusions that can be drawn from the evaluation and possibly to nd ways to improve subsequent evaluations. This paper has two main goals: to describe in detail how the evaluation was implemented, and to examine the consequences of the methodology on the comparative performance of the systems participating in the evaluation. The examination uncovered no serious aws in the methodology, supporting its continued use for question answering evaluation. Nonetheless, redeening the speciic task to be performed so that it more closely matches an actual user task does appear warranted."

Available on the World Wide Web since December 1993, the START Server provides users with access to multi-media information in response to questions formulated in English. Over the last 3 years, the START Server answered hundreds of thousands of questions from users all over the world. The START Server is built on two foundations: the sentence-level Natural Language processing capability provided by the START Natural Language system (Katz [1990])and the idea of natural language annotations for multi-media information segments. This paper starts with an overview of sentence-level processing in the START system and then explains how annotating information segments with collections of English sentences makes it possible to use the power of sentence-level natural language processing in the service of multi-media information access. The paper ends with a proposal to annotate the World Wide Web."

Our study shows: (1) IE can provide solid support for QA; (2) low-level IE like Named Entity tagging is often a necessary component in handling most types of questions; (3) a robust natural language shallow parser provides a structural basis for handling questions; (4) high-level domain independent IE, i.e. extraction of multiple relationships and general events, is expected to bring about a breakthrough in QA."

Experiments performed on small collections with single-domain thesauri suggest that expanding query vectors with words that are lexically related to the original query words can ameliorate some of the problems of mismatched vocabularies. This paper examines the utility of lexical query expansion in the large, diverse TREC collection. Concepts are represented by WordNet synonym sets and are expanded by following the typed links included in WordNet. Experimental results show this query expansion technique makes little difference in retrieval effectiveness if the original queries are relatively complete descriptions of the information being sought even when the concepts to be expanded are selected by hand. Less well developed queries can be significantly improved by expansion of hand-chosen concepts. However, an automatic procedure that can approximate the set of hand picked synonym sets has yet to be devised, and expanding by the synonym sets that are automatically generated can degrade retrieval performance."

As with document relevance judging, assessors had legitimate differences of opinions as to whether a response actually answers a question, but comparative evaluation of QA systems was stable despite these differences.

We continue our work in TREC 3, performing runs in the routing, ad-hoc, and foreign language environments. Our major focus is massive query expansion : adding from 300 to 530 terms to each query. These terms come from known relevant documents in the case of routing, and from just the top retrieved documents in the case of ad-hoc and Spanish. This approach improves effectiveness from 7% to 25% in the various experiments. Other ad-hoc work extends our investigations into combining global similarities, giving an overall indication of how a document matches a query, with local similarities identifying a smaller part of the document which matches the query. Using an overlapping text window definition of local, we achieve a 16% improvement."

                "text": "In this paper we present a robust parsing algorithm based on the link grammar formalism for parsing natural languages. Our algorithm is a natural extension of the original dynamic programming recognition algorithm which recursively counts the number of linkages between two words in the input sentence. The modified algorithm uses the notion of a null link in order to allow a connection between any pair of adjacent words, regardless of their dictionary definitions. The algorithm proceeds by making three dynamic programming passes. In the first pass, the input is parsed using the original algorithm which enforces the constraints on links to ensure grammaticality. In the second pass, the total cost of each substring of words is computed, where cost is determined by the number of null links necessary to parse the substring. The final pass counts the total number of parses with minimal cost. All of the original pruning techniques have natural counterparts in the robust algorithm. When used together with memoization, these techniques enable the algorithm to run efficiently with cubic worst-case complexity. We have implemented these ideas and tested them by parsing the Switchboard corpus of conversational English. This corpus is comprised of approximately three million words of text, corresponding to more than 150 hours of transcribed speech collected from telephone conversations restricted to 70 different topics. Although only a small fraction of the sentences in this corpus are \u201cgrammatical\u201d by standard criteria, the robust link grammar parser is able to extract relevant structure for a large portion of the sentences. We present the results of our experiments using this system, including the analyses of selected and random sentences from the corpus. We placed a version of the robust parser on the Word Wide Web for experimentation. It can be reached at URL http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/es.emu.edu/project/link/www/robust.html. In this version there are some limitations such as the maximum length of a sentence in words and the maximum amount of memory the parser can use."

We develop a set of algorithmic tools for extracting information from the link structures of such environments, and report on experiments that demonstrate their eectiveness in a variety of contexts on the World Wide Web. The central issue we address within our framework is the distillation of broad search topics, through the discovery of \\authoritative\" information sources on such topics. We propose and test an algorithmic formulation of the notion of authority, based on the relationship between a set of relevant authoritative pages and the set of \\hub pages\" that join them together in the link structure. Our formulation has connections to the eigenvectors of certain matrices associated with the link graph; these connections in turn motivate additional heuristics for link-based analysis."

The simplicity of the approach means the model trains on 40,000 sentences in under 15 minutes.

                "text": "This package is a faithful implementation of Koskenniemi's two-level morphology, KIMMO (Koskenniemi 1983). As with previous tools from the Summer Institute of Linguistics (e.g., Weber, Black, and McConnel 1988), the package is primarily aimed at field linguists with little computational expertise, but for whom morphological analysis tools are useful. The book that accompanies the software is extremely good: among other things, it incorporates what is in my opinion the best available introduction to the theory and practice of two-level morphology. The package is therefore not only useful to the audience for which it is primarily intended: it will also be of use to those wishing to learn something about computational morphology, and would be an excellent teaching aid for a computational linguistics course. The book is divided into seven chapters and three appendices. Chapter 1 traces the history of computational morphology. As is typical of such overviews, the scope is somewhat narrow, discussing only a few Finnish projects (besides the work of Koskenniemi and his apostles), and work done at the Summer Institute of Linguistics. That criticism aside, the rest of the chapter is an accurate overview of the positive and negative aspects of KIMMO. On the negative side, Antworth cites the well-known fact that KIMMO cannot elegantly handle nonconcatenative morphology such as infixation or reduplication. He also notes limitations more particular to the PC-KIMMO implementation, such as the lack of a rule compiler and the lack of a sensible (i.e., non-finite-state) model of morphotactics; both of these issues have received treatment within the two-level school (Dalrymple et al. 1987, Bear 1986, inter alia), though with respect to rule compilation, Antworth is justified in noting (p. 11) that \"it remains to be seen if such a project is feasible for small computers.\" Chapter 2 is an introduction to PC-KIMMO, and gives a sample session of its use. Chapters 3 through 5 describe in detail how finite state transducers (FSTs) work,"
