The system is comprised of an optical scanner reader (OSR) which digitizes data with a maximum vertical resolution of 48 lines, and a software measurement-decision system. The OSR operates at 10 characters/second in conjunction with an XDS 930 computer, and produces digitized characters on magnetic tape. Recognition is done at rates of 3.5 to 6 characters/second off-line via the measurement-decision system operating on a CDC 6400/6600 computer system. The measurement system generates a directed graph representation of each character and extracts a primary feature vector. This vector consists of cavity (both open and closed) and spur information. Other specialized measurements are made later in the recognition process under the control of a deterministic decision tree. (Author)"

Many of the steps currently involve tedious manual operations. Handwritten character recognition (CR) techniques are being developed as a part of efforts to automate procedures. To be useful in such applications, strict accuracy constraints must be observed. Substitutions (misrecognitions) are particularly harmful. Rejections (inability to recognize) are less serious, although as high a recognition rate as possible within the constraints is desirable. A complete practical CR system involves more than just the recognition algorithm. Increased performance may be obtained effectively by improving preprocessing or changing a feature calculation, as well as by modifying the recognition logic. The CR system under development was discussed in \"Recognition of Handprinted Characters for Automated Cartography\" at this conference last year. Current performance will be reviewed and the planned approach to improve it will be presented."

The form of characters is constrained by requiring each character to be handprinted on a standard grid. The grid is composed of twenty line segments, each of which forms the basis for a feature, yielding twenty features to represent each character. A person printing these characters is not expected to remain precisely on the grid lines. The errors that do occur in following the grid lines are assumed to be normally distributed; therefore, each feature is based on a \"longitudinal Gaussian-shaped surface.\" A page of constrained characters to be recognized is input to the computer using a television camera. Each character on the page is located, isolated from the other characters, and quantized into binary points. A novel technique utilizing a Gaussian point-to-line distance concept for calculation of \"feature value\" has been employed. The recognition program extracts the twenty feature values and attempts to determine in which of the forty-nine character classes the unknown character belongs. This decision is made based on these twenty features using a weighted minimum distance classifier. If only a marginal classification can be made, a second-level decision is used to increase the likelihood of correct classification. The second-level decision uses the most discriminating features of the two most likely character classes in order to increase the likelihood of correct classification. All character-dependent data are obtained through training techniques."

The objective is to reduce the soundings and coordinates from the smooth sheets to digital tape for editing and preparation of standard oceanographic charts. In the system described the smooth sheet soundings are \"read\" by a video camera and recognized by software. Commercially available OCR systems are not suited to this task because the text is unconstrained in both font and format. In order to allow for differences in handwriting styles, the recognition software must work with those features that distinguish one character from another, while tolerating variation in the formation of a single character. For production purposes, a high through-put rate is needed. A practical recognition algorithm embodying these concepts will be described, along with the preprocessing steps found necessary. The performance of the system will be discussed, with examples."

The technique employed may be characterised as a feature-detection method which utilises a decision tree to reduce the data to a decodable form. The data, consisting of lines and enclosures, are classified into labelled categories by a process which results in the formation of a one-dimensional symbol string. This string is then reduced to a decodable form by sets of context-dependent transformations. Data obtained by computer simulation are presented, indicating the ability of the method to recognise machine- and handprinted numerals."

Recognition of handwritten arabic numerals requires sufficient system flexibility to cope with both unlimited variations in character shape and a large number of writing instruments. This flexibility has been achieved by combining the use of a stored recognition table and a hardware microprogram. The recognition logic obtained by computer simulation is immediately stored in the core memory as a table. The numerals are recognized by extracting a sequence of the geometrical features in horizontal zones of the character after normalization of the height of the character and the width of the strokes. The use of sequential recognition logic helps reduce the capacity of core memory required to obtain the desired high rate of recognition. The correct recognition rate of a single digit for a large sample of letters averaged 95 percent. For a three-digit sorting with 13 stackers the sorter incorrectly recognized approximately 0.1 percent, a rate of error consistent with manual sorting."

Whereas in the case of character recognition the number of pattern classes considered different usually does not exceed one hundred, the number of pattern classes with which one finds himself confronted here is only limited by the vocabulary of the language. Furthermore, the problem is reasonably well-defined, i.e., in most cases the correct categorization choice is known by comparison with human performance. In some cases such performance by different people may not result in complete agreement, but even then the number of alternative results is restricted to a small number. Experimental data are readily available and their variability, insofar as they depend on subject and context, can be easily controlled."

In the character reader the input patterns are generally composed of the template characters and their distorted ones. Using the template patterns, a nonparametric procedure is developed for determining linear discriminant functions. Furthermore, we propose the mechanism which has the ability to recognize even a misprinted character by using the information of the preceding character. The algorithms offer the following advantages: flexibility (cost assignments), simplicity, adaptation, and acceptable performance. Performance of the machines is analyzed and convergence proofs of the learning procedures in the machines are derived. We also present some results of computer experiments."

In essence, this method involves maximizing the cross-correlation value between the unknown character and a set of average characters, there being one average character for each allowed character class. An average character is represented by a two-dimensional function. The value of this function at a point is the probability of occurrence of a mark at that point for the character class represented by the average character. Negative weights are given to areas of low probability in each average character to improve discriminability. The simulation results indicate that this method is applicable to the recognition of machine printing, and perhaps to the recognition of constrained hand printing. The method can be implemented in an economical manner using electro-optical techniques."

                "text": "The recognition of hand-printed numerals is studied on a broad experimental basis within the constraints imposed by a raster scanner generating binary video patterns, a mixed measurement set, and a statistical decision function. A computer-controlled scanner is used to acquire the characters, to adjust the raster resolution and registration, and to monitor the black-white threshold of the quantizer. The dimensionality of the decision problem is reduced by a hybrid system of measurements. In the measurement design, three types of measurements are generated: a set of \"topological\" measurements, a set of logical \"n-tuples,\" both designed by hand, and a large set of n-tuples machine generated at random under special constraints. The final set of 100 measurements is selected automatically by a programmed algorithm that attempts to minimize the maximum expected error rate between every character pair. Computer simulation experiments show the effectiveness of the selection procedure, the contribution of the different types of measurements, the effect of the number of measurements selected on recognition, and the desirability of size and shear normalization. The final system is tested on four data sets printed under different degrees of control on the writers. Each data set consists of approximately 10 000 characters. For this comparison, a first-order maximum likelihood function with weights quantized to 100 levels is used. Error versus reject curves are given on several combinations of training and test sets."

By properly specifying a set of easily detectable topological features, it is possible to convert automatically the handwritten characters into stylized forms and to classify them into primary classes with similar topological configurations. Final recognition is accomplished by a secondary stage that performs local analysis on the characters in each primary category. The recognition system consists of two stages: global recognition, followed by local recognition. Automatic character stylization results in pattern clustering which simplifies the classification tasks considerably, while allowing a high degree of generality in the acceptable writing format. Simulation of this scheme on a digital computer has shown only 6 percent misrecognition."

The recognition logic required 11.3 man-hours to design and recognized over 99.9 percent of its test characters. It is also small and can run at high speeds on standard digital computer systems. The results of several experiments and recommendations for future experiments to extend these results to hand-printed characters are also included.

The transformation can be implemented electronically by programming a flying-spot raster-scanner to scan at specified angles rather than only along specified axes. Alternatively, curve-follower normalization can be achieved by transforming the coordinate waveforms in a linear combining network. Second-order moments of the pattern are convenient properties to use in specifying the transformation. By mapping the original pattern into one having a scalar moment matrix all linear pattern variations can be removed. Comparison experiments with three sets of handprinted numerals showed that error rates were reduced by integral factors if the patterns were normalized before scanning for recognition."

The development of decision criteria is traced from the normal multivariate probability function to the Hamming distance, and the relative efficiencies compared. Decision boundaries are investigated by a stepwise transformation from character to character. Computer simulation of one-step recognition processes using these discriminants yields recognition rates which vary from low values using the simplest criterion, up to 100% in some cases using the most complicated criterion. Combinations of these methods into two-step processes are compared, and an attempt is made to find an optimum strategy for the case of poor quality hand-drawn capital letters."

Each of these simulated machines has read documents containing rows of handwritten Arabic numbers. Sample numbers were produced by at least 20 people for each simulation study. The three machines simulated differ in the control required of the writer during document preparation and in the complexity of the machines. Writing controls were required for the preparation of the first two types of documents. A section of this paper concerns experiments with and a mathematical model of controlled writing. The third simulated machine was applied both to numbers written within preprinted boxes and to numbers written without any guide marks. About one per cent of 2180 of these numbers were misread as the wrong character. This error rate is based on a sequential experiment in which the recognition logic is constructed from all characters not recognized and thus rejected prior to each input character. Numbers, when rejected, cause the programn to identify them from a table. Their structure is then entered into the recognition logic. The rejection rate decreased throughout the experiment. The last rejection rate was about 10 per cent."

Often it will be undesirable to require the user to learn to type, and this mode can be cumbersome for random two-dimensional entry on a form or drawing. Using an electronic tablet coupled to a display tube would make it convenient for the user to point to a correct answer or print it in a very natural way. This paper describes a new technique for converting these hand written symbols to code words which can subsequently be processed by a computer."

The second problem, \"pattern recognition,\" consists of identifying a given figure which is known to belong to one of a finite set of classes. This is the problem encountered when reading alphanumeric characters. Both recognition and detection have been successfully carried out on an IBM 704 computer which was programmed to simulate a spatial computer (a stored-program machine comprised of a master control unit directing a network of logical modules). One of the programs tested consisted of a recognition process for reading hand-lettered sans-serif alphanumeric characters. This process permits large variations in the size, shape, and proportions of the input figures and can tolerate random noise when it is well scattered in small specks. Programs for detecting L-shaped (or A-shaped) figures in the presence of other randomly drawn patterns have also been successfully tested."

The rule of operation of the categorizer is called the ``recognition function.'' The optimization of the recognition function is discussed, and the form of the optimal function is derived. In practice, a prohibitively large sample is required to provide a basis for estimating the optimal recognition function. If, however, certain assumptions about the probability distributions of the measurements are warranted, recognition functions that are asymptotically optimal may be obtained readily. A small numerical example, involving the recognition of the hand-printed characters A, B, and C is solved by means of the techiques described. The recognition accuracy is found to be 95 per cent."

A binary matrix representation of signal is used in this paper. A nearest-neighbor dependence method is obtained by going beyond the usual assumption of statistical independence. The recognition network consists of three levels?a layer of AND gates, a set of linear summing networks in parallel, and a maximum selection circuit. Formulas for weights or recognition parameters are also derived, as logarithms of ratios of conditional probabilities. These formulas lead to a straightforward procedure of estimating weights from sample characters, which are then used in subsequent recognition. Simulation of the recognition method is performed on a digital computer. The program consists of two main operations-estimation of parameters from sample characters, and recognition using these estimated values. The experimental results indicate that the effect of neighbor dependence upon recognition performance is significant. On the basis of a rather small sample of 50 sets of hand-printed alphanumeric characters, the recognition performance of the nearest-neighbor method compares favorably with other recognition schemes."

This paper describes a parser whose input is a piecewise linear encoding of a contour and whose output is a string of high-level descriptions: arcs, corners, protrusions, intrusions, etc. Such a representation can be used not only for description but also for recognition. Previous syntactic techniques for contour description have often used high-level languages for the description of contours. This has been necessary in order to guarantee contour closure and eliminate the noise. In the present approach the numerical preprocessing of the contour removes most of the noise and also produces the answers to certain simple questions about its shape. Therefore, simpler grammars can be used for the contour description. Examples of descriptions of contours are given for handwritten numerals, white blood cells, and printed wiring circuit boards."

The theory of how test results should be combined to yield an optimal assignment has been discussed in an earlier paper. Here, attention is focused on the tests themselves. At present, we usually measure the effectiveness of a set of tests empirically, i.e., by determining the percentage of correct recognitions made by some recognition device which uses these tests. In this paper, we discuss some of the theoretical problems encountered in trying to determine a more formal measure of the effectiveness of a set of tests; a measure which might be a practical substitute for the empirical evaluation. Specifically, the following question is considered: What constitutes an effective set of tests, and how is this effectiveness dependent on the correlations among, and the properties of, the individual tests in the set? Specific suggestions are considered for the case in which the test results are normally distributed, but arbitrarily correlated. The discussion is supported by the results of experiments dealing with automatic recognition of hand-printed characters."

Invariant outputs corresponding to such classes are obtained by employing two successive sampled spatial harmonic transforms. The required analyses are equivalent to taking inner products of pairs of vectors only one of which is variable in each case. Subsequently, the necessary network may be realized with fixed threshold logic, independent of the character classes to be recognized. The effectiveness of the property filter has been confirmed with printed and handwritten numerals by coupling it to a standard adaptive categorizer of a type assuming linear separability. There is further evidence to show that performance is improved by coupling a categorizer that does not assume linear separability."

Memory requirements and the time required for classifying a pattern are not excessive, even when there are many classes and many multilevel feature measurements. Two initial steps use univariate distributions of the measurements to select, for a pattern in question, a small subset of neighboring classes. If the pattern is one used in deriving the distributions, its true class is certain to be in the selected subset. The final step distinguishes among the members, if there are more than one, of the subset by using discriminants derivable by classic methods. The technique is tested experimentally on a set of about 26 000 alphabetic characters of nine type fonts. The characters range widely in quality. One third are taken as training patterns from which histograms for the first two steps and discriminants for the third step are derived. The rest are used to test the method.

In statistical recognition systems, pattern information is stored in the machine in the form of pattern characteristics with statistics relating the characteristics to the patterns. If the number of characteristics a system can process is limited, and if the system designer, while able to conceive of a large number of relevant characteristics, does not know which are the most important, then an experimental selection of these characteristics is required. As tools, the designer may have at his disposal a large computer, a large sample of the patterns to be recognized, and a set of programs to measure the characteristics. Thus, he can compare certain statistics relating the patterns to the characteristics. The problem is: what statistics should he calculate in order to select the best characteristics? Assuming the characteristics to be independent in their effect on the decision, this paper examines the notion of a single number statistic for each characteristic which would have certain desirable properties related to the \"goodness\" of the characteristic. It is shown that, in general, no such statistic exists. However, a statistic is proposed which, while not having these properties in general, at least has them in a wide range of situations. An experimental study of the validity of this choice is reported together with the design of a letter recognition system. Using a sample of 15 complete 62 symbol alphabets, 13 characteristics were selected. The resulting system recognized correctly 81.9% of the letters presented to it."

The authors demonstrate a unique method for recognizing patterns composed of straight and curved lines such as characters or edge patterns, independent of position, rotation, size, or slight deformation. The principle of the method is, different from conventional scanning techniques, based on preview controlled curve tracking movement similar to the saccadic motion of the eye. The recognition depends on the time sequence of straight line, curve, angle, intersection, etc. Discrimination between a straight and a curved line, larger or small curvature, and obtuse or acute angle is based on the relative difficulty in tracking the line. For small patterns which lie completely within the field of the detector, a well-known multi-layered recognition device is superior. For larger patterns, however, which lie partially outside the field, the method proposed here is superior. \n \nThe authors think that their method could be useful for the eyes of robots when combined with the kind of multi-layered pattern recognition devices described by Fukushima."

The receptor makes certain measurements on the unknown pattern to be recognized; the categorizer determines from these measurements the particular allowable pattern class to which the unknown pattern belongs. This paper is concerned with the study of a particular class of categorizers, the linear decision function. The optimum linear decision function is the best linear approximation to the optimum decision function in the following sense: 1) \"Optimum\" is taken to mean minimum loss (which includes minimum error systems). 2) \"Linear\" is taken to mean that each pair of pattern classes is separated by one and only one hyperplane in the measurement space. This class of categorizers is of practical interest for two reasons: 1) It can be empirically designed without making any assumptions whatsoever about either the distribution of the receptor measurements or the a priori probabilities of occurrence of the pattern classes, providing an appropriate pattern source is available. 2) Its implementation is quite simple and inexpensive. Various properties of linear decision functions are discussed. One such property is that a linear decision function is guaranteed to perform at least as well as a minimum distance categorizer. Procedures are then developed for the estimation (or design) of the optimum linear decision function based upon an appropriate sampling from the pattern classes to be categorized."

Are you at peace with yourself? Are you thinking about smell and touch, and what happens when people are walking about in a place? But particularly, are you at peace with yourself? All of that is completely disturbed by the pretentiousness, insistence and complicatedness of computer graphics and all the allied techniques. So my final objection to that and to other types of methodology is that they actually prevent you from being in the right state of mind to do the design, quite apart from the question of whether they help in a sort of technical sense, which, as I said, I don't think they do.\""

Most of the present adaptive recognition systems have a priori fixed structure, usually corresponding to a linear decision procedure, and adaptation is performed by parameter optimization. It is apparent that in practice the simple linear system frequently will be an inadequate approximation to the desired boundaries. The central problem in a more general recognition procedure is the selection and analysis of suitable nonlinear relations among measurements. In the system proposed in this paper, the structure adaptation develops as follows: the recognition network initially assumes a linear structure, a set of relations among the input measurements is generated and selected on the basis of a set of design data, and to accomodate these relations, the structure changes to nonlinear. By repetitively generating and selecting additional relations among the measurements, the structure gradually adjusts itself within the class of allowable structures toward an optimal configuration. By means of simulation on a digital computer, the procedure for structure adaptation was successfully applied to a number of practical problems, handwritten numerals, spoken vowels, and electroencephalograms."
