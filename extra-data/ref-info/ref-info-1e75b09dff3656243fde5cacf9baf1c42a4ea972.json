The aim of the system is to read automatically the Italian license number of a car passing through a tollgate. A CCTV camera and a frame grabber card are used to acquire a rear-view image of the vehicle. The recognition process consists of three main phases. First, a segmentation phase locates the license plate within the image. Then, a procedure based upon feature projection estimates some image parameters needed to normalize the license plate characters. Finally, the character recognizer extracts some feature points and uses template matching operators to get a robust solution under multiple acquisition conditions. A test has been done on more than three thousand real images acquired under different weather and illumination conditions, thus obtaining a recognition rate close to 91%. >"

This type of application puts high demands on the reliability of the CLPR-system. A combination of neural and fuzzy techniques is used to guarantee a very low error rate at an acceptable recognition rate. First experiments along highways in the Netherlands show that the system has an error rate, of 0.02% at a recognition rate of 98.51%.

The method uses the gradient map of the image to point at well-defined portions of object boundaries in it. Both the location and gray levels at these boundary points make them good choices for local thresholds. These point values are then interpolated, yielding the threshold surface. A method for fitting a surface to this set of points, which are scattered in a manner unknown in advance, becomes necessary. Several possible approaches are discussed, and the implementation of one of them is described in detail. Two versions of the C.K. Chow and T. Kaneko algorithm (1972) and the present algorithm are applied to a few images, and the latter is shown to give better results, matching human performance quite well.<<ETX>>"

Binarization of scanned gray scale images is the first step in most document image analysis systems. Selection of an appropriate binarization method for an input image domain is a difficult problem. Typically, a human expert evaluates the binarized images according to his/her visual criteria. However, to conduct an objective evaluation, one needs to investigate how well the subsequent image analysis steps will perform on the binarized image. We call this approach goal-directed evaluation, and it can be used to evaluate other low-level image processing methods as well. Our evaluation of binarization methods is in the context of digit recognition, so we define the performance of the character recognition module as the objective measure. Eleven different locally adaptive binarization methods were evaluated, and Niblack's method gave the best performance."

While the mechanisms in the human visual system that do this are unknown, the effect is not too surprising given that temporally adjacent frames in a video sequence contain slightly different, but unique, information. This paper addresses the use of both the spatial and temporal information present in a short image sequence to create a single high-resolution video frame. A novel observation model based on motion compensated subsampling is proposed for a video sequence. Since the reconstruction problem is ill-posed, Bayesian restoration with a discontinuity-preserving prior image model is used to extract a high-resolution video still given a short low-resolution sequence. Estimates computed from a low-resolution image sequence containing a subpixel camera pan show dramatic visual and quantitative improvements over bilinear, cubic B-spline, and Bayesian single frame interpolations. Visual and quantitative improvements are also shown for an image sequence containing objects moving with independent trajectories. Finally, the video frame extraction algorithm is used for the motion-compensated scan conversion of interlaced video data, with a visual comparison to the resolution enhancement obtained from progressively scanned frames."

The flow field, which can be produced by a sensor moving through an environment with several independently moving, rigid objects, is allowed to be sparse, noisy, and partially incorrect. The approach is based on two main stages. In the first stage, the flow field is partitioned into connected segments of flow vectors, where each segment is consistent with a rigid motion of a roughly planar surface. In the second stage, segments are grouped under the hypothesis that they are induced by a single, rigidly moving object. Each hypothesis is tested by searching for three-dimensional (3-D) motion parameters which are compatible with all the segments in the corresponding group. Once the motion parameters are recovered, the relative environmental depth can be estimated as well. Experiments based on real and simulated data are presented."

Although tracking itself is by and large a solved problem, selecting features that can be tracked well and correspond to physical points in the world is still hard. We propose a feature selection criterion that is optimal by construction because it is based on how the tracker works, and a feature monitoring method that can detect occlusions, disocclusions, and features that do not correspond to points in the world. These methods are based on a new tracking algorithm that extends previous Newton-Raphson style search methods to work under affine image transformations. We test performance with several simulations and experiments.<<ETX>>"

The thresholding method, called the local intensity gradient (LIG) method, was implemented in C using a Sun4 host running UNIX. The LIG method was compared against iterative selection (IS), gray level histograms (GLHs) and two correlation based algorithms on a dozen sample images under three different illumination effects. Overall, the LIG method, while it takes significantly longer, properly thresholds a larger set of images than does any other method examined over the sample images tested. >"

They find that the locus of the FOE can be used to make qualitative assertions regarding the type of motion. Interesting behavior of the locus of the FOE for various types of motion is observed. The cases include a single point and a horizontal, a vertical, and a sloped straight line. It was also possible to determine whether the object has approaching or receding motion or when the object changes its direction of motion. This inference can be used in qualitative computer vision. >"

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

It provides an introduction to elementary probability theory and stochastic processes, and shows how probability theory can be applied to the study of phenomena in fields such as engineering, computer science, management science, the physical and social sciences, and operations research. With the addition of several new sections relating to actuaries, this text is highly recommended by the Society of Actuaries. A new section (3.7) on COMPOUND RANDOM VARIABLES, that can be used to establish a recursive formula for computing probability mass functions for a variety of common compounding distributions. A new section (4.11) on HIDDDEN MARKOV CHAINS, including the forward and backward approaches for computing the joint probability mass function of the signals, as well as the Viterbi algorithm for determining the most likely sequence of states. Simplified Approach for Analyzing Nonhomogeneous Poisson processes Additional results on queues relating to the (a) conditional distribution of the number found by an M/M/1 arrival who spends a time t in the system; (b) inspection paradox for M/M/1 queues (c) M/G/1 queue with server breakdown Many new examples and exercises."
