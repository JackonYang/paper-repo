Each part is represented using a simple appearance model and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. While pictorial structures were introduced a number of years ago, they have not been broadly applied to matching and recognition problems. This has been due in part to the computational difficulty of matching pictorial structures to images. In this paper we present an efficient algorithm for finding the best global match of a pictorial stucture to an image. With this improved algorithm, pictorial structures provide a practical and powerful framework for quantitative descriptions of objects and scenes, and are suitable for many generic image recognition problems. We illustrate the approach using simple models of a person and a car."

We extend the popular \"recognition by parts\" shape recognition framework to support \"recognition by functional parts,\" by combining a set of functional primitives and their relations with a set of abstract volumetric shape primitives and their relations. Previous approaches have relied on more global object features, often ignoring the problem of object segmentation and thereby restricting themselves to range images of unoccluded scenes. We show how these shape primitives and relations can be easily recovered from superquadric ellipsoids which, in turn, can be recovered from either range or intensity images of occluded scenes, Furthermore, the proposed framework supports both unexpected (bottom-up) object recognition and expected (top-down) object recognition, We demonstrate the approach on a simple domain by recognizing a restricted class of hand-tools from 2-D images."

We introduce a simplified model of a deformable object class and derive the optimal detector for this model. However, the optimal detector is not realizable except under special circumstances (independent part positions). A cousin of the optimal detector is developed which uses \u201csoft\u201d part detectors with a probabilistic description of the spatial arrangement of the parts. Spatial arrangements are modeled probabilistically using shape statistics to achieve invariance to translation, rotation, and scaling. Improved recognition performance over methods based on \u201chard\u201d part detectors is demonstrated for the problem of face detection in cluttered scenes."

                "text": "The problem of automatically learning object models for recognition and pose estimation is addressed. In contrast to the traditional approach, the recognition problem is formulated as one of matching appearance rather than shape. The appearance of an object in a two-dimensional image depends on its shape, reflectance properties, pose in the scene, and the illumination conditions. While shape and reflectance are intrinsic properties and constant for a rigid object, pose and illumination vary from scene to scene. A compact representation of object appearance is proposed that is parametrized by pose and illumination. For each object of interest, a large set of images is obtained by automatically varying pose and illumination. This image set is compressed to obtain a low-dimensional subspace, called the eigenspace, in which the object is represented as a manifold. Given an unknown input image, the recognition system projects the image to eigenspace. The object is recognized based on the manifold it lies on. The exact position of the projection on the manifold determines the object's pose in the image.A variety of experiments are conducted using objects with complex appearance characteristics. The performance of the recognition and pose estimation algorithms is studied using over a thousand input images of sample objects. Sensitivity of recognition to the number of eigenspace dimensions and the number of learning samples is analyzed. For the objects used, appearance representation in eigenspaces with less than 20 dimensions produces accurate recognition results with an average pose estimation error of about 1.0 degree. A near real-time recognition system with 20 complex objects in the database has been developed. The paper is concluded with a discussion on various issues related to the proposed learning and recognition methodology."

We show how to find people by finding candidate body segments, and then constructing assemblies of segments that are consistent with the constraints on the appearance of a person that result from kinematic properties. Since a reasonable model of a person requires at least nine segments, it is not possible to inspect every group, due to the huge combinatorial complexity.We propose two approaches to this problem. In one, the search can be pruned by using projected versions of a classifier that accepts groups corresponding to people. We describe an efficient projection algorithm for one popular classifier, and demonstrate that our approach can be used to determine whether images of real scenes contain people.The second approach employs a probabilistic framework, so that we can draw samples of assemblies, with probabilities proportional to their likelihood, which allows to draw human-like assemblies more often than the non-person ones. The main performance problem is in segmentation of images, but the overall results of both approaches on real images of people are encouraging."

We develop a new method for computing a transformation from a three-dimensional model coordinate frame to the two-dimensional image coordinate frame, using three pairs of model and image points. We show that this transformation always exists for three noncollinear points, and is unique up to a reflective ambiguity. The solution method is closed-form and only involves second-order equations. We have implemented a recognition system that uses this transformation method to determine possible alignments of a model with an image. Each of these hypothesized matches is verified by comparing the entire edge contours of the aligned object with the image edges. Using the entire edge contours for verification, rather than a few local feature points, reduces the chance of finding false matches. The system has been tested on partly occluded objects in highly cluttered scenes."

We divide detection into visual selection and final classification, concentrating on the former: drastically reducing the number of candidate regions that require further, usually more intensive, processing, but with a minimum of computation and missed detections. Bottom-up processing is based on local groupings of edge fragments constrained by loose geometrical relationships. They have no a priori semantic or geometric interpretation. The role of training is to select special groupings that are moderately likely at certain places on the object but rare in the background. We show that the statistics in both populations are stable. The candidate regions are those that contain global arrangements of several local groupings. Whereas our model was not conceived to explain brain functions, it does cohere with evidence about the functions of neurons in V1 and V2, such as responses to coarse or incomplete patterns (e.g., illusory contours) and to scale and translation invariance in IT. Finally, the algorithm is applied to face and symbol detection."

We define a \"card-board person model\" in which a person's limbs are represented by a set of connected planar patches. The parametrized image motion of these patches in constrained to enforce articulated motion and is solved for directly using a robust estimation technique. The recovered motion parameters provide a rich and concise description of the activity that can be used for recognition. We propose a method for performing view-based recognition of human activities from the optical flow parameters that extends previous methods to cope with the cyclical nature of human motion. We illustrate the method with examples of tracking human legs of long image sequences."

Three key ideas render the implementation of this framework practical. First, the shape space is partitioned by defining an equivalence class on shapes, where two shapes with the same shock graph topology are considered to be equivalent. Second, the space of deformations is discretized by defining all deformations with the same sequence of shock graph transitions as equivalent. Shock transitions are points along the deformation where the shock graph topology changes. Third, we employ a graph edit distance algorithm that searches in the space of all possible transition sequences and finds the globally optimal sequence in polynomial time. The effectiveness of the proposed technique in the presence of a variety of visual transformations including occlusion, articulation and deformation of parts, shadow and highlights, viewpoint variation, and boundary perturbations is demonstrated. Indexing into two separate databases of roughly 100 shapes results in accuracy for top three matches and for the next three matches."

By segmentation, we mean a map from the set of pixels to a small set of levels such that each connected component of the set of pixels with the same level forms a relatively large and \"meaningful\" region. The method finds a set of levels with associated gray values by first finding junctions in the image and then seeking a minimum set of threshold values that preserves the junctions. Then it finds a segmentation map that maps each pixel to the level with the closest gray value to the pixel data, within a smoothness constraint. For a convex smoothing penalty, we show the global optimal solution for an energy function that fits the data can be obtained in a polynomial time, by a novel use of the maximum-flow algorithm. Our approach is in contrast to a view in computer vision where segmentation is driven by intensity, gradient, usually not yielding closed boundaries."

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture."

RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing"

The approach operates by examining all hypotheses about pairings between sensed data and object surfaces and efficiently discarding inconsistent ones by using local constraints on: distances between faces, angles between face normals, and angles (relative to the surface normals) of vectors between sensed points. The method described here is an extension of a method for recognition and localization of nonoverlapping parts previously described in [18] and [15]."

We introduce the use of a novel mathematical technique, the product of exponential maps and twist motions, and its integration into a differential motion estimation. This results in solving simple linear systems, and enables us to recover robustly the kinematic degrees-of-freedom in noise and complex self occluded configurations. We demonstrate this on several image sequences of people doing articulated full body movements, and visualize the results in re-animating an artificial 3D human model. We are also able to recover and re-animate the famous movements of Eadweard Muybridge's motion studies from the last century. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computer vision based system that is able to process such challenging footage and recover complex motions with such high accuracy."

Thus, this distance can be used to determine the degree of resemblance between two objects that are superimposed on one another. Efficient algorithms for computing the Hausdorff distance between all possible relative positions of a binary image and a model are presented. The focus is primarily on the case in which the model is only allowed to translate with respect to the image. The techniques are extended to rigid motion. The Hausdorff distance computation differs from many other shape comparison methods in that no correspondence between the model and the image is derived. The method is quite tolerant of small position errors such as those that occur with edge detectors and other feature extraction methods. It is shown that the method extends naturally to the problem of comparing a portion of a model against an image. >"

Our flexible algorithm is designed to match curves under substantial deformations and arbitrary large scaling and rigid transformations. A syntactic representation is constructed for both curves and an edit transformation which maps one curve to the other is found using dynamic programming. We present extensive experiments where we apply the algorithm to silhouette matching. In these experiments, we examine partial occlusion, viewpoint variation, articulation, and class matching (where silhouettes of similar objects are matched). Based on the qualitative syntactic matching, we define a dissimilarity measure and we compute it for every pair of images in a database of 121 images. We use this experiment to objectively evaluate our algorithm. First, we compare our results to those reported by others. Second, we use the dissimilarity values in order to organize the image database into shape categories. The veridical hierarchical organization stands as evidence to the quality of our matching and similarity estimation."

Moving people are modeled with the assumption that, while configuration can vary quite substantially from frame to frame, appearance does not. This leads to an algorithm that firstly builds a model of the appearance of the body of each individual by clustering candidate body segments, and then uses this model to find all individuals in each frame. Unusually, the tracker does not rely on a model of human dynamics to identify possible instances of people; such models are unreliable, because human motion is fast and large accelerations are common. We show our tracking algorithm can be interpreted as a loopy inference procedure on an underlying Bayes net. Experiments on video of real scenes demonstrate that this tracker can (a) count distinct individuals; (b) identify and track them; (c) recover when it loses track, for example, if individuals are occluded or briefly leave the view; (d) identify the configuration of the body largely correctly; and (e) is not dependent on particular models of human motion."

Using this hierarchical structure reduces the computational load significantly. The algorithm is reasonably simple to implement and is insensitive to noise and other disturbances. The algorithm has been tested in several applications. Two of them are briefly presented. In the first application the outlines of common tools are matched to gray-level images of the same tools, with overlapping. In the second application lake edges from aerial photographs are matched to lake edges from a map, with translation, rotation, scale, and perspective changes. The hierarchical chamfer matching algorithm gives correct results using a reasonable amount of computational resources in all tested applications. >"

In this paper we discuss the background of Gaussian filtering and look at some methods for implementing it. Consideration of the central limit theorem suggests using a cascade of ``simple'' filters as a means of computing Gaussian filters. Among ``simple'' filters, uniform-coefficient finite-impulse-response digital filters are especially economical to implement. The idea of cascaded uniform filters has been around for a while [13], [16]. We show that this method is economical to implement, has good filtering characteristics, and is appropriate for hardware implementation. We point out an equivalence to one of Burt's methods [1], [3] under certain circumstances. As an extension, we describe an approach to implementing a Gaussian Pyramid which requires approximately two addition operations per pixel, per level, per dimension. We examine tradeoffs in choosing an algorithm for Gaussian filtering, and finally discuss an implementation."

The major restriction is that the energy function's smoothness term must only involve pairs of pixels. We propose two algorithms that use graph cuts to compute a local minimum even when very large moves are allowed. The first move we consider is an /spl alpha/-/spl beta/-swap: for a pair of labels /spl alpha/,/spl beta/, this move exchanges the labels between an arbitrary set of pixels labeled a and another arbitrary set labeled /spl beta/. Our first algorithm generates a labeling such that there is no swap move that decreases the energy. The second move we consider is an /spl alpha/-expansion: for a label a, this move assigns an arbitrary set of pixels the label /spl alpha/. Our second algorithm, which requires the smoothness term to be a metric, generates a labeling such that there is no expansion move that decreases the energy. Moreover, this solution is within a known factor of the global minimum. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration, stereo and motion."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty\u0097and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition\u0097in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability."

                "text": "THE recognition of periodicities, their amplitude and length, is one of the main tasks of the application of statistics to long-range data and especially to economic phenomena. Although numerous theorems have been developed, the question of how to recognize a cycle remains open, since the complicated mathematical methods used in the periodogram and correlogram analysis may generate both real and factitious cycles and may conceal real ones. Therefore, the study of cycles is a fertile field for nonscientific procedures. Since even a constant value in a certain interval can easily be reproduced by a Fourier series, cycles with superimposed epicycles and third and fourth cycles have been \"found\" in nearly every domain that may be represented by numbers. Different observers have found different cycles in the same series-not to mention the great cycles of history leading to forecasts, good advices and policies advocated by their prophets. This abuse has discredited the whole theory of cycles. In contrast to these procedures, we examine here a specialized distribution function. Applications to recurrent phenomena of known period will be given in a second article. Since the distribution function has only two disposable parameters, and since we consider using it only in connection with such phenomena as seasonal or diurnal variations-where the length of period is definitely established from nonstatistical considerations-we feel that the chance of generating false cycles is small indeed. The distribution function under discussion was tabulated because it possesses important theoretical properties of the linear normal distribution and because it has practical applications to such meteoric phenomena as the direction of the wind, which is an angular or \"circular\" variable. Wind directions are represented clockwise on the map from north to east, south, west, and back to north in the same way as an angle varies from zero to 2ir. Each direction or angle has a"

This is one of two 338 domains that we use to illustrate the pictorial struc339 tures approach. Two different methods are reported in 340 Ioffe and Forsyth (2001). The first method makes bi341 nary decisions about the possible locations for indi342 vidual parts and subsequently searches for groups of 343 parts that match the overall model."

Moreover, most part314 based methods use some kind of search heuristics, such 315 as first matching a particular \u201cdistinctive\u201d part and then 316 searching for other parts given that initial match, in or317 der to avoid the combinatorial explosion of the con318 figuration space. Such heuristics make it difficult to 319 handle occlusion, particularly for those parts that are 320 considered first in the search. 321 In Burl et al. (1998) models similar to pictorial struc322 tures were used to represent objects in terms of a con323 stellation of local features. In these models, rather than 324 there being connections between pairs of parts, all the 325 parts are constrained with respect to a central coor326 dinate system using a Gaussian distribution. Like the 327 pictorial structures formulation, no binary decisions are 328 made about part or feature locations. These models, 329 however, are not well suited for representing articu330 lated objects, as a joint Gaussian distribution cannot 331 capture multiple articulation points. Moreover, in Burl 332 et al. (1998) the matching algorithms use heuristics that 333 don\u2019t necessarily find the optimal match of a model to 334 an image. 335 The problem of finding people in images using 336 coarse part-based two-dimensional models was con337 sidered in Ioffe and Forsyth (2001). This is one of two 338 domains that we use to illustrate the pictorial struc339 tures approach."
