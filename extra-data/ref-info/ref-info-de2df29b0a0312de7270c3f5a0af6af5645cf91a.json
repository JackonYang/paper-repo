The statistical translation approach uses two types of information: a translation model and a language model. The language model used is a bigram or general m-gram model. The translation model is decomposed into a lexical and an alignment model. We describe two different approaches for statistical translation and present experimental results. The first approach is based on dependencies between single words, the second approach explicitly takes shallow phrase structures into account, using two different alignment levels: a phrase level alignment between phrases and a word level alignment between single words. We present results using the Verbmobil task (German-English, 6000word vocabulary) which is a limited-domain spoken-language task. The experimental tests were performed on both the text transcription and the speech recognizer output. 1 S t a t i s t i c a l M a c h i n e T r a n s l a t i o n The goal of machine translation is the translation of a text given in some source language into a target language.

This translation approach allows for general many-to-many relations between words. Thereby, the context of words is taken into account in the translation model, and local changes in word order from source to target language can be learned explicitly. The model is described using a log-linear modeling approach, which is a generalization of the often used source-channel approach. Thereby, the model is easier to extend than classical statistical machine translation systems. We describe in detail the process for learning phrasal translations, the feature functions used, and the search algorithm. The evaluation of this approach is performed on three different tasks. For the German-English speech Verbmobil task, we analyze the effect of various system components. On the French-English Canadian Hansards task, the alignment template system obtains significantly better results than a single-word-based translation model. In the Chinese-English 2002 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) machine translation evaluation it yields statistically significantly better NIST scores than all competing research and commercial translation systems."

We define a concept of word-by-word alignment between such pairs of sentences. For any given pair of such sentences each of our models assigns a probability to each of the possible word-by-word alignments. We give an algorithm for seeking the most probable of these alignments. Although the algorithm is suboptimal, the alignment thus obtained accounts well for the word-by-word relationships in the pair of sentences. We have a great deal of data in French and English from the proceedings of the Canadian Parliament. Accordingly, we have restricted our work to these two languages; but we feel that because our algorithms have minimal linguistic content they would work well on other pairs of languages. We also feel, again because of the minimal linguistic content of our algorithms, that it is reasonable to argue that word-by-word alignments are inherent in any sufficiently large bilingual corpus."

The idea of the model is to make the alignment probabilities dependent on the differences in the alignment positions rather than on the absolute positions. To achieve this goal, the approach uses a first-order Hidden Markov model (HMM) for the word alignment problem as they are used successfully in speech recognition for the time alignment problem. The difference to the time alignment HMM is that there is no monotony constraint for the possible word orderings. We describe the details of the model and test the model on several bilingual corpora."

                "text": "This paper presents an algorithm capable of identifying the translation for each word in a bilingual corpus. Previously proposed methods rely heavily on word-based statistics. Under a word-based approach, frequent words with a consistent translation can be aligned at a high rate of precision. However, words that are less frequent or exhibit diverse translations generally do not have statistically significant evidence for confident alignment, thereby leading to incomplete or incorrect alignments. The algorithm proposed herein attempts to broaden coverage by exploiting lexicographic resources. To this end, we draw on the two classification systems of words in Longman Lexicon of Contemporary English (LLOCE) and Tongyici Cilin (Synonym Forest, CILIN). Automatically acquired class-based alignment rules are used to compensate for what is lacking in a bilingual dictionary such as the English-Chinese version of the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LecDOCE). In addition, this alignment method is implemented using LecDOCE examples and their translations for training and testing, while further examples from a technical manual in both English and Chinese are used for an open test. Quantitative results of the closed and open tests are also summarized."

The statistical translation approach uses two types of information: a translation model and a language model. The language model used is a bigram or general m-gram model. The translation model is decomposed into a lexical model and an alignment model. There are three approaches that are presented and tested in detail: the quasi-monotone alignment approach, the inverted alignment approach, and the alignment template approach. For each of these three approaches, a suitable search method is presented. The system has been tested on a limited-domain spoken-language task for which a bilingual corpus is available: the Verbmobil task (German-English, 7000-word vocabulary). We present experimental results for each of the three approaches. The experimental tests were performed on both the text transcription and the speech recognizer output."

However, one of the open problems with Statistical Machine Translation is the design of efficient algorithms for translating a given input string. For some interesting models, only (good) approximate solutions can be found. Recently a Dynamic Programming-like algorithm has been introduced which computes approximate solutions for some models. These solutions can be improved by using an iterative algorithm that refines the succesive solutions and uses a smoothing technique for some probabilistic distribution of the models based on an interpolation of different distributions. The technique resulting from this combination has been tested on the \u201cTourist Task\u201d corpus, which was generated in a semi-automated way. The best results achieved were a word-error rate of 9.3% and a sentence-error rate of 44.4%."

The program takes the output of char_align (Church, 1993), a robust alternative to sentence-based alignment programs, and applies word-level constraints using a version of Brown et al.\u2019s Model 2 (Brown et al., 1993), modified and extended to deal with robustness issues. Word_align was tested on a subset of Canadian Hansards supplied by Simard (Simard et al., 1992). The combination of word_align plus char_align reduces the variance (average square error) by a factor of 5 over char_align alone. More importantly, because word_align and char_align were designed to work robustly on texts that are smaller and more noisy than the Hansards, it has been possible to successfully deploy the programs at AT&T Language Line Services, a commercial translation service, to help them with difficult terminology."

While this method produces surprisingly good results (a success rate around 96%), even better results are required to perform such tasks as the computer-assisted revision of translations. In this paper, we examine some of the weaknesses of Gale and Church's program, and explain how just a small amount of linguistic knowledge would help to overcome these weaknesses. We discuss how cognates provide for a cheap and reasonably reliable source of linguistic knowledge. To illustrate this, we describe a modification to the program in which the criterion is cognates rather than sentence lengths. Finally, we show how better and more efficient results may be obtained by combining the two criteria length and \"cogneteness\". Our method can be generalized to accommodate other sources of linguistic knowledge, and experimentation shows that it produces better results than alignments based on length alone, at a minimal cost."

Case studies include French, Chinese, Czech and Spanish.Existing text analysis tools for English are applied to bilingual text corpora and their output projected onto the second language via statistically derived word alignments. Simple direct annotation projection is quite noisy, however, even with optimal alignments. Thus this paper presents noise-robust tagger, bracketer and lemmatizer training procedures capable of accurate system bootstrapping from noisy and incomplete initial projections.Performance of the induced stand-alone part-of-speech tagger applied to French achieves 96% core part-of-speech (POS) tag accuracy, and the corresponding induced noun-phrase bracketer exceeds 91% F-measure. The induced morphological analyzer achieves over 99% lemmatization accuracy on the complete French verbal system.This achievement is particularly noteworthy in that it required absolutely no hand-annotated training data in the given language, and virtually no language-specific knowledge or resources beyond raw text. Performance also significantly exceeds that obtained by direct annotation projection."

We describe a program named Champollion which, given a pair of parallel corpora in two different languages and a list of collocations in one of them, automatically produces their translations. Our goal is to provide a tool for compiling bilingual lexical information above the word level in multiple languages, for different domains. The algorithm we use is based on statistical methods and produces p-word translations of n-word collocations in which n and p need not be the same. For example, Champollion translates make...decision, employment equity, and stock market into prendre...decision, equite en matiere d'emploi, and bourse respectively. Testing Champollion on three years' worth of the Hansards corpus yielded the French translations of 300 collocations for each year, evaluated at 73% accuracy on average. In this paper, we describe the statistical measures used, the algorithm, and the implementation of Champollion, presenting our results and evaluation."

Current statistical techniques uncover translation rules from bilingual training texts and use those rules to translate new texts. The general architecture is the source-channel model: an English string is statistically generated (source), then statistically transformed into French (channel). In order to translate (or \"decode\") a French string, we look for the most likely English source. We show that for the simplest form of statistical models, this problem is NP-complete, i.e., probably exponential in the length of the observed sentence. We trace this complexity to factors not present in other decoding problems."

This article presents methods for biasing statistical translation models to reflect these properties. Evaluation with respect to independent human judgments has confirmed that translation models biased in this fashion are significantly more accurate than a baseline knowledge-free model. This article also shows how a statistical translation model can take advantage of preexisting knowledge that might be available about particular language pairs. Even the simplest kinds of language-specific knowledge, such as the distinction between content words and function words, are shown to reliably boost translation model performance on some tasks. Statistical models that reflect knowledge about the model domain combine the best of both the rationalist and empiricist paradigms."

In an attempt to bootstrap some of the required linguistic resources for some of those languages, this paper presents an unsupervised method for automatic multilingual word sense tagging using parallel corpora. The method is evaluated on the English Brown corpus and its translation into three different languages: French, German and Spanish. A preliminary evaluation of the proposed method yielded results of up to 79% accuracy rate for the English data on 81.8% of the SemCor manually tagged data."

These annotations are freely available to the research community from this http URL . The annotations can be used for several purposes. First, they can be used as a standard data set for developing and testing translation lexicons and statistical translation models. Second, researchers in lexical semantics will be able to mine the annotations for insights about cross-linguistic lexicalization patterns. Third, the annotations can be used in research into certain recently proposed methods for monolingual word-sense disambiguation. This paper describes the annotated texts, the specially-designed annotation tool, and the strategies employed to increase the consistency of the annotations. The annotation process was repeated five times by different annotators. Inter-annotator agreement rates indicate that the annotations are reasonably reliable and that the method is easy to replicate."

The algorithm combines four original alignment models based on relative corpus frequency, contextual similarity, weighted string similarity and incrementally retrained inflectional transduction probabilities. Starting with no paired examples for training and no prior seeding of legal morphological transformations, accuracy of the induced analyses of 3888 past-tense test cases in English exceeds 99.2% for the set, with currently over 80% accuracy on the most highly irregular forms and 99.7% accuracy on forms exhibiting non-concatenative suffixation."

We show how to model at least a part of the information contained in a bilingual dictionary so that we can treat a bilingual dictionary and a bilingual corpus as two facets of a unified collection of data from which to extract values for the parameters of a probabilistic machine translation system. We give an algorithm for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of a probabilistic model from this combined data and we show how these parameters are affected by inclusion of the dictionary for some sample words."

The decoder's job is to find the translation that is most likely according to set of previously learned parameters (and a formula for combining them). Since the space of possible translations is extremely large, typical decoding algorithms are only able to examine a portion of it, thus risking to miss good solutions. In this paper, we compare the speed and output quality of a traditional stack-based decoding algorithm with two new decoders: a fast greedy decoder and a slow but optimal decoder that treats decoding as an integer-programming optimization problem."
