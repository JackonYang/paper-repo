Detecting rotated faces is a two step procedure. First a \\DeRotation\" network is used to process each input window. If there is a face in the window, this network determines its angle of rotation. Based upon this estimated angle of rotation, the window is then rotated to an upright position. Second, a \\Detection\" network, or multiple detection networks, are used to determine whether the rotated window contained an upright face. The training methods for both networks are presented. Preliminary empirical results are also provided."

We demonstrate our technique in the context of face detection with complex background without color or motion information, which has proven to be a challenging problem. We use a family of discrete Markov processes to model the face and background patterns and estimate the probability models using the data statistics. Then, we convert the learning process into an optimization, selecting the Markov process that optimizes the information-based discrimination between the two classes. The detection process is carried out by computing the likelihood ratio using the probability model obtained from the learning procedure. We show that because of the discrete nature of these models, the detection process is at least two orders of magnitude less computationally expensive than neural network approaches. However, no improvement in terms of correct-answer/false-alarm tradeoff is achieved."

With technological advance on microelectronic and vision system, high performance automatic techniques on biometric recognition are now becoming economically feasible. Among all the biometric identification methods, face recognition has attracted much attention in recent years because it has potential to be most nonintrusive and user-friendly. The PDBNN face recognition system consists of three modules: First, a face detector finds the location of a human face in an image. Then an eye localizer determines the positions of both eyes in order to generate meaningful feature vectors. The facial region proposed contains eyebrows, eyes, and nose, but excluding mouth (eye-glasses will be allowed). Lastly, the third module is a face recognizer. The PDBNN can be effectively applied to all the three modules. It adopts a hierarchical network structures with nonlinear basis functions and a competitive credit-assignment scheme. The paper demonstrates a successful application of PDBNN to face recognition applications on two public (FERET and ORL) and one in-house (SCR) databases. Regarding the performance, experimental results on three different databases such as recognition accuracies as well as false rejection and false acceptance rates are elaborated. As to the processing speed, the whole recognition process (including PDBNN processing for eye localization, feature extraction, and classification) consumes approximately one second on Sparc10, without using hardware accelerator or co-processor."

Though numerous attempts have been made to detect and localize faces, these approaches have made assumptions that restrict their extension to more general cases. In this research, we propose a feature-based face detection algorithm that can be easily extended to detect faces under diierent scale and orientation. Feature points are detected from the image using spatial lters and grouped into face candidates using geometric and gray level constraints. A probabilistic framework is then used to evaluate the likelihood of the candidate as a face. We provide results to support the validity of the approach, and show that the algorithm can indeed cope eeciently with faces at diierent scale and orientation."

GAT trees use a two-stage divide-and-conquer tree-type approach. The first stage determines general properties of the input, such as whether the facial image contains glasses or a beard. The second stage identifies the individual. Face perception classification, detection of front faces with glasses and/or beards, and face recognition results using GAT trees under laboratory conditions are presented. We conclude that the neural network group-based model offers significant improvement over conventional neural network trees for this task."

Recent e orts at our lab are aimed at providing such multimodal capabilities for human-machine communication as well by introducing gesture, character and speech recognition, eye-tracking and lipreading. Most of the visual modalities require a stable image of a speaker's face. In this technical report a connectionist face tracker is proposed that manipulates camera orientation and zoom, to keep a person's face located at all times in an image sequence. The system operates in real time and can adapt rapidly to di erent lighting conditions, di erent cameras and faces, making it robust against environmental variability. Extensions and integration of the system with a multimodal interface will be presented."

A view-based multiple-observer eigenspace technique is proposed for use in face recognition under variable pose. In addition, a modular eigenspace description technique is used which incorporates salient features such as the eyes, nose and mouth, in an eigenfeature layer. This modular representation yields higher recognition rates as well as a more robust framework for face recognition.

These hypotheses are then verified using a second neural network. The algorithm applies to images where the size of the faces is unknown a priori. The computational time which is necessary for the complete processing of an image is reasonable. With a classical workstation an image of size 512*512 is treated in 50 seconds including smoothing and normalization of the image. This algorithm can be easily installed on a more specialized machine as the major part of the operation is based on convolutions with kernels of size 5*5 or 8*8. In this paper, the authors assume that the face are well oriented in the image. It is possible to eliminate this assumption by following an approach similar to the one used for the scale problem. A net is trained to be insensitive to the precise orientation of the face. This kind of segmentation algorithm can be applied to other problems where the objects to be detected cannot be characterized easily by its outline or by classical primitives in image processing."

Faces are represented by labeled graphs, based on a Gabor wavelet transform. Image graphs of new faces are extracted by an elastic graph matching process and can be compared by a simple similarity function. The system differs from Lades et al. (1993) in three respects. Phase information is used for accurate node positioning. Object-adapted graphs are used to handle large rotations in depth. Image graph extraction is based on a novel data structure, the bunch graph, which is constructed from a small set of sample image graphs."

We also use 3D depth information of a human head to detect the presence of an actual person as opposed to an image of that person.

Image regions of interest are determined using a detection stage, each region is then enhanced (the steps used are detailed), features are extracted (new Gabor wavelet features are used), and these features are used to classify the contents of each input region. A new feature space trajectory neural network (FST NN) classifier is used. A new 8 class database is used, a new multilayer NN to calculate the distance measures necessary is detailed, its low storage and on-line computational load requirements are noted. The ability of the adaptive FST algorithm to reduce network complexity while achieving excellent performance is demonstrated. The clutter rejection ability of this neural network to reject false alarm inputs is demonstrated, and time-history processing to further reduce false alarms is discussed. Hardware and commercial realizations are noted."

Vapnik and his team (AT&T Bell Labs., 1985) that can be seen as a new method for training polynomial, neural network, or Radial Basis Functions classifiers. The decision surfaces are found by solving a linearly constrained quadratic programming problem. This optimization problem is challenging because the quadratic form is completely dense and the memory requirements grow with the square of the number of data points. We present a decomposition algorithm that guarantees global optimality, and can be used to train SVM's over very large data sets. The main idea behind the decomposition is the iterative solution of sub-problems and the evaluation of optimality conditions which are used both to generate improved iterative values, and also establish the stopping criteria for the algorithm. We present experimental results of our implementation of SVM, and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a face detection problem that involves a data set of 50,000 data points."

As an actual example, we developed a system that associates faces and names in videos, called Name-It, which is given news videos as a knowledge source, then automatically extracts face and name association as content information. The system can infer the name of a given unknown face image, or guess faces which are likely to have the name given to the system. This paper explains the method with several successful matching results which reveal effectiveness in integrating heterogeneous techniques as well as the importance of real content information extraction from video, especially face-name association."

We combine stereo, color, and face detection modules into a single robust system, and show an initial application in an interactive, face-responsive display. Dense, real-time stereo processing is used to isolate users from other objects and people in the background. Skin-hue classification identifies and tracks likely body parts within the silhouette of a user. Face pattern detection discriminates and localizes the face within the identified body parts. Faces and bodies of users are tracked over several temporal scales: short-term (user stays within the field of view), medium-term (user exits/reenters within minutes), and long term (user returns after hours or days). Short-term tracking is performed using simple region position and size correspondences, while medium and long-term tracking are based on statistics of user appearance. We discuss the failure modes of each individual module, describe our integration method, and report results with the complete system in trials with thousands of users."

It can track a person's face while the person moves freely (e.g., walks, jumps, sits down and stands up) in a room. Three types of models have been employed in developing the system. First, they present a stochastic model to characterize skin color distributions of human faces. The information provided by the model is sufficient for tracking a human face in various poses and views. This model is adaptable to different people and different lighting conditions in real-time. Second, a motion model is used to estimate image motion and to predict the search window. Third, a camera model is used to predict and compensate for camera motion. The system can be applied to teleconferencing and many HCI applications including lip reading and gaze tracking. The principle in developing this system can be extended to other tracking problems such as tracking the human hand."

In contrast to traditional strategies that rely on object geometry and local image features, the present system is founded on the concept of appearance matching. Appearance manifolds of the 100 objects were automatically learned using a computer-controlled turntable. The entire learning process was completed in 1 day. A recognition loop has been implemented that performs scene change detection, image segmentation, region normalizations, and appearance matching, in less than 1 second. The hardware used by the recognition system includes no more than a CCD color camera and a workstation. The real-time capability and interactive nature of the system have allowed numerous observers to test its performance. To quantify performance, we have conducted controlled experiments on recognition and pose estimation. The recognition rate was found to be 100% and object pose was estimated with a mean absolute error of 2.02 degrees and standard deviation of 1.67 degrees."

The key problem in creating a specific flexible model is the computation of pixelwise correspondence between the prototypes, a task done until now in a semiautomatic way. In this paper we describe an algorithm that automatically bootstraps the correspondence between the prototypes. The algorithm -which can be used for 2D images as well as for 3D models-is shown to synthesize successfully a flexible model of frontal face images and a flexible model of handwritten digits."

                "text": "Object and pattern detection is a classical computer vision problem with many potential applications, ranging from automatic target recognition to image-based industrial inspection tasks in assembly lines. While there have been some successful object and pattern detection systems in the past, most such systems handle only specific rigid objects or patterns that can be accurately described by fixed geometric models or pictorial templates. \nThis thesis presents a learning based approach for detecting classes of objects and patterns with variable image appearance but highly predictable image boundaries. Some examples of such object and pattern classes include human faces, aerial views of structured terrain features like volcanoes, localized material defect signatures in industrial parts, certain tissue anomalies in medical images, and instances of a given digit or character, which may be written or printed in many different styles. \nThe thesis consists of two parts. In part one, we introduce our object and pattern detection approach using a concrete human face detection example. The approach first builds a distribution-based model of the target pattern class in an appropriate feature space to describe the target's variable image appearance. It then learns from examples a similarity measure for matching new patterns against the distribution-based target model. We also discuss some pertinent learning issues, including ideas on virtual example generation and example selection. The approach makes few assumptions about the target pattern class and should therefore be fairly general, as long as the target class has predictable image boundaries. We show that this is indeed the case by demonstrating the technique on two other pattern detection/recognition problems. \nBecause our object and pattern detection approach is very much learning-based, how well a system eventually performs depends heavily on the quality of training examples it receives. The second part of this thesis looks at how one can select high quality examples for function approximation learning tasks. Active learning is an area of research that investigates how a learner can intelligently select future training examples to get better approximation results with less data. We propose an active learning formulation for function approximation, and show for three specific approximation function classes, that the active example selection strategy learns its target with fewer data samples than random sampling. Finally, we simplify the original active learning formulation, and show how it leads to a tractable example selection paradigm, suitable for use in many object and pattern detection problems.

As a recognition task, the speaker-dependent recognition of the phonemes B, D, and G in varying phonetic contexts was chosen. For comparison, several discrete hidden Markov models (HMM) were trained to perform the same task. Performance evaluation over 1946 testing tokens from three speakers showed that the TDNN achieves a recognition rate of 98.5% correct while the rate obtained by the best of the HMMs was only 93.7%. >"
