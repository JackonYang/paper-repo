In a distributed neural network architecture each symbol is represented by activity in many units and each unit contributes to the representation of many symbols. Manipulating symbols using this type of distributed representation is not as easy as with a local representation whore each unit denotes one symbol, but there is evidence that the distributed approach is the one chosen by nature. We describe a working implementation of a production system interpreter in a neural network using distributed representations for both symbols and rules. The research provides a detailed account of two important symbolic reasoning operations, pattern matching and variable binding, as emergent properties of collections of neuron-like elements. The success of our production system implementation goes some way towards answering a common criticism of connectionist theories: that they aren't powerful enough to do symbolic reasoning."

More recently, Fodor and Pylyshyn have made a sweeping claim the connectionist systems cannot incorporate systematicity and compositionality. These comments suggest that representing structured knowledge in a connectionist network and using this knowledge in a systematic way is considered difficult if not impossible. The work reported in this paper demonstrates that a connectionist system can not only represent structured knowledge and display systematic behavior, but it can also do so with extreme efficiency. The paper describes a connectionist system that can represent knowledge expressed as rules and facts involving multi-place predicates (i.e., n-ary relates), and draw limited, but sound, inferences based on this knowledge."

                "text": "Given a \u0302 network of simple computing elements and some entities to be represented, the most straightforward scheme is to use one computing element for each entity. This is called a local representation. It is easy to understand and easy to implement because the structure of the physical network mirrors the structure of the knowledge it contains. This report describes a different type of representation that is less familiar and harder to think about than local representations. Each entity is represented by a pattern of activity distributed over many computing elements, and each computing element is involved in representing many different entities. The strength of this more complicated kind of representation does not lie in its notational convenience or its ease of implementation in a conventional computer, but rather in the efficiency with which it makes use of the processing abilities of networks of simple, neuron-like computing elements. Every representational scheme has its good and bad points. Distributed representations are no exception. Some desirable properties like content-addressable memory and automatic generalization arise very naturally from the use of patterns of activity as representations. Other properties, like the ability to temporarily store a large set of arbitrary associations, are much harder to achieve. The best psychological evidence for distributed representations is the degree to which their strengths and weaknesses match those of the human mind. ^This research was supported by a grant from the System Development Foundation.

Restricted formulations of these questions are addressed by analysis within a new mathematical framework that describes stochastic parallel computation. An algorithm is given for simulating this computation once schemas encoding the modules of the environment have been selected. The concept of computational temperature is introduced. As this temperature is lowered, the system appears to display a dramatic tendency to interpret input, even if the evidence for any particular interpretation is very weak."

This approach is most effective in well characterized domains where any valid chain of inference from a set of observations leads to an acceptable interpretation. In more realistic cases where there are multiple consistent interpretations that are not equally good, or where there are no consistent interpretations, it seems more natural to choose the best alternative based on the interpretations themselves rather than the chains of inference used to derive them. \u00b5KLONE is a connectionist network which uses simulated annealing to search the space of interpretations, or models. Inconsistent theories lead to generation of models which come as close as possible to satisfying all of the axioms, so counterfactual reasoning can be accomplished by the same mechanism as factual reasoning. An example involving conflicting information is presented for which \u00b5KLONE finds an intuitively plausible interpretation."

A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices."

This compulation can be implemented in a parallel network of neuron-like processors, but the network has a tendency to make errors of a peculiar kind: When presented with several shapes it sometimes perceives one shape in the position of another. The parameters can be carefully tuned to avoid these \"illusory conjunctions\" in normal circumstances, but they reappear if the visual input is replaced by a random mask before the network has settled down. Treisman and Schmidt (1982) have shown that people make similar errors."

The propagation of activation in these networks is determined by dissipative differential equations. The error signal is backpropagated by integrating an associated differential equation. The method is introduced by applying it to the recurrent generalization of the feedforward backpropagation network. The method is extended to the case of higher order networks and to a constrained dynamical system for training a content addressable memory. The essential feature of the adaptive algorithms is that adaptive equation has a simple outer product form. \n \nPreliminary experiments suggest that learning can occur very rapidly in networks with recurrent connections. The continuous formalism makes the new approach more suitable for implementation in VLSI."

This type of deterministic Boltzmann machine (DBM) learns much faster than the equivalent stochastic Boltzmann machine (SBM), but since the learning procedure for DBM's is only based on an analogy with SBM's, there is no existing proof that it performs gradient descent in any function, and it has only been justified by simulations. By using the appropriate interpretation for the way in which a DBM represents the probability of an output vector given an input vector, it is shown that the DBM performs steepest descent in the same function as the original SBM, except at rare discontinuities. A very simple way of forcing the weights to become symmetrical is also described, and this makes the DBM more biologically plausible than back-propagation (Werbos 1974; Parker 1985; Rumelhart et al. 1986)."

Hence I come forth under the banner of neuromachismo to challenge his assertion that chaotic dynamics is relevant to smell in animals but not yet to speech in humans. Is there such a gulf between olfactive lagomorphs and talking people? What is the difference between a rabbit expressing its love of carrots by rhythmic cheing and sniffing and Prokoviev expressing his love for three oranges in a suite of tones? On the phylogenetic scale these are virtual twins, much as Smolensky's theory and that of Skarda and myself (1985, 1987) are so alike that we can usefully correspond."
