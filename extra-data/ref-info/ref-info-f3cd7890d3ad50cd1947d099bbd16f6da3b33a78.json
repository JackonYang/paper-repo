This approach can lead to incorrect decisions as lower precision features often overwhelm the smaller number of high precision ones. To overcome this problem, we propose a simple coreference architecture based on a sieve that applies tiers of deterministic coreference models one at a time from highest to lowest precision. Each tier builds on the previous tier's entity cluster output. Further, our model propagates global information by sharing attributes (e.g., gender and number) across mentions in the same cluster. This cautious sieve guarantees that stronger features are given precedence over weaker ones and that each decision is made using all of the information available at the time. The framework is highly modular: new coreference modules can be plugged in without any change to the other modules. In spite of its simplicity, our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised models on several standard corpora. This suggests that sieve-based approaches could be applied to other NLP tasks."

These works often show that complex models improve over a weak pairwise baseline. However, less attention has been given to the importance of selecting strong features to support learning a coreference model. \n \nThis paper describes a rather simple pairwise classification model for coreference resolution, developed with a well-designed set of features. We show that this produces a state-of-the-art system that outperforms systems built with complex models. We suggest that our system can be used as a baseline for the development of more complex models -- which may have less impact when a more robust set of features is used. The paper also presents an ablation study and discusses the relative contributions of various features."

The latent tree modeling makes the learning problem computationally feasible because it incorporates a meaningful hidden structure. Additionally, using an automatic feature induction method, we can efficiently build enhanced nonlinear models using linear model learning algorithms. We present empirical results that highlight the contribution of each modeling technique used in the proposed system. Empirical evaluation is performed on the multilingual unrestricted coreference CoNLL-2012 Shared Task datasets, which comprise three languages: Arabic, Chinese and English. We apply the same system to all languages, except for minor adaptations to some language-dependent features such as nested mentions and specific static pronoun lists. A previous version of this system was submitted to the CoNLL-2012 Shared Task closed track, achieving an official score of 58.69, the best among the competitors. The unique enhancement added to the current system version is the inclusion of candidate arcs linking nested mentions for the Chinese language. By including such arcs, the score increases by almost 4.5 points for that language. The current system shows a score of 60.15, which corresponds to a 3.5% error reduction, and is the best performing system for each of the three languages."

Two independent lines of recent research have attempted to improve these mention-pair classifiers, one by learning a mention-ranking model to rank preceding mentions for a given anaphor, and the other by training an entity-mention classifier to determine whether a preceding cluster is coreferent with a given mention. We propose a cluster-ranking approach to coreference resolution that combines the strengths of mention rankers and entity-mention models. We additionally show how our cluster-ranking framework naturally allows discourse-new entity detection to be learned jointly with coreference resolution. Experimental results on the ACE data sets demonstrate its superior performance to competing approaches."

                "text": "This paper introduces a new, unsupervised algorithm for noun phrase coreference resolution. It differs from existing methods in that it views corererence resolution as a clustering task. In an evaluation on the MUC-6 coreference resolution corpus, the algorithm achieves an F-measure of 53.6%~ placing it firmly between the worst (40%) and best (65%) systems in the MUC-6 evaluation. More importantly, the clustering approach outperforms the only MUC-6 system to treat coreference resolution as a learning problem. The clustering algorithm appears to provide a flexible mechanism for coordinating the application of context-independent and context-dependent constraints and preferences for accurate partitioning of noun phrases into coreference equivalence classes. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n Many natural language processing (NLP) applications require accurate noun phrase coreference resolution: They require a means for determining which noun phrases in a text or dialogue refer to the same real-world entity. The vast majority of algorithms for noun phrase coreference combine syntactic and, less often, semantic cues via a set of hand-crafted heuristics and filters. All but one system in the MUC-6 coreference performance evaluation (MUC, 1995), for example, handled coreference resolution in this manner. This same reliance on complicated hand-crafted algorithms is true even for the narrower task of pronoun resolution. Some exceptions exist, however. Ge et al. (1998) present a probabilistic model for pronoun resolution trained on a small subset of the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal corpus (Marcus et al., 1993). Dagan and Itai (1991) develop a statistical filter for resolution of the pronoun \"it\" that selects among syntactically viable antecedents based on relevant subject-verb-object cooccurrences. Aone and Bennett (1995) and McCarthy and Lehnert (1995) employ decision tree algorithms to handle a broader subset of general noun phrase coreference problems. This paper presents a new corpus-based approach to noun phrase coreference. We believe that it is the first such unsupervised technique developed for the general noun phrase coreference task. In short, we view the task of noun phrase coreference resolution as a clustering task. First, each noun phrase in a document is represented as a vector of attribute-value pairs. Given the feature vector for each noun phrase, the clustering algorithm coordinates the application of context-independent and context-dependent coreference constraints and preferences to partition the noun phrases into equivalence classes, one class for each real-world entity mentioned in the text. Context-independent coreference constraints and preferences are those that apply to two noun phrases in isolation. Context-dependent coreference decisions, on the other hand, consider the relationship of each noun phrase to surrounding noun phrases. In an evaluation on the MUC-6 coreference resolution corpus, our clustering approach achieves an F-measure of 53.6%, placing it firmly between the worst (40%) and best (65%) systems in the MUC6 evaluation. More importantly, the clustering approach outperforms the only MUC-6 system to view coreference resolution as a learning problem: The RESOLVE system (McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995) employs decision tree induction and achieves an Fmeasure of 47% on the MUC-6 data set. Furthermore, our approach has a number of important advantages over existing learning and non-learning methods for coreference resolution: \u2022 The approach is largely unsupervised, so no annotated training corpus is required. \u2022 Although evaluated in an information extraction context, the approach is domainindependent. \u2022 As noted above, the clustering approach provides a flexible mechanism for coordinating context-independent and context-dependent coreference constraints and preferences for partitioning noun phrases into coreference equivalence classes."

This is exactly the kind of constraint that integer linear programming (ILP) is ideal for, but, surprisingly, previous work applying ILP to coreference resolution has not encoded this type of constraint. We train a coreference classifier over pairs of mentions, and show how to encode this type of constraint on top of the probabilities output from our pairwise classifier to extract the most probable legal entity assignments. We present results on two commonly used datasets which show that enforcement of transitive closure consistently improves performance, including improvements of up to 3.6% using the b3 scorer, and up to 16.5% using cluster f-measure."

Resources in this field have tended to be limited to noun phrase coreference, often on a restricted set of entities, such as ace entities. OntoNotes provides a large-scale corpus of general anaphoric coreference not restricted to noun phrases or to a specified set of entity types. OntoNotes also provides additional layers of integrated annotation, capturing additional shallow semantic structure. This paper briefly describes the OntoNotes annotation (coreference and other layers) and then describes the parameters of the shared task including the format, pre-processing information, and evaluation criteria, and presents and discusses the results achieved by the participating systems. Having a standard test set and evaluation parameters, all based on a new resource that provides multiple integrated annotation layers (parses, semantic roles, word senses, named entities and coreference) that could support joint models, should help to energize ongoing research in the task of entity and event coreference."

Two independent lines of recent research have attempted to improve these mention-pair classifiers, one by learning amentionranking model to rank preceding mentions for a given anaphor, and the other by training an entity-mention classifier to determine whether a preceding cluster is coreferent with a given mention. We propose a cluster-ranking approach to coreference resolution that combines the strengths of mention rankers and entitymention models. We additionally show how our cluster-ranking framework naturally allows discourse-new entity detection to be learned jointly with coreference resolution.

Our system, however, automatically learns from training data what constitutes an easy decision. Thus, we can utilize more features, learn more precise weights, and adapt to any dataset for which training data is available. Experiments show that our system outperforms recent state-of-the-art coreference systems including Raghunathan et al.\u2019s system as well as a competitive baseline that uses a pairwise classifier."

However, an individual NP usually lacks adequate description information of its referred entity. In this paper, we propose a supervised learning-based approach which does coreference resolution by exploring the relationships between NPs and coreferential clusters. Compared with individual NPs, coreferential clusters could provide richer information of the entities for better rules learning and reference determination. The evaluation done on MEDLINE data set shows that our approach outperforms the baseline NP-NP based approach in both recall and precision."

Yet prior attempts to resolve opaque pairs using ontologies or distributional semantics hurt precision more than improved recall. We present a new unsupervised method for mining opaque pairs. Our intuition is to restrict distributional semantics to articles about the same event, thus promoting referential match. Using an English comparable corpus of tech news, we built a dictionary of opaque coreferent mentions (only 3% are in WordNet). Our dictionary can be integrated into any coreference system (it increases the performance of a state-of-the-art system by 1% F1 on all measures) and is easily extendable by using news aggregators."

We introduce the newly added constraints and sieves and discuss the improvement on the original system.

In contrast to much current work, which focuses on learning and on the discourse component, our system is deterministic and is driven entirely by syntactic and semantic compatibility as learned from a large, unlabeled corpus. Despite its simplicity and discourse naivete, our system substantially outperforms all unsupervised systems and most supervised ones. Primary contributions include (1) the presentation of a simple-to-reproduce, high-performing baseline and (2) the demonstration that most remaining errors can be attributed to syntactic and semantic factors external to the coreference phenomenon (and perhaps best addressed by non-coreference systems)."

We outline a set of approximations that make this approach practical, and apply our method to the ACE coreference dataset, achieving a 45% error reduction over a comparable method that only considers features of pairs of noun phrases. This result demonstrates an example of how a firstorder logic representation can be incorporated into a probabilistic model and scaled efficiently."

The metric is computed by aligning reference and system entities (or coreference chains) with the constraint that a system (reference) entity is aligned with at most one reference (system) entity. We show that the best alignment is a maximum bipartite matching problem which can be solved by the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm. Comparative experiments are conducted to show that the widely-known MUC F-measure has serious flaws in evaluating a coreference system. The proposed metric is also compared with the ACE-Value, the official evaluation metric in the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) task, and we conclude that the proposed metric possesses some properties such as symmetry and better interpretability missing in the ACE-Value."

It was a follow-on to the English-only task organized in 2011. Until the creation of the OntoNotes corpus, resources in this subfield of language processing have tended to be limited to noun phrase coreference, often on a restricted set of entities, such as ACE entities. OntoNotes provides a large-scale corpus of general anaphoric coreference not restricted to noun phrases or to a specified set of entity types and covering multiple languages. OntoNotes also provides additional layers of integrated annotation, capturing additional shallow semantic structure. This paper briefly describes the OntoNotes annotation (coreference and other layers) and then describes the parameters of the shared task including the format, pre-processing information, evaluation criteria, and presents and discusses the results achieved by the participating systems. Being a task that has a complex evaluation history, and multiple evalation conditions, it has, in the past, been difficult to judge the improvement in new algorithms over previously reported results. Having a standard test set and evaluation parameters, all based on a resource that provides multiple integrated annotation layers (parses, semantic roles, word senses, named entities and coreference) that could support joint models, should help to energize ongoing research in the task of entity and event coreference."

We extract semantic compatibility and aliasing information from Wikipedia and Yago, and incorporate it into a CR system. We show that using such knowledge with no disambiguation and filtering does not bring any improvement over the baseline, mirroring the previous findings. We propose, therefore, a number of solutions to reduce the amount of noise coming from web resources: using disambiguation tools for Wikipedia, pruning Yago to eliminate the most generic categories and imposing additional constraints on affected mentions. Our evaluation experiments on the ACE-02 corpus show that the knowledge, extracted from Wikipedia and Yago, improves our system's performance by 2-3 percentage points."

We participate in the closed track for English and Chinese, and also submit an open result for Chinese using tools to generate the required features. Finally, we reach the average F1 scores 58.68, 60.69 and 61.02 on the English closed task, Chinese closed and open tasks."

Like NE tagging and coreference resolution, most solutions to the EDT task separate out the mention detection aspect from the coreference aspect. By doing so, these solutions are limited to using only local features for learning. In contrast, by modeling both aspects of the EDT task simultaneously, we are able to learn using highly complex, non-local features. We develop a new joint EDT model and explore the utility of many features, demonstrating their effectiveness on this task."

The approach learns from a small, annotated corpus and the task includes resolving not just a certain type of noun phrase (e.g., pronouns) but rather general noun phrases. It also does not restrict the entity types of the noun phrases; that is, coreference is assigned whether they are of organization, person, or other types. We evaluate our approach on common data sets (namely, the MUC-6 and MUC-7 coreference corpora) and obtain encouraging results, indicating that on the general noun phrase coreference task, the learning approach holds promise and achieves accuracy comparable to that of nonlearning approaches. Our system is the first learning-based system that offers performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art nonlearning systems on these data sets."

Unlike many historical approaches to coreference, the models presented here are relational\u2014they do not assume that pairwise coreference decisions should be made independently from each other. Unlike other relational models of coreference that are generative, the conditional model here can incorporate a great variety of features of the input without having to be concerned about their dependencies\u2014paralleling the advantages of conditional random fields over hidden Markov models.

For a given anaphor and all the preceding referring expressions as the antecedent candidates, a common constraint agent is first presented to filter out invalid antecedent candidates using various kinds of general knowledge. Then, according to the type of the anaphor, a special constraint agent is proposed to filter out more invalid antecedent candidates using constraints which are derived from various kinds of special knowledge. Finally, a simple preference agent is used to choose an antecedent for the anaphor form the remaining antecedent candidates, based on the proximity principle. One interesting observation is that the most recent antecedent of an anaphor in the coreferential chain is sometimes indirectly linked to the anaphor via some other antecedents in the chain. In this case, we find that the most recent antecedent always contains little information to directly determine the coreference relationship with the anaphor. Therefore, for a given anaphor, the corresponding special constraint agent can always safely filter out these less informative antecedent candidates.

Our iterative method cautiously constructs clusters of entity and event mentions using linear regression to model cluster merge operations. As clusters are built, information flows between entity and event clusters through features that model semantic role dependencies. Our system handles nominal and verbal events as well as entities, and our joint formulation allows information from event coreference to help entity coreference, and vice versa. In a cross-document domain with comparable documents, joint coreference resolution performs significantly better (over 3 CoNLL F1 points) than two strong baselines that resolve entities and events separately."

Some unsupervised approaches have been proposed (e.g., Haghighi and Klein (2007)), but they are less accurate. In this paper, we present the first unsupervised approach that is competitive with supervised ones. This is made possible by performing joint inference across mentions, in contrast to the pairwise classification typically used in supervised methods, and by using Markov logic as a representation language, which enables us to easily express relations like apposition and predicate nominals. On MUC and ACE datasets, our model outperforms Haghigi and Klein's one using only a fraction of the training data, and often matches or exceeds the accuracy of state-of-the-art supervised models."

The proposed latent tree modeling turns the learning problem computationally feasible. Additionally, using an automatic feature induction method, we are able to efficiently build nonlinear models and, hence, achieve high performances with a linear learning algorithm. Our system is evaluated on the CoNLL-2012 Shared Task closed track, which comprises three languages: Arabic, Chinese and English. We apply the same system to all languages, except for minor adaptations on some language dependent features, like static lists of pronouns. Our system achieves an official score of 58.69, the best one among all the competitors."

While rule-based systems are appealing due to their well-known \"explainability,\" most, if not all, state-of-the-art results for NER tasks are based on machine learning techniques. Motivated by these results, we explore the following natural question in this paper: Are rule-based systems still a viable approach to named-entity recognition? Specifically, we have designed and implemented a high-level language NERL on top of SystemT, a general-purpose algebraic information extraction system. NERL is tuned to the needs of NER tasks and simplifies the process of building, understanding, and customizing complex rule-based named-entity annotators. We show that these customized annotators match or outperform the best published results achieved with machine learning techniques. These results confirm that we can reap the benefits of rule-based extractors' explainability without sacrificing accuracy. We conclude by discussing lessons learned while building and customizing complex rule-based annotators and outlining several research directions towards facilitating rule development."

None of them is fully adequate, and their measures are not commensurate. We enumerate the desiderata for a coreference scoring measure, discuss the strong and weak points of the existing measures, and propose the BiLateral Assessment of Noun-Phrase Coreference, a variation of the Rand index created to suit the coreference task. The BiLateral Assessment of Noun-Phrase Coreference rewards both coreference and non-coreference links by averaging the F-scores of the two types, does not ignore singletons \u2013 the main problem with the MUC score \u2013 and does not inflate the score in their presence \u2013 a problem with the B3 and CEAF scores. In addition, its fine granularity is consistent over the whole range of scores and affords better discrimination between systems."

It is suggested that the system is resolving a sub-set of anaphors that do not require general world knowledge or sophisticated linguistic processing for successful resolution. The system does this by being very sensitive to ambiguity, and only resolving pronouns when very high confidence rules have been satisfied. The system is capable of 'noticing' ambiguity because it requires that there be a unique antecedent within a salience ranking, and the salience rankings are not total orders, i.e. two or more antecedents can be equally salient. Given the nature of the systems rules, it is very likely that they are largely domain independent and that they reflect processing strategies used by humans for general language comprehension. The system has been evaluated in two distinct experiments which support the overall validity of the approach."

We show that word associations are useful for CoRe -- e.g., the strong association between Obama and President is an indicator of likely coreference. Association information has so far not been used in CoRe because it is sparse and difficult to learn from small labeled corpora. Since unlabeled text is readily available, our unsupervised approach addresses the sparseness problem. In a self-training framework, we train a decision tree on a corpus that is automatically labeled using word associations. We show that this unsupervised system has better CoRe performance than other learning approaches that do not use manually labeled data."

To obtain this semantic information, corpusbased approaches commonly leverage patterns that can express a specific semantic relation.

To deal with this problem, in this paper we propose an approach that can automatically find the effective patterns for coreference resolution. We explore how to automatically discover and evaluate patterns, and how to exploit the patterns to obtain the semantic relatedness information. The evaluation on ACE data set shows that the pattern based semantic information is helpful for coreference resolution."

Through a simple bootstrapping procedure, we learn the likelihood of coreference between a pronoun and a candidate noun based on the path in the parse tree between the two entities. This path information enables us to handle previously challenging resolution instances, and also robustly addresses traditional syntactic coreference constraints. Highly coreferent paths also allow mining of precise probabilistic gender/number information. We combine statistical knowledge with well known features in a Support Vector Machine pronoun resolution classifier. Significant gains in performance are observed on several datasets."

By varying separately three parameters (language, annotation scheme, and preprocessing information) and applying the same coreference resolution system, the strong bonds between system and corpus are demonstrated. The experiments reveal problems in coreference resolution evaluation relating to task definition, coding schemes, and features. They also expose systematic biases in the coreference evaluation metrics. We show that system comparison is only possible when corpus parameters are in exact agreement."

The inclusion of such detectors was motivated by the observation that more than 50% of definite descriptions ( DDs) in an average corpus are discourse new (Poesio and Vieira, 1998), but whereas the inclusion of detectors for non-anaphoric pronouns in algorithms such as Lappin and Leass\u2019 (1994) leads to clear improvements in precision, the improvements in anaphoric DD resolution (as opposed to classification) brought about by the detectors were rather small. In fact, Ng and Cardie (2002a) challenged the motivation for the inclusion of such detectors, reporting no improvements, or even worse performance. We re-examine the literature on the topic in detail, and propose a revised algorithm, taking advantage of the improved discourse-new detection techniques developed by Uryupina (2003)."

The algorithm applies to the syntactic representations generated by McCord's Slot Grammar parser and relies on salience measures derived from syntactic structure and a simple dynamic model of attentional state. Like the parser, the algorithm is implemented in Prolog. The authors have tested it extensively on computer manual texts and conducted a blind test on manual text containing 360 pronoun occurrences. The algorithm successfully identifies the antecedent of the pronoun for 86% of these pronoun occurrences. The relative contributions of the algorithm's components to its overall success rate in this blind test are examined. Experiments were conducted with an enhancement of the algorithm that contributes statistically modelled information concerning semantic and real-world relations to the algorithm's decision procedure. Interestingly, this enhancement only marginally improves the algorithm's performance (by 2%). The algorithm is compared with other approaches to anaphora resolution that have been proposed in the literature. In particular, the search procedure of Hobbs' algorithm was implemented in the Slot Grammar framework and applied to the sentences in teh blind test set. The authors' algorithm achieves a higher rate of success (4%) than Hobbs' algorithm. The relation of the algorithm to the centering approach is discussed, as well as to models of anaphora resolution that invoke a variety of informational factors in ranking antecedent candidates."

We propose an extension to these states which handles some additional cases of multiple ambiguous pronouns.

The first, Baby Steps, bootstraps itself via iterated learning of increasingly longer sentences and requires no initialization. This method substantially exceeds Klein and Manning's published scores and achieves 39.4% accuracy on Section 23 (all sentences) of the Wall Street Journal corpus. The second, Less is More, uses a low-complexity subset of the available data: sentences up to length 15. Focusing on fewer but simpler examples trades off quantity against ambiguity; it attains 44.1% accuracy, using the standard linguistically-informed prior and batch training, beating state-of-the-art. Leapfrog, our third heuristic, combines Less is More with Baby Steps by mixing their models of shorter sentences, then rapidly ramping up exposure to the full training set, driving up accuracy to 45.0%. These trends generalize to the Brown corpus; awareness of data complexity may improve other parsing models and unsupervised algorithms."

We show how to solve this dilemma with Gibbs sampling, a simple Monte Carlo method used to perform approximate inference in factored probabilistic models. By using simulated annealing in place of Viterbi decoding in sequence models such as HMMs, CMMs, and CRFs, it is possible to incorporate non-local structure while preserving tractable inference. We use this technique to augment an existing CRF-based information extraction system with long-distance dependency models, enforcing label consistency and extraction template consistency constraints. This technique results in an error reduction of up to 9% over state-of-the-art systems on two established information extraction tasks."

In particular, this problem arises in industrial systems that are aimed at providing goods and services. One of the major approaches to this problem is that a set of potential answers that were obtained using a keyword search is repeatedly ordered by comparing syntactic answer parse trees with a question parse tree. This work modifies the approach based on using parse trees and improves it by passing to a more exact representation of semantic and syntactic text structure: the consideration of text paragraphs as a unit of analyzed information. The software implementation of the approach was performed and the results of the implementation were placed in open access as an adjustment for the Apache SOLR search engine, by which the suggested technology can be easily integrated with industrial search systems."

It continues with a chapter on evaluation and one on the comparison of different methods, and it closes with a few words on current trends and future prospects of dependency parsing.

I will give an overview of the field of dependency parsing while giving my aims for future research. Many NLP applications rely heavily on the quality of dependency parsing.

Stochastic language models fit rather well the uncertainty created by the acoustic pattern matching. These models are used to score theories corresponding to partial interpretations of sentences. Algorithms have been developed to compute probabilities for theories that grow in a strictly left-to-right fash\u00ad ion. In this paper we consider new relations to compute probabilities of partial interpretations of sentences . We introduce theories containing a gap corresponding to an uninterpreted signal segment. Algorithms can be easily obtained from these re\u00ad lations. CoIIJ.putational complexity of these algo\u00ad rithms is also derived."

A large number of rules is needed for coverage of the domain, suggesting that a fairly large number of labeled examples should be required to train a classifier. However, we show that the use of unlabeled data can reduce the requirements for supervision to just 7 simple \"seed\" rules. The approach gains leverage from natural redundancy in the data: for many named-entity instances both the spelling of the name and the context inwhich it appears are sufficient to determine its type. We present two algorithms. The first method uses a similar algorithm to that of (Yarowsky 95), with modifications motivated by (Blum and Mitchell 98). The second algorithm extends ideas from boosting algorithms, designed for supervised learning tasks, to the framework suggested by (Blum and Mitchell 98)."

We consider the underlying design principles of the Stanford scheme from this perspective, and compare it to the GR and PARC representations.

Yet its data quality is compromised as most of existing quality assessment approaches rely mainly on the syntax or lexicon, rather than the semantics. We propose a Fact-based Quality Assessment (FQA) approach, which captures the data quality based on content semantics by gleaning the Web community knowledge. The FQA can automatically rank the Web data quality in terms of the three most important quality dimensions accuracy, completeness and freshness. Furthermore, the semantic dimensions can well complement existing works based on syntactical or lexical features. Given one source article, the FQA starts with the identification of an alternative context by collecting articles of the same topics. Then, the dimension baselines of accuracy, completeness and freshness are extracted in the alternative context. Finally, the data quality is determined by comparing the semantic corpus of the source article with the established dimension baselines. The performance of our FQA is verified in the experiments."

Indeed, its performance of 86.36% (LP/LR F1) is better than that of early lexicalized PCFG models, and surprisingly close to the current state-of-the-art. This result has potential uses beyond establishing a strong lower bound on the maximum possible accuracy of unlexicalized models: an unlexicalized PCFG is much more compact, easier to replicate, and easier to interpret than more complex lexical models, and the parsing algorithms are simpler, more widely understood, of lower asymptotic complexity, and easier to optimize."

All of these features are supported by a technique of input reliability evaluation. Particular attention is devoted to the description of the knowledge internal representation and of the mechanism that manages, at different points of the anlysis, the whole process."

                "text": "The objective of the ACE program is to develop technology to automatically infer from human language data the entities being mentioned, the relations among these entities that are directly expressed, and the events in which these entities participate. Data sources include audio and image data in addition to pure text, and Arabic and Chinese in addition to English. The effort involves defining the research tasks in detail, collecting and annotating data needed for training, development, and evaluation, and supporting the research with evaluation tools and research workshops. This program began with a pilot study in 1999. The next evaluation is scheduled for September 2004. Introduction and Background Today\u2019s global web of electronic information, including most notably the www, provides a resource of unbounded information-bearing potential. But to fully exploit this potential requires the ability to extract content from human language automatically. That is the objective of the ACE program \u2013 to develop the capability to extract meaning from multimedia sources. These sources include text, audio and image data. The ACE program is a \u201ctechnocentric\u201d research effort, meaning that the emphasis is on developing core enabling technologies rather than solving the application needs that motivate the research. The program began in 1999 with a study intended to identify those key content extraction tasks to serve as the research targets for the remainder of the program. These tasks were identified in general as the extraction of the entities, relations and events being discussed in the language. In general objective, the ACE program is motivated by and addresses the same issues as the MUC program that preceded it (NIST 1999). The ACE program, however, attempts to take the task \u201coff the page\u201d in the sense that the research objectives are defined in terms of the target objects (i.e., the entities, the relations, and the events) rather than in terms of the words in the text. For example, the so-called \u201cnamed entity\u201d task, as defined in MUC, is to identify those words (on the page) that are names of entities. In ACE, on the other hand, the corresponding task is to identify the entity so named. This is a different task, one that is more abstract and that involves inference more explicitly in producing an answer. In a real sense, the task is to detect things that \u201caren\u2019t there\u201d. Reference resolution thus becomes an integral and critical part of solving the problem. During the period 2000-2001, the ACE effort was devoted solely to entity detection and tracking. During the period 2002-2003, relations were explored and added. 1 While the ACE program is directed toward extraction of information from audio and image sources in addition to pure text, the research effort is restricted to information extraction from text. The actual transduction of audio and image data into text is not part of the ACE research effort, although the processing of ASR and OCR output from such transducers is. Now, starting in 2004, events are being explored and added as the third of the three original tasks."

We define a concept of word-by-word alignment between such pairs of sentences. For any given pair of such sentences each of our models assigns a probability to each of the possible word-by-word alignments. We give an algorithm for seeking the most probable of these alignments. Although the algorithm is suboptimal, the alignment thus obtained accounts well for the word-by-word relationships in the pair of sentences. We have a great deal of data in French and English from the proceedings of the Canadian Parliament. Accordingly, we have restricted our work to these two languages; but we feel that because our algorithms have minimal linguistic content they would work well on other pairs of languages. We also feel, again because of the minimal linguistic content of our algorithms, that it is reasonable to argue that word-by-word alignments are inherent in any sufficiently large bilingual corpus."

The selected informative pairs are then used to detect person mentions from raw texts in an unsupervised learning framework. Experiments showed that this approach can achieve high performance comparable to state-of-the-art supervised learning methods which require manually annotated corpora and gazetteers."

The list includes: Mrs. Ludwig for third through sixth grade, Mr. Parsons for seventh through ninth grade, Jay Aravind Joshi. Its nice to think that something came of all the effort these people have put my way. I fortunately had the pleasure of several friends unrelated Penn who entertained me at key points, bolstered waining self-esteem, and just plain dragged me away from my dissertation. They easily added a year to the amount of time it took me to finish-but I still have a head of hair and am only half grey due to their influence. In no particular order, Keith Larson who does a simply dazzling \"drop everything, its time to go to the beach\", Erica Fletcher who is the only genuine Witch that I know of, Michael McLintock who dragged me bodily to West Virginia for white water trips, Dalran Lindsey iii who made it his business that I should know more about fine wine than I do about discourse processing, Rosemary Rau who badgered me for a year and a half as to whether I could be called \"Doctor of Philosophy\" yet, Luca Bogoni who runs for the door at the sound of hand cuffs, Jim Gee who has perfect hair, and Gareth Funka-Lea who continually reminds me of the fact that it is very nice to have the company of smart friends-but that it is better with good wine."

Going beyond these coarse measures of gender participation, we conduct a fine-grained study of gender in the field of Natural Language Processing. We use topic models (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to explore the research topics of men and women in the ACL Anthology Network. We find that women publish more on dialog, discourse, and sentiment, while men publish more than women in parsing, formal semantics, and finite state models. To conduct our study we labeled the gender of authors in the ACL Anthology mostly manually, creating a useful resource for other gender studies. Finally, our study of historical patterns in female participation shows that the proportion of women authors in computational linguistics has been continuously increasing, with approximately a 50% increase in the three decades since 1980."

This paper describes a computational grammar coder which has been completely programmed and is oper~tional on Lhe IBM 7090. It is part of a complete syntactic annlysis system for which it accomplishes word-class coding, using a computational approach rather than the usual method of dictionary lookup. The resulting system is completely contained in less than 1~,000 computer words. It processes running English text on the IBM 7090 at a rate of more than 1250 words per minute. Since the system is not dependent on large dictionaries, it operates on any ordinary English text. In preliminary experiments with scientific text, the system correctly and unambiguously coded over 90 percent of the words in two samples of scientific writing. A fair proportion of the remaining ambiguity can be removed at higher levels of synvactic analysis, but the problem of structural ambiguity in natural languages is seen to be a critical one in the development of practical language processing systems."

These criteria depend on a measure of similarity between two different clusterings of the same set of data; the measure essentially considers how each pair of data points is assigned in each clustering."
