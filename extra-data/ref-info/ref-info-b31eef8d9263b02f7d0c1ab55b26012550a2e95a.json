Existing methods for extracting relations from the DOM trees of semi-structured webpages can achieve high precision and recall only when manual annotations for each website are available. Although there have been efforts to learn extractors from automatically-generated labels, these methods are not sufficiently robust to succeed in settings with complex schemas and information-rich websites. \nIn this paper we present a new method for automatic extraction from semi-structured websites based on distant supervision. We automatically generate training labels by aligning an existing knowledge base with a web page and leveraging the unique structural characteristics of semi-structured websites. We then train a classifier based on the potentially noisy and incomplete labels to predict new relation instances. Our method can compete with annotation-based techniques in the literature in terms of extraction quality. A large-scale experiment on over 400,000 pages from dozens of multi-lingual long-tail websites harvested 1.25 million facts at a precision of 90%."

Open IE systems such as TextRunner, on the other hand, aim to handle the unbounded number of relations found on the Web. But how well can these open systems perform? \n \nThis paper presents WOE, an open IE system which improves dramatically on TextRunner's precision and recall. The key to WOE's performance is a novel form of self-supervised learning for open extractors -- using heuristic matches between Wikipedia infobox attribute values and corresponding sentences to construct training data. Like TextRunner, WOE's extractor eschews lexicalized features and handles an unbounded set of semantic relations. WOE can operate in two modes: when restricted to POS tag features, it runs as quickly as TextRunner, but when set to use dependency-parse features its precision and recall rise even higher."

                "text": "Traditionally, Information Extraction (IE) has focused on satisfying precise, narrow, pre-specified requests from small homogeneous corpora (e.g., extract the location and time of seminars from a set of announcements). Shifting to a new domain requires the user to name the target relations and to manually create new extraction rules or hand-tag new training examples. This manual labor scales linearly with the number of target relations. This paper introduces Open IE (OIE), a new extraction paradigm where the system makes a single data-driven pass over its corpus and extracts a large set of relational tuples without requiring any human input. The paper also introduces TEXTRUNNER, a fully implemented, highly scalable OIE system where the tuples are assigned a probability and indexed to support efficient extraction and exploration via user queries. We report on experiments over a 9,000,000 Web page corpus that compare TEXTRUNNER with KNOWITALL, a state-of-the-art Web IE system. TEXTRUNNER achieves an error reduction of 33% on a comparable set of extractions. Furthermore, in the amount of time it takes KNOWITALL to perform extraction for a handful of pre-specified relations, TEXTRUNNER extracts a far broader set of facts reflecting orders of magnitude more relations, discovered on the fly. We report statistics on TEXTRUNNER\u2019s 11,000,000 highest probability tuples, and show that they contain over 1,000,000 concrete facts and over 6,500,000more abstract assertions."

We also develop a bi-LSTM transducer, extending recent deep Semantic Role Labeling models to extract Open IE tuples and provide confidence scores for tuning their precision-recall tradeoff. Furthermore, we show that the recently released Question-Answer Meaning Representation dataset can be automatically converted into an Open IE corpus which significantly increases the amount of available training data. Our supervised model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art Open IE systems on benchmark datasets."

However, state-of-the-art Open IE systems such as ReVerb and woe share two important weaknesses -- (1) they extract only relations that are mediated by verbs, and (2) they ignore context, thus extracting tuples that are not asserted as factual. This paper presents ollie, a substantially improved Open IE system that addresses both these limitations. First, ollie achieves high yield by extracting relations mediated by nouns, adjectives, and more. Second, a context-analysis step increases precision by including contextual information from the sentence in the extractions. ollie obtains 2.7 times the area under precision-yield curve (AUC) compared to ReVerb and 1.9 times the AUC of woeparse."

This paper shows that the output of state-of-the-art Open IE systems is rife with uninformative and incoherent extractions. To overcome these problems, we introduce two simple syntactic and lexical constraints on binary relations expressed by verbs. We implemented the constraints in the ReVerb Open IE system, which more than doubles the area under the precision-recall curve relative to previous extractors such as TextRunner and woepos. More than 30% of ReVerb's extractions are at precision 0.8 or higher---compared to virtually none for earlier systems. The paper concludes with a detailed analysis of ReVerb's errors, suggesting directions for future work."

To efficiently extract structured data from enormous websites in various verticals (e.g., books, restaurants), much research effort has been attracted, but most existing approaches either require considerable human effort or rely on strong features that lack of flexibility. We consider an ambitious scenario -- can we build a system that (1) is general enough to handle any vertical without re-implementation and (2) requires only one labeled example site from each vertical for training to automatically deal with other sites in the same vertical? In this paper, we propose a unified solution to demonstrate the feasibility of this scenario. Specifically, we design a set of weak but general features to characterize vertical knowledge (including attribute-specific semantics and inter-attribute layout relationships). Such features can be adopted in various verticals without redesign; meanwhile, they are weak enough to avoid overfitting of the learnt knowledge to seed sites. Given a new unseen site, the learnt knowledge is first applied to identify page-level candidate attribute values, while inevitably involve false positives. To remove noise, site-level information of the new site is then exploited to boost up the true values. The site-level information is derived in an unsupervised manner, without harm to the applicability of the solution. Promising experimental performance on 80 websites in 8 distinct verticals demonstrated the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed solution."

LODIE aims to develop information extraction techniques able to scale at web level and adapt to user information needs. The core idea behind LODIE is the usage of linked open data, a very large-scale information resource, as a ground-breaking solution for IE, which provides invaluable annotated data on a growing number of domains.

To increase the scale even further, we need to explore automatic methods for constructing knowledge bases. Previous approaches have primarily focused on text-based extraction, which can be very noisy. Here we introduce Knowledge Vault, a Web-scale probabilistic knowledge base that combines extractions from Web content (obtained via analysis of text, tabular data, page structure, and human annotations) with prior knowledge derived from existing knowledge repositories. We employ supervised machine learning methods for fusing these distinct information sources. The Knowledge Vault is substantially bigger than any previously published structured knowledge repository, and features a probabilistic inference system that computes calibrated probabilities of fact correctness. We report the results of multiple studies that explore the relative utility of the different information sources and extraction methods."

Automatic extraction of structured data at the scale of thousands of websites has long proven elusive, despite its central role in the \"web of data\". \n \nThrough an extensive evaluation spanning over 10000 web sites from multiple application domains, we show that automatic, yet accurate full-site extraction is no longer a distant dream. diadem is the first automatic full-site extraction system that is able to extract structured data from different domains at very high accuracy. It combines automated exploration of websites, identification of relevant data, and induction of exhaustive wrappers. Automating these components is the first challenge. diadem overcomes this challenge by combining phenomenological and ontological knowledge. Integrating these components is the second challenge. diadem overcomes this challenge through a self-adaptive network of relational transducers that produces effective wrappers for a wide variety of websites. \n \nOur extensive and publicly available evaluation shows that, for more than 90% of sites from three domains, diadem obtains an effective wrapper that extracts all relevant data with 97% average precision. diadem also tolerates noisy entity recognisers, and its components individually outperform comparable approaches."

We extracted 14.1 billion HTML tables from Google's general-purpose web crawl, and used statistical classification techniques to find the estimated 154M that contain high-quality relational data. Because each relational table has its own \"schema\" of labeled and typed columns, each such table can be considered a small structured database. The resulting corpus of databases is larger than any other corpus we are aware of, by at least five orders of magnitude. \n \nWe describe the WEBTABLES system to explore two fundamental questions about this collection of databases. First, what are effective techniques for searching for structured data at search-engine scales? Second, what additional power can be derived by analyzing such a huge corpus? \n \nFirst, we develop new techniques for keyword search over a corpus of tables, and show that they can achieve substantially higher relevance than solutions based on a traditional search engine. Second, we introduce a new object derived from the database corpus: the attribute correlation statistics database (AcsDB) that records corpus-wide statistics on co-occurrences of schema elements. In addition to improving search relevance, the AcsDB makes possible several novel applications: schema auto-complete, which helps a database designer to choose schema elements; attribute synonym finding, which automatically computes attribute synonym pairs for schema matching; and join-graph traversal, which allows a user to navigate between extracted schemas using automatically-generated join links."

Our proposal comes within a formal framework tackling two problems: the data extraction problem, to generate extraction rules based on the input websites, and the data integration problem, to integrate the extracted data in a unified schema. We introduce an original algorithm, WEIR, to solve the stated problems and formally prove its correctness. WEIR leverages the overlapping data among sources to make better decisions both in the data extraction (by pruning rules that do not lead to redundant information) and in the data integration (by reflecting local properties of a source over the mediated schema). Along the way, we characterize the amount of redundancy needed by our algorithm to produce a solution, and present experimental results to show the benefits of our approach with respect to existing solutions."

Our parser is an encoder-decoder neural network with two key technical innovations: (1) a grammar for the decoder that only generates well-typed logical forms; and (2) an entity embedding and linking module that identifies entity mentions while generalizing across tables. We also introduce a novel method for training our neural model with question-answer supervision. On the WikiTableQuestions data set, our parser achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 43.3% for a single model and 45.9% for a 5-model ensemble, improving on the best prior score of 38.7% set by a 15-model ensemble. These results suggest that type constraints and entity linking are valuable components to incorporate in neural semantic parsers."

While existing work trades off one aspect for another, this paper simultaneously makes progress on both fronts through a new task: answering complex questions on semi-structured tables using question-answer pairs as supervision. The central challenge arises from two compounding factors: the broader domain results in an open-ended set of relations, and the deeper compositionality results in a combinatorial explosion in the space of logical forms. We propose a logical-form driven parsing algorithm guided by strong typing constraints and show that it obtains significant improvements over natural baselines. For evaluation, we created a new dataset of 22,033 complex questions on Wikipedia tables, which is made publicly available."

Since then, our work has been motivated by applying WebTables in a broad set of applications at Google, resulting in several product launches. In this paper, we describe the challenges faced, lessons learned, and new insights that we gained from our eorts. The main challenges we faced in our eorts were (1) identifying tables that are likely to contain high-quality data (as opposed to tables used for navigation, layout, or formatting), and (2) recovering the semantics of these tables or signals that hint at their semantics. The result is a semantically enriched table corpus that we used to develop several services. First, we created a search engine for structured data whose index includes over a hundred million HTML tables. Second, we enabled users of Google Docs (through its Research Panel) to nd relevant data tables and to insert such data into their documents as needed. Most recently, we brought WebTables to a much broader audience by using the table corpus to provide richer tabular snippets for fact-seeking web search queries on Google.com."

By removing the site-level supervision that wrapper-based techniques require, we are able to perform information extraction at web-scale, with accuracy unattained with existing unsupervised extraction techniques. Our system is used in production at Yahoo! and powers live applications."

The past decade has seen a flurry of research and commercial activities around the WebTables project itself, as well as the broad topic of informal online structured data. In this paper, we will review the WebTables project, and try to place it in the broader context of the decade of work that followed. We will also show how the progress over the past ten years sets up an exciting agenda for the future, and will draw upon many corners of the data management community.

Popular models that learn such representations ignore the morphology of words, by assigning a distinct vector to each word. This is a limitation, especially for languages with large vocabularies and many rare words. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the skipgram model, where each word is represented as a bag of character n-grams. A vector representation is associated to each character n-gram; words being represented as the sum of these representations. Our method is fast, allowing to train models on large corpora quickly and allows us to compute word representations for words that did not appear in the training data. We evaluate our word representations on nine different languages, both on word similarity and analogy tasks. By comparing to recently proposed morphological word representations, we show that our vectors achieve state-of-the-art performance on these tasks."
