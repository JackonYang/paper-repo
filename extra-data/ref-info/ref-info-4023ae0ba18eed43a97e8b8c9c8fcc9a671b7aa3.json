The rapid increase in the amount of published experimental work has made all such books out of date, and the teacher of experimental psychology has been forced to use seriously incomplete text-books and to supplement them in his teaching by his own knowledge of the technical journals. The task of making a single volume representive of the present position of experimental psychology seemed too laborious for accomplishment. This, however, has now been done by Prof. R. S. Woodworth, and his book will be welcomed by all students of the subject.Experimental PsychologyBy Robert S. Woodworth. Pp. xi + 889. (London: Methuen and Co., Ltd., 1938.) 18s. net."

Suppose further that for some reason we cannot count the number of objects in either group. Still, some property of each group makes it possible for a person to say that one of these groups is greater-than, lessthan, or equal-to the other group. It is this property of a collection of objects that we define as numerousness.l We might say that numerousness is that property of a group of objects which we can discriminate, without counting, under instruction to judge how many objects the group contains. We shall wish to modify this definition later as a result of the experiments reported in this paper, but it is adequate for the present discussion of the problem. The judgment of 'numerousness' may be made in several different ways: (a) it may be comparative-more numerous or less numerous, larger or smaller, etc.; (b) or it may be 'absolute.' There is one special form that the absolute judgment of numerousness can take. It is called the direct reporting of number. In this method of reporting, a numeral is assigned to represent how many things there are in any given collection of objects. After a brief look-so brief that counting is impossible-we say 10, 23, or 250 to indicate that we estimate that the group contained 10, 23, or 250 members."

Muller, F. Wulf, and J. J. Gibson 8 have pointed out various factors which are important in bringing about the changes that occur in reproduced forms when they are compared with the forms as originally presented. In the present study an effort has been made to control by experimental means the nature of the change in form. The directive agency used was language, or, more precisely, those processes of the organism that are initiated by language. Historically, Muller treats of the changes that take place after the passage of time in the reproduction of perceived forms in terms which include such concepts as 'convergence' or 'blurring' of the characteristic features of patterns. F. Wulf criticizes this view and proposes, on the basis of experimental study, to describe the observed changes in terms of such specific tendencies as 'sharpening,' 'levelling' and what may be termed the 'equilibrium tendency' in the structure. He remarks, however, that in some instances his subjects spontaneously identified the presented forms with 1 Muller, G. E., Zur Analyse der GedachtnistStigkeit und dee Vorstellungsverlaufes, III.

With noise or low\u2010pass filtering the confusions fall into consistent patterns, but with high\u2010pass filtering the errors are scattered quite randomly. An articulatory analysis of these 16 consonants provides a system of five articulatory features or \u201cdimensions\u201d that serve to characterize and distinguish the different phonemes: voicing, nasality, affrication, duration, and place of articulation. The data indicate that voicing and nasality are little affected and that place is severely affected by low\u2010pass and noisy systems. The indications are that the perception of any one of these five features is relatively independent of the perception of the others, so that it is as if five separate, simple channels were involved rather tha..."

Matches were made to these standards from an assortment of 342 heterogeneous colors arranged in a display which presented 171 of them simultaneously. The viewing conditions approximate those found in certain complex display situations. Twenty subjects were used in the experiment. Each subject was required to indicate those colors on the display board which provided satisfactory matches for each of the standard colors. Contours on the CIE diagram are drawn to show the percentage of times various chromaticities were confused. From these contours we have selected colors which can be discriminated with high levels of accuracy and so are suitable for coding qualitative and quantitative information. In general, the contours follow trends suggested by extrapolation from precise threshold data."
