The collected database consists of 419 flowcharts labeled at the stroke and symbol levels. In addition, an isolated database of graphical and text symbols was extracted from these collected flowcharts. Then, we tackle the problem of online handwritten flowchart recognition from two different points of view. Firstly, we consider that flowcharts are correctly segmented, and we propose different classifiers to perform two tasks, text/non-text separation and graphical symbol recognition. Tested with the extracted isolated test database, we achieve up to 90% and 98% in text/non-text separation and up to 93.5% in graphical symbols recognition. Secondly, we propose a global approach to perform flowchart segmentation and recognition. For this latter, we adopt a global learning schema and a recognition architecture that considers a simultaneous segmentation and recognition. Global architecture is trained and tested directly with flowcharts. Results show the interest of such global approach, but regarding the complexity of flowchart segmentation problem, there is still lot of space to improve the global learning and recognition methods."

The method is robust against the recognition errors of characters and the variation of the printing styles of the documents. The outline is as follows: we first construct a network with vertices representing the characters (symbols), linked with each other by several edges with labels and costs representing the possible relations of the pair of characters. The network has multiple edges with different labels and costs representing the ambiguity of the decision of the relation of character pairs. Then, we output the spanning tree of the network with minimum cost which corresponds to the recognition result of the structure of the mathematical formula, using not only the local costs initially attached to the network but the costs reflecting global structure of the formula. The advantage of this method is that local errors of the recognition are recovered automatically by the total cost of the recognition tree."
