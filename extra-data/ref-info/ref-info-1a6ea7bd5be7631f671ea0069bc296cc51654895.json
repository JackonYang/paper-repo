This facilitates matching between quite disparate views-wide baseline stereo. Two extensions are made to the current small baseline algorithms: first, and most importantly, a viewpoint invariant measure is developed for assessing the affinity of corner neighbourhoods over image pairs; second, algorithms are given for generating putative corner matches between image pairs using local homographies. Two novel infrastructure developments are also described: the automatic generation of local homographies, and the combination of possibly conflicting sets of matches prior to RANSAC estimation. The wide baseline matching algorithm is demonstrated on a number of image pairs with varying relative motion, and for different scene types. All processing is automatic."

The only assumption is that there are some locally planar and unoccluded scene regions that have enough structure to be detected in the image. Those regions are classified by a set of illumination and viewpoint invariant features. The features represent the image in a very compact way and allow fast comparison and feature matching between quite different viewpoints. The matching procedure is embedded in a visual servoing system for a mobile robot. Experiments show its potential for navigation with large camera rotations and view point changes in a cluttered environment without the need for artificial landmarks."

This paper shows that interest points are geometrically stable under different transformations and have high information content (distinctiveness). These two properties make interest points very successful in the contest of image matching. To measure these two properties quantitatively, we introduce two evaluation criteria: repeatability rate and information content. The quality of the interest points depends on the detector used. In this paper several detectors are compared according to the criteria specified above. We determine which detector gives the best results and show that it satisfies the criteria well."

The method works by a comparison of sequences of recorded coordinates with a library of sequences from different individuals. The comparison is based on the evaluation of view invariant and calibration independent view consistency constraints. These constraints are functions of corresponding image coordinates in two views and are satisfied whenever the two views are projected from the same three-dimensional (3D) object. By evaluating the view consistency constraints for each pair of frames in a sequence of a walking person and a stored sequence, we obtain a matrix of consistency values that ideally are zero whenever the pair of images depict the same 3D posture. The method is virtually parameter free and computes a consistency residual between a pair of sequences that can be used as a distance for clustering and classification. Using interactively extracted data we present experimental results that are superior to those of previously published algorithms both in terms of performance and generality."

RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing"

In this paper we further investigate the method and develop robust algorithms for navigation assuming the perspective projection model. In particular, we develop a tracking algorithm that exploits our knowledge of the motion performed by the robot at every step. This algorithm allows us to maintain correspondences between frames and eliminate false correspondences. We combine this tracking algorithm with an iterative optimization procedure to accurately recover the displacement of the robot from the target. Our method for navigation is attractive since it does not require a 3D model of the environment. We demonstrate the robustness of our method by applying it to a six degree of freedom robot arm."
