We show how to improve semantic segmentation through the use of contextual information, specifically, we explore 'patch-patch' context between image regions, and 'patch-background' context. For learning from the patch-patch context, we formulate Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) with CNN-based pairwise potential functions to capture semantic correlations between neighboring patches. Efficient piecewise training of the proposed deep structured model is then applied to avoid repeated expensive CRF inference for back propagation. For capturing the patch-background context, we show that a network design with traditional multi-scale image input and sliding pyramid pooling is effective for improving performance. Our experimental results set new state-of-the-art performance on a number of popular semantic segmentation datasets, including NYUDv2, PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL-Context, and SIFT-flow. In particular, we achieve an intersection-overunion score of 78:0 on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset."

Recent approaches have attempted to harness the capabilities of deep learning techniques for image recognition to tackle pixel-level labelling tasks. One central issue in this methodology is the limited capacity of deep learning techniques to delineate visual objects. To solve this problem, we introduce a new form of convolutional neural network that combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)-based probabilistic graphical modelling. To this end, we formulate Conditional Random Fields with Gaussian pairwise potentials and mean-field approximate inference as Recurrent Neural Networks. This network, called CRF-RNN, is then plugged in as a part of a CNN to obtain a deep network that has desirable properties of both CNNs and CRFs. Importantly, our system fully integrates CRF modelling with CNNs, making it possible to train the whole deep network end-to-end with the usual back-propagation algorithm, avoiding offline post-processing methods for object delineation. We apply the proposed method to the problem of semantic image segmentation, obtaining top results on the challenging Pascal VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark."

We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional networks achieve improved segmentation of PASCAL VOC (30% relative improvement to 67.2% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, SIFT Flow, and PASCAL-Context, while inference takes one tenth of a second for a typical image."

This work brings together methods from DCNNs and probabilistic graphical models for addressing the task of pixel-level classification (also called \"semantic image segmentation\"). We show that responses at the final layer of DCNNs are not sufficiently localized for accurate object segmentation. This is due to the very invariance properties that make DCNNs good for high level tasks. We overcome this poor localization property of deep networks by combining the responses at the final DCNN layer with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF). Qualitatively, our \"DeepLab\" system is able to localize segment boundaries at a level of accuracy which is beyond previous methods. Quantitatively, our method sets the new state-of-art at the PASCAL VOC-2012 semantic image segmentation task, reaching 71.6% IOU accuracy in the test set. We show how these results can be obtained efficiently: Careful network re-purposing and a novel application of the 'hole' algorithm from the wavelet community allow dense computation of neural net responses at 8 frames per second on a modern GPU."

Such pixel-accurate supervision demands expensive labeling effort and limits the performance of deep networks that usually benefit from more training data. In this paper, we propose a method that achieves competitive accuracy but only requires easily obtained bounding box annotations. The basic idea is to iterate between automatically generating region proposals and training convolutional networks. These two steps gradually recover segmentation masks for improving the networks, and vise versa. Our method, called \"BoxSup\", produces competitive results (e.g., 62.0% mAP for validation) supervised by boxes only, on par with strong baselines (e.g., 63.8% mAP) fully supervised by masks under the same setting. By leveraging a large amount of bounding boxes, BoxSup further yields state-of-the-art results on PASCAL VOC 2012 and PASCAL-CONTEXT [26]."

Unlike existing methods based on template matching or Bayesian inference, our approach directly maps low-level visual features to the label maps of body parts with DDN, which is able to accurately estimate complex pose variations with good robustness to occlusions and background clutters. DDN jointly estimates occluded regions and segments body parts by stacking three types of hidden layers: occlusion estimation layers, completion layers, and decomposition layers. The occlusion estimation layers estimate a binary mask, indicating which part of a pedestrian is invisible. The completion layers synthesize low-level features of the invisible part from the original features and the occlusion mask. The decomposition layers directly transform the synthesized visual features to label maps. We devise a new strategy to pre-train these hidden layers, and then fine-tune the entire network using the stochastic gradient descent. Experimental results show that our approach achieves better segmentation accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods on pedestrian images with or without occlusions. Another important contribution of this paper is that it provides a large scale benchmark human parsing dataset that includes 3,673 annotated samples collected from 171 surveillance videos. It is 20 times larger than existing public datasets."

We propose a method that uses a multiscale convolutional network trained from raw pixels to extract dense feature vectors that encode regions of multiple sizes centered on each pixel. The method alleviates the need for engineered features, and produces a powerful representation that captures texture, shape, and contextual information. We report results using multiple postprocessing methods to produce the final labeling. Among those, we propose a technique to automatically retrieve, from a pool of segmentation components, an optimal set of components that best explain the scene; these components are arbitrary, for example, they can be taken from a segmentation tree or from any family of oversegmentations. The system yields record accuracies on the SIFT Flow dataset (33 classes) and the Barcelona dataset (170 classes) and near-record accuracy on Stanford background dataset (eight classes), while being an order of magnitude faster than competing approaches, producing a 320\u00d7240 image labeling in less than a second, including feature extraction."

We develop Expectation-Maximization (EM) methods for semantic image segmentation model training under these weakly supervised and semi-supervised settings. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that the proposed techniques can learn models delivering competitive results on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 image segmentation benchmark, while requiring significantly less annotation effort.

In this paper, we propose a novel, nonparametric approach for object recognition and scene parsing using a new technology we name label transfer. For an input image, our system first retrieves its nearest neighbors from a large database containing fully annotated images. Then, the system establishes dense correspondences between the input image and each of the nearest neighbors using the dense SIFT flow algorithm [28], which aligns two images based on local image structures. Finally, based on the dense scene correspondences obtained from SIFT flow, our system warps the existing annotations and integrates multiple cues in a Markov random field framework to segment and recognize the query image. Promising experimental results have been achieved by our nonparametric scene parsing system on challenging databases. Compared to existing object recognition approaches that require training classifiers or appearance models for each object category, our system is easy to implement, has few parameters, and embeds contextual information naturally in the retrieval/alignment procedure."

We focus on rare object classes, which play an important role in achieving richer semantic understanding of visual scenes, compared to common background classes. Towards this end, we make two novel contributions: rare class expansion and semantic context description. First, considering the long-tailed nature of the label distribution, we expand the retrieval set by rare class exemplars and thus achieve more balanced superpixel classification results. Second, we incorporate both global and local semantic context information through a feedback based mechanism to refine image retrieval and superpixel matching. Results on the SIFTflow and LMSun datasets show the superior performance of our algorithm, especially on the rare classes, without sacrificing overall labeling accuracy."

We propose a novel face parser, which recasts segmentation of face components as a cross-modality data transformation problem, i.e., transforming an image patch to a label map. Specifically, a face is represented hierarchically by parts, components, and pixel-wise labels. With this representation, our approach first detects faces at both the part- and component-levels, and then computes the pixel-wise label maps (Fig.1). Our part-based and component-based detectors are generatively trained with the deep belief network (DBN), and are discriminatively tuned by logistic regression. The segmentators transform the detected face components to label maps, which are obtained by learning a highly nonlinear mapping with the deep autoencoder. The proposed hierarchical face parsing is not only robust to partial occlusions but also provide richer information for face analysis and face synthesis compared with face keypoint detection and face alignment. The effectiveness of our algorithm is shown through several tasks on 2, 239 images selected from three datasets (e.g., LFW [12], BioID [13] and CUFSF [29])."

The introduction of graph cuts has enabled efficient and optimal inference in associative random fields, greatly advancing applications such as segmentation, stereo reconstruction and many others. However, while fast inference is now widespread, parameter learning in random fields has remained an intractable problem. This paper shows how to apply fast inference algorithms, in particular graph cuts, to learn parameters of random fields with similar efficiency. We find optimal parameter values under standard regularized objective functions that ensure good generalization. Our algorithm enables learning of many parameters in reasonable time, and we explore further speedup techniques. We also discuss extensions to non-associative and multi-class problems. We evaluate the method on image segmentation and geometry recognition."

In this paper, we consider fully connected CRF models defined on the complete set of pixels in an image. The resulting graphs have billions of edges, making traditional inference algorithms impractical. Our main contribution is a highly efficient approximate inference algorithm for fully connected CRF models in which the pairwise edge potentials are defined by a linear combination of Gaussian kernels.

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision."

These methods have achieved good results despite using models with only unary and/or pairwise terms. However, previous work has shown the value of using models with higher-order terms e.g. to represent label consistency over large regions, or global co-occurrence relations. We show how these higher-order terms can be formulated such that filter-based inference remains possible. We demonstrate our techniques on joint stereo and object labelling problems, as well as object class segmentation, showing in addition for joint object-stereo labelling how our method provides an efficient approach to inference in product label-spaces. We show that we are able to speed up inference in these models around 10\u201330 times with respect to competing graph-cut/move-making methods, as well as maintaining or improving accuracy in all cases. We show results on PascalVOC-10 for object class segmentation, and Leuven for joint object-stereo labelling."

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry."

This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Objects are labeled using per-instance segmentations to aid in precise object localization. Our dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of 2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images, the creation of our dataset drew upon extensive crowd worker involvement via novel user interfaces for category detection, instance spotting and instance segmentation. We present a detailed statistical analysis of the dataset in comparison to PASCAL, ImageNet, and SUN. Finally, we provide baseline performance analysis for bounding box and segmentation detection results using a Deformable Parts Model."

While delivering impressive results across a range of computer vision and machine learning tasks, these networks are computationally demanding, limiting their deployability. Convolutional layers generally consume the bulk of the processing time, and so in this work we present two simple schemes for drastically speeding up these layers. This is achieved by exploiting cross-channel or filter redundancy to construct a low rank basis of filters that are rank-1 in the spatial domain. Our methods are architecture agnostic, and can be easily applied to existing CPU and GPU convolutional frameworks for tuneable speedup performance. We demonstrate this with a real world network designed for scene text character recognition [15], showing a possible 2.5\u00d7 speedup with no loss in accuracy, and 4.5\u00d7 speedup with less than 1% drop in accuracy, still achieving state-of-the-art on standard benchmarks."

We call this approach VISTA\u2014Vision by Image/Scene TrAining.We apply VISTA to the \u201csuper-resolution\u201d problem (estimating high frequency details from a low-resolution image), showing good results. To illustrate the potential breadth of the technique, we also apply it in two other problem domains, both simplified. We learn to distinguish shading from reflectance variations in a single image under particular lighting conditions. For the motion estimation problem in a \u201cblobs world\u201d, we show figure/ground discrimination, solution of the aperture problem, and filling-in arising from application of the same probabilistic machinery."

Towards this goal, we label every pixel of PASCAL VOC 2010 detection challenge with a semantic category. We believe this data will provide plenty of challenges to the community, as it contains 520 additional classes for semantic segmentation and object detection. Our analysis shows that nearest neighbor based approaches perform poorly on semantic segmentation of contextual classes, showing the variability of PASCAL imagery. Furthermore, improvements of existing contextual models for detection is rather modest. In order to push forward the performance in this difficult scenario, we propose a novel deformable part-based model, which exploits both local context around each candidate detection as well as global context at the level of the scene. We show that this contextual reasoning significantly helps in detecting objects at all scales."

Inference algorithms based on graph cuts and belief propagation have been found to yield accurate results, but despite recent advances are often too slow for practical use. In this paper we present some algorithmic techniques that substantially improve the running time of the loopy belief propagation approach. One of the techniques reduces the complexity of the inference algorithm to be linear rather than quadratic in the number of possible labels for each pixel, which is important for problems such as image restoration that have a large label set. Another technique speeds up and reduces the memory requirements of belief propagation on grid graphs. A third technique is a multi-grid method that makes it possible to obtain good results with a small fixed number of message passing iterations, independent of the size of the input images. Taken together these techniques speed up the standard algorithm by several orders of magnitude. In practice we obtain results that are as accurate as those of other global methods (e.g., using the Middlebury stereo benchmark) while being nearly as fast as purely local methods."

We revisit both the alignment step and the representation step by employing explicit 3D face modeling in order to apply a piecewise affine transformation, and derive a face representation from a nine-layer deep neural network. This deep network involves more than 120 million parameters using several locally connected layers without weight sharing, rather than the standard convolutional layers. Thus we trained it on the largest facial dataset to-date, an identity labeled dataset of four million facial images belonging to more than 4, 000 identities. The learned representations coupling the accurate model-based alignment with the large facial database generalize remarkably well to faces in unconstrained environments, even with a simple classifier. Our method reaches an accuracy of 97.35% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, reducing the error of the current state of the art by more than 27%, closely approaching human-level performance."

But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called \u201cImageNet\u201d, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond."

A standard approach is to formulate it in a dual decomposition framework. However, these models generally suffer from the problem of high computational complexity. In this work, we propose PoseField, a new highly efficient filter-based mean-field inference approach for jointly estimating human segmentation, pose, per-pixel body parts, and depth given stereo pairs of images. We extensively evaluate the efficiency and accuracy offered by our approach on H2View [1], and Buffy [2] datasets. We achieve 20 to 70 times speedup compared to the current state-of-the-art methods, as well as achieving better accuracy in all these cases."

Instead of operating at the pixel level, we advocate the use of superpixels as the basic unit of a class segmentation or pixel localization scheme. To this end, we construct a classifier on the histogram of local features found in each superpixel. We regularize this classifier by aggregating histograms in the neighborhood of each superpixel and then refine our results further by using the classifier in a conditional random field operating on the superpixel graph. Our proposed method exceeds the previously published state-of-the-art on two challenging datasets: Graz-02 and the PASCAL VOC 2007 Segmentation Challenge."

It has recently been shown that mean field inference in dense random fields can be performed efficiently and that these models enable significant accuracy gains in computer vision applications. However, parameter estimation for dense random fields is still poorly understood. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for learning parameters in dense random fields. All parameters are estimated jointly, thus capturing dependencies between them. We show that gradients of a variety of loss functions over the mean field marginals can be computed efficiently. The resulting algorithm learns parameters that directly optimize the performance of mean field inference in the model. As a supporting result, we present an efficient inference algorithm for dense random fields that is guaranteed to converge."

Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained classes that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these specialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

Our contour detector combines multiple local cues into a globalization framework based on spectral clustering. Our segmentation algorithm consists of generic machinery for transforming the output of any contour detector into a hierarchical region tree. In this manner, we reduce the problem of image segmentation to that of contour detection. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that both our contour detection and segmentation methods significantly outperform competing algorithms. The automatically generated hierarchical segmentations can be interactively refined by user-specified annotations. Computation at multiple image resolutions provides a means of coupling our system to recognition applications."

Information-theoretic analysis is applied to evaluate the power of these grouping cues. We train a linear classifier to combine these features. To demonstrate the power of the classification model, a simple algorithm is used to randomly search for good segmentations. Results are shown on a wide range of images."

In this paper, we show that it can be well solved with deep learning and using both face identification and verification signals as supervision. The Deep IDentification-verification features (DeepID2) are learned with carefully designed deep convolutional networks. The face identification task increases the inter-personal variations by drawing DeepID2 features extracted from different identities apart, while the face verification task reduces the intra-personal variations by pulling DeepID2 features extracted from the same identity together, both of which are essential to face recognition. The learned DeepID2 features can be well generalized to new identities unseen in the training data. On the challenging LFW dataset [11], 99.15% face verification accuracy is achieved. Compared with the best previous deep learning result [20] on LFW, the error rate has been significantly reduced by 67%."

Deep learning workloads are computationally intensive, and optimizing the kernels of deep learning workloads is difficult and time-consuming. As parallel architectures evolve, kernels must be reoptimized for new processors, which makes maintaining codebases difficult over time. Similar issues have long been addressed in the HPC community by libraries such as the Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS) [2]. However, there is no analogous library for deep learning. Without such a library, researchers implementing deep learning workloads on parallel processors must create and optimize their own implementations of the main computational kernels, and this work must be repeated as new parallel processors emerge. To address this problem, we have created a library similar in intent to BLAS, with optimized routines for deep learning workloads. Our implementation contains routines for GPUs, and similarly to the BLAS library, could be implemented for other platforms. The library is easy to integrate into existing frameworks, and provides optimized performance and memory usage. For example, integrating cuDNN into Caffe, a popular framework for convolutional networks, improves performance by 36% on a standard model while also reducing memory consumption."

The proposed registration algorithm is being developed by Seth Billings, a graduate student, and it will map the extracted contours to patient CT data in order to enhance registration.

We present a number of examples of graphical models, including the QMR-DT database, the sigmoid belief network, the Boltzmann machine, and several variants of hidden Markov models, in which it is infeasible to run exact inference algorithms. We then introduce variational methods, which exploit laws of large numbers to transform the original graphical model into a simplified graphical model in which inference is efficient. Inference in the simpified model provides bounds on probabilities of interest in the original model. We describe a general framework for generating variational transformations based on convex duality. Finally we return to the examples and demonstrate how variational algorithms can be formulated in each case."

Our algorithm is the first implementation of a high\u2010dimensional Gaussian filter that is both linear in input size and polynomial in dimensionality. Furthermore it is parameter\u2010free, apart from the filter size, and achieves a consistently high accuracy relative to ground truth (> 45 dB). We use this to demonstrate a number of interactive\u2010rate applications of filters in as high as eight dimensions."
