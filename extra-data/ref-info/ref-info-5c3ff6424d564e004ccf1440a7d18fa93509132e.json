TO ALLOW SUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHMS TO MAKE USE OF THIS FLEXIBILITY, THE CURRENT PAPER CONSIDERS HOW TO SPECIFY TARGETS BY SETS OF CONSTRAINTS, RATHER THAN AS PARTICULAR VECTORS. TWO CLASSES OF CONSTRAINTS ARE DISTINGUISHED---`CONFIGURATIONAL'' CONSTRAINTS, WHICH DEFINE REGIONS OF OUTPUT SPACE IN WHICH AN OUTPUT VECTOR MUST LIE, AND `TEMPORAL'' CONSTRAINTS, WHICH DEFINE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN OUTPUTS PRODUCED AT DIFFER- ENT POINTS IN TIME. LEARNING ALGORITHMS MINIMIZE A COST FUNCTION THAT CON- TAINS TERMS FOR BOTH KINDS OF CONSTRAINTS.

Various kinds of reinforcement are considered as special types of input to an agent living in the environment. The agent's only goal is to maximize the amount of reinforcement received over time. Supervised learning techniques for recurrent networks serve to construct a differentiable model of the environmental dynamics which includes a model of future reinforcement. This model is used for learning goal-directed behavior in an online fashion. The possibility of using the system for planning future action sequences is investigated and this approach is compared to approaches based on temporal difference methods.

The task is to balance a pole that is hinged to a movable cart by applying forces to the cart's base. It is argued that the learning problems faced by adaptive elements that are components of adaptive networks are at least as difficult as this version of the pole-balancing problem. The learning system consists of a single associative search element (ASE) and a single adaptive critic element (ACE). In the course of learning to balance the pole, the ASE constructs associations between input and output by searching under the influence of reinforcement feedback, and the ACE constructs a more informative evaluation function than reinforcement feedback alone can provide. The differences between this approach and other attempts to solve problems using neurolike elements are discussed, as is the relation of this work to classical and instrumental conditioning in animal learning studies and its possible implications for research in the neurosciences."

The starting point of this comparison is the article of Rumelhart and Zipser (1985) on feature discovery through competitive learning. All the models which Rumelhart and Zipser (1985) have described were shown in Grossberg (1976b) to exhibit a type of learning which is temporally unstable. Competitive learning mechanisms can be stabilized in response to an arbitrary input environment by being supplemented with mechanisms for learning top-down expectancies, or templates; for matching bottom-up input patterns with the top-down expectancies; and for releasing orienting reactions in a mismatch situation, thereby updating short-term memory and searching for another internal representation. Network architectures which embody all of these mechanisms were called adaptive resonance models by Grossberg (1976c) . Self-stabilizing learning models are candidates for use in real-world applications where unpredictable changes can occur in complex input environments. Competitive learning postulates are inconsistent with the postulates of the interactive activation model of McClelland and Rumelhart (1981) , and suggest different levels of processing and interaction rules for the analysis of word recognition. Adaptive resonance models use these alternative levels and interaction rules. The selforganizing learning of an adaptive resonance model is compared and contrasted with the teacher-directed learning of a back propagation model. A number of criteria for evaluating real-time network models of cognitive processing are described and applied."

The robot's task is to construct an internal model of its environment, a model that will allow it to predict the effects of its actions and to determine what sequences of actions to take to reach particular goal states. Rivest and Schapire (1987a,b; Schapire 1988) have studied this problem and have designed a symbolic algorithm to strategically explore and infer the structure of finite state environments. The heart of this algorithm is a clever representation of the environment called an update graph. We have developed a connectionist implementation of the update graph using a highly specialized network architecture. With backpropagation learning and a trivial exploration strategy choosing random actions the connectionist network can outperform the Rivest and Schapire algorithm on simple problems. Our approach has additional virtues, including the fact that the network can accommodate stochastic environments and that it suggests generalizations of the update graph representation that do not arise from a traditional, symbolic perspective."

A feature of the mathematical model is that a concise description of the behavioral organization of the movement has been formulated which is separate and distinct from the description of the dynamics of movement execution. Based on observations of voluntary movements in primates, the organization has been described as though the goal were to make the smoothest movement possible under the circumstances, i.e., to minimize the accelerative transients. This has been formalized by using dynamic optimization theory to determine the movement which minimizes the rate of change of acceleration (jerk) of the limb. Based on observations of muscle mechanics, the concept of a \u201cvirtual position\u201d determined by the active states of the muscles is rigorously defined as one of the mechanical consequences of the neural commands to the muscles. This provides insight into the mechanics of perturbed and unperturbed movements and is a useful aid in the separation of the descriptions of movement organization and movement execution."

In the controller, a general learning algorithm is used to learn to reproduce the relationship between the sensor outputs and the system command variables over particular regions of the system state space. The learned information is then used to predict the command signals required to produce desired changes in the sensor outputs. The learning controller requires no a priori knowledge of the relationships between the sensor outputs and the command variables, facilitating control system modification for specific applications. The results of two learning experiments using a General Electric P-5 manipulator are presented. The first involved learning to use the video image feedback to position the robot hand accurately relative to stationary objects on a table, assuming no knowledge of the robot kinematics or camera characteristics. The second involved learning to use video image feedback to intercept and track objects moving on a conveyor. In both experiments, control system performance was found to be limited by the resolution of the sensor feedback data, rather than by control structure limitations."

The network studied is based on the visual system. These results are used to infer an information-theoretic principle that can be applied to the network as a whole, rather than a single cell. The organizing principle proposed is that the network connections develop in such a way as to maximize the amount of information that is preserved when signals are transformed at each processing stage, subject to certain constraints.

The model can be learned by storing experiences in the memory. To make predictions, the memory is searched for relevant experience. An initial implementation of such a memory-based modeling scheme has been made on a parallel computer, the Connection Machine. The implementation machine was used to model and control a simulated planar two-joint arm and a simulated running machine. The issues and problems that arose in the preliminary work are described. It is found that the use of parallel search in the implementation of an associative content-addressable memory allows quick searching of stored experiences, and reasonable retrieval is obtained using a simple distance metric and a simple generalized scheme. The memory is able to generalize after storing only a small number of relevant experiences. The use of search by parallel processors also avoids many of the problems of previous memory-based or tubular approaches to robot modeling (such as search speed and memory requirements).<<ETX>>"

A full realization of these potentials will require conscious effort to overcome obsolete rigidities, to develop unified and adaptive methods for integrating complex systems, and to increase our understanding of these systems (understanding which is vital to human productivity in developing software). How adaptive systems may be built and understood by extending control theory and statistics is discussed. Adaptive systems, like human infants, are less agile than young monkeys but have something important to contribute as they mature. It argues that the old dream of understanding intelligence in generalized terms, permitting a unified understanding of adaptive systems and of the human mind, was not incorrect; rather, the early attempts in that direction failed because they did not make full use of research possibilities in statistics, control theory, and numerical analysis (many of which are still unexploited) and were limited by hardware costs which are now coming down. A basic adaptive system derived from this approach fits the fundamental, qualitative empirical facts of human brain physiology in some detail (unlike the usual \"general neuron models,\" which rarely even discriminate between basic components of the brain), and offers opportunities for further research; it can even translate certain fundamental ideas of Freud into something more mathematical and scientific. The mathematics of the basic system, and the fit to the brain, are described in detail."
