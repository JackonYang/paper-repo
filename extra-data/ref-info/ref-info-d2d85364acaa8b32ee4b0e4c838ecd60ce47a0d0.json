There is reason to hope that our new models, for specific systems, will be similar to the models of physics. The paper is divided into three sections. The first argues that computer science is missing many of the things that make the laws of physics so powerful\u2014locality, symmetry, invariance of scale. This is why physics is so nice and computer science isn't. The second section gives an example of a new-wave computing machine, and shows some physicslike laws that apply to its computations. The final section gives some reasons for expecting this convergence of physical and computational law."

It is divided into four major parts: \n \nPart One -- an overview of the concepts and syntax of the programming language. \n \nPart Two -- an annotated and illustrated specification of the system's functionality. \n \nPart Three -- an example of the design and implementation of a moderate-size application. \n \nPart Four -- a specification of the Smalltalk-80 virtual machine."

It is shown that three popular interconnection structures (hypercube, hierarchy, and tree structures) are examples of the cluster structure. Two communication problems (traffic congestion and message delay), which may result in interconnection limitation to a particular structure, are analyzed. The analysis provides a way to understand structural properties such as complexity, capacity, and limitation. Through the use of the cluster structure and the analytical model, topological optimization is presented to show how interconnection limitation can be minimized."

A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention.

A computer can do, in a sense, only what it is told to do. But even when we do not know how to solve a certain problem, we may program a machine (computer) to Search through some large space of solution attempts. Unfortunately, this usually leads to an enormously inefficient process. With Pattern-Recognition techniques, efficiency can often be improved, by restricting the application of the machine's methods to appropriate problems. Pattern-Recognition, together with Learning, can be used to exploit generalizations based on accumulated experience, further reducing search. By analyzing the situation, using Planning methods, we may obtain a fundamental improvement by replacing the given search with a much smaller, more appropriate exploration. To manage broad classes of problems, machines will need to construct models of their environments, using some scheme for Induction. Wherever appropriate, the discussion is supported by extensive citation of the literature and by descriptions of a few of the most successful heuristic (problem-solving) programs constructed to date."

The compiler knows relatively little about specific data manipulation primitives such as arithmetic operators, but concentrates on general issues of environment and control. Rather than having specialized knowledge about a large variety of control and environment constructs, the compiler handles only a small basis set which reflects the semantics of lambda-calculus. All of the traditional imperative constructs, such as sequencing, assignment, looping, GO TO, as well as many standard LISP constructs such as AND, OR and COND, are expressed as macros in terms of the applicative basis set. A small number of optimization techniques, coupled with the treatment of function calls as GO TO statements, serves to produce code as good as that produced by more traditional compilers."

                "text": "Omega is a description system for knowledge embedding which combines mechanisms of the predicate calculus, type systems, and pattern matching systems. It can express arbitrary predicates (achieving the power of the \u03c9-order quantificational calculus), type declarations in programming systems (Algol, Simula, etc.), pattern matching languages (Planner, Merlin, KRL, etc.). Omega gains much of its power by unifying these mechanisms in a single formalism. \n \nOmega is based on a small number of primitive concepts. It is sufficiently powerful to be able to express its own rules of inference In this way Omega represents a self-describing system in which a great deal of knowledge about itself can be embedded. The techniques in Omega represent an important advance in the creation of self-describing systems without engendering the problems discovered by Russell Meta-descriptions (in the sense used in mathematical logic) are ordinary descriptions in Omega. \n \nTogether with Jerry Barber we have constructed a preliminary implementation of Omega on the MLT. CADR System and used it in the development of an office workstation prototype."

Its excellent organizational structure allows quick reference to specific models and its clear presentation . . . solidifies the understanding of the concepts being presented.\"IIE Transactions on Operations EngineeringThoroughly revised and expanded to reflect the latest developments in the field, Fundamentals of Queueing Theory, Fourth Edition continues to present the basic statistical principles that are necessary to analyze the probabilistic nature of queues. Rather than presenting a narrow focus on the subject, this update illustrates the wide-reaching, fundamental concepts in queueing theory and its applications to diverse areas such as computer science, engineering, business, and operations research.This update takes a numerical approach to understanding and making probable estimations relating to queues, with a comprehensive outline of simple and more advanced queueing models. Newly featured topics of the Fourth Edition include:Retrial queuesApproximations for queueing networksNumerical inversion of transformsDetermining the appropriate number of servers to balance quality and cost of serviceEach chapter provides a self-contained presentation of key concepts and formulae, allowing readers to work with each section independently, while a summary table at the end of the book outlines the types of queues that have been discussed and their results. In addition, two new appendices have been added, discussing transforms and generating functions as well as the fundamentals of differential and difference equations. New examples are now included along with problems that incorporate QtsPlus software, which is freely available via the book's related Web site.With its accessible style and wealth of real-world examples, Fundamentals of Queueing Theory, Fourth Edition is an ideal book for courses on queueing theory at the upper-undergraduate and graduate levels. It is also a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners who analyze congestion in the fields of telecommunications, transportation, aviation, and management science."

This method arranges objects into classes representing certain descriptive concepts, rather than into classes defined solely by a similarity metric in some a priori defined attribute space. A specific form of the method is conjunctive conceptual clustering, in which descriptive concepts are conjunctive statements involving relations on selected object attributes and optimized according to an assumed global criterion of clustering quality. The method, implemented in program CLUSTER/2, is tested together with 18 numerical taxonomy methods on two exemplary problems: 1) a construction of a classification of popular microcomputers and 2) the reconstruction of a classification of selected plant disease categories. In both experiments, the majority of numerical taxonomy methods (14 out of 18) produced results which were difficult to interpret and seemed to be arbitrary. In contrast to this, the conceptual clustering method produced results that had a simple interpretation and corresponded well to solutions preferred by people."

In this essay I argue that the different forms of humor can be seen as much more similar, once we recognize the importance of knowledge about knowledge and, particularly, aspects of thinking concerned with recognizing and suppressing bugs \u2014 ineffective or destructive thought processes. When seen in this light, much humor that at first seems pointless, or mysterious, becomes more understandable."

The specific competence to be understood is that of using analogies to do certain kinds of learning and reasoning. Learning takes place when analogy is used to generate a constraint description in one domain, given a constraint description in another, as when we learn Ohm's law by way of knowledge about water pipes. Reasoning takes place when analogy is used to answer questions about one situation, given another situation that is supposed to be a precedent, as when we answer questions about Hamlet by way of knowledge about Macbeth."

The \"pointer transfer\" technique developed for CASSM is used to efficiently mark and output a subgraph stored in one file, and a simple technique is proposed to link parts of the subgraph stored on different files. Besides proposing a useful secondary memory system for applying Artificial Intelligence techniques to large data bases, this paper attacks one of the most difficult problems in distributed data base systems, which is the generation of \"homomorphic query fragments\" that automatically carry the query from one file to other files needed to resolve the query."
