We formulate features that respond to characteristic changes in brightness, color, and texture associated with natural boundaries. In order to combine the information from these features in an optimal way, we train a classifier using human labeled images as ground truth. The output of this classifier provides the posterior probability of a boundary at each image location and orientation. We present precision-recall curves showing that the resulting detector significantly outperforms existing approaches. Our two main results are 1) that cue combination can be performed adequately with a simple linear model and 2) that a proper, explicit treatment of texture is required to detect boundaries in natural images."

In order to prevent its oversegmentation, the notion of dynamics of a minimum, based on geodesic reconstruction, has been proposed. In this paper, we extend the notion of dynamics to the contour arcs. This notion acts as a measure of the saliency of the contour. Contrary to the dynamics of minima, our concept reflects the extension and shape of the corresponding object in the image. This representation is also much more natural, because it is expressed in terms of partitions of the plane, i.e., segmentations. A hierarchical segmentation process is then derived, which gives a compact description of the image, containing all the segmentations one can obtain by the notion of dynamics, by means of a simple thresholding. Finally, efficient algorithms for computing the geodesic reconstruction as well as the dynamics of contours are presented."

The procedure aims at identifying, extracting and classifying visually important features on the image plane, such as regions of homogeneous colour and chromatic transitions. Well established principles of colour theory and graph theory are combined to obtain a unified representation of a colour picture. The picture is represented by means of a weighted graph, constructed so as to reflect the specification of the colour space employed as well as important relationships between picture elements. A spanning tree of the graph is obtained by iteratively minimising a specific picture distortion measure. This tree structure describes a hierarchy of partitions on the image plane. Each partition comprises disjoint regions containing elements with similar attribute. Due to the fact that region identification and edge detection form dual problems from the graph-theoretical viewpoint, region contours defined by such partitions form a hierarchy. To avoid artificial contouring, a specific type of artefact introduced by the segmentation algorithm, the use of higher level information, is considered. It is shown that, when texture (which is taken into account at an intermediate stage of picture segmentation) is combined with colour as joint similarity attributes of regions, an improved hierarchical description of contours is possible. This facilitates the progressive elimination of the undesirable contours and leads to the visual enhancement of the segmentation obtained."

In computer vision, a fundamental problem is to appropriately decompose the domain R of a function g (x,y) of two variables. This problem starts by describing the physical situation which produces images: assume that a three-dimensional world is observed by an eye or camera from some point P and that g1(rho) represents the intensity of the light in this world approaching the point sub 1 from a direction rho. If one has a lens at P focusing this light on a retina or a film-in both cases a plane domain R in which we may introduce coordinates x, y then let g(x,y) be the strength of the light signal striking R at a point with coordinates (x,y); g(x,y) is essentially the same as sub 1 (rho) -possibly after a simple transformation given by the geometry of the imaging syste. The function g(x,y) defined on the plane domain R will be called an image. What sort of function is g? The light reflected off the surfaces Si of various solid objects O sub i visible from P will strike the domain R in various open subsets R sub i. When one object O1 is partially in front of another object O2 as seen from P, but some of object O2 appears as the background to the sides of O1, then the open sets R1 and R2 will have a common boundary (the 'edge' of object O1 in the image defined on R) and one usually expects the image g(x,y) to be discontinuous along this boundary.
