Each cell of a table is arranged regularly in two dimensions and is represented by a row-column pair. Even in the absence of ruled lines, its coordinates are explicitly found. Thus, it is assumed that an arrangement of textblocks defines the table structure, which is an arrangement of rows and columns, and ruled lines make clear their relationship. This process is composed of two procedures: the expansion of cell bounding boxes and the assignment of row-column numbers to each edge. It is shown that the method can be applied to partially ruled tables with some experimental results.<<ETX>>"

While most research in the area of table analysis and recognition has focused on analyzing the raster image, our approach builds upon the advances in optical character recognition (OCR) software to preserve the layout of tabular data by means of white space. By using methods to analyze the geometry, syntax, and the semantics of the character data, as well as utilizing some well-known image processing techniques, we are able to 1) isolate embedded tables from documents, and 2) identify table components uch as title blocks, table entries, and footer blocks. Furthermore, the table analysis techniques presented in this paper can also be applied when analyzing blocks of text isolated by traditional methods such as connected component analysis[1] or bounding box [2]."

It is very important to be able to classify table and figure areas automatically. Furthermore, in tables, the column and row in which a character string is located are very important pieces of information. To detect and analyze table areas, the following method is applied: First, areas that may contain tables or figures are distinguished from text areas by the presence of horizontal and vertical lines. Next, the areas are assumed to be table areas and are analyzed as such. A judgment is made on whether each of the areas can in fact be a table area or not; in this way, the actual table areas are detected. Finally, the structures of the areas are analyzed and character strings in the areas are arranged by using the DP matching method. This method was applied to sixty-five pages of Japanese technical papers, magazines, manuals for software programs, and pages including 34 table areas, 48 line drawing areas, and 35 image areas. As a result, 96.6 percent of the areas were detected correctly and 91.7 percent of the tables were analyzed and arranged correctly."

White streams are recognized in both the horizontal and vertical direction as substitutes for any missing demarcation lines.

This paper is part of an overview about the combined research efforts in document analysis at DFKI. Common to all document analysis projects is the global goal of providing a high level electronic representation of documents in terms of iconic, structural, textual, and semantic information. These symbolic document descriptions enable an \u201cintelligent\u201d access to a document database. Currently there are three ongoing document analysis projects at DFKI: INCA, OMEGA, and PASCAL2000/PASCAL+. Although the projects pursue different goals in different application domains, they all share the same problems which have to be resolved with similar techniques. For that reason the activities in these projects are bundled to avoid redundant work. At DFKI we have divided the problem of document analysis into two main tasks, text recognition and information extraction, which themselves are divided into a set of subtasks. In a series of three research reports the work of the document analysis and office automation department at DFKI is presented. The first report discusses the problem of text recognition, the second that of information extraction. In a third report we describe our concept for a specialized knowledge representation language for document analysis. The report in hand describes the activities dealing with the information extraction task. Information extraction covers the phases text analysis, message type identification and file integration."
