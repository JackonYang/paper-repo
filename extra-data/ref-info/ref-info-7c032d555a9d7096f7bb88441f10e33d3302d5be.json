One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding7\u201312. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties13\u201318, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal8,12 that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs."

Histograms of spatial frequency bandwidth, orientation tuning bandwidth, aspect ratio and length of the receptive fields match well. This indicates that simple cells are well tuned to the expected statistics of natural stimuli. There is no match, however, in calculated and measured distributions for the peak of the spatial frequency response: the filters produced by ICA do not vary their spatial scale as much as simple cells do, but are fixed to scales close to the finest ones allowed by the sampling lattice. Possible ways to resolve this discrepancy are discussed."

We show that the observed structure of the topographic map can arise from a principle of continuous mapping. For the realization of this principle we use a mathematical model that can be interpreted as an adaptive process changing a set of synaptic weights, or synaptic connection strengths, between two layers of cells. The patterns of orientation preference and selectivity generated by the model are similar to the patterns seen in the visual cortex of macaque monkey and cat and correspond to a neural projection that maps a more than two-dimensional feature space onto a two-dimensional cortical surface under the constraint that shape and position of the receptive fields of the neurons very smoothly over the cortical surface."

                "text": "It is well established that multiple stimulus dimensions (e.g., orientation and spatial frequency) are mapped onto the surface of striate cortex. However, the detailed organization of neurons within a local region of striate cortex remains unclear. Within a vertical column, do all neurons have the same response selectivities? And if not, how do they most commonly differ and why? To address these questions, we recorded from nearby pairs of simple cells and made detailed spatiotemporal maps of their receptive fields. From these maps, we extracted and analyzed a variety of response metrics. Our results provide new insights into the local organization of striate cortex. First, we show that nearby neurons seldom have very similar receptive fields, when these fields are characterized in space and time. Thus, there may be less redundancy within a column than previously thought. Moreover, we show that correlated discharge increases with receptive field similarity; thus, the local dissimilarity between neurons may allow for noise reduction by response pooling. Second, we show that several response variables are clustered within striate cortex, including some that have not received much attention such as response latency and temporal frequency. We also demonstrate that other parameters are not clustered, including the spatial phase (or symmetry) of the receptive field. Third, we show that spatial phase is the single parameter that accounts for most of the difference between receptive fields of nearby neurons. We consider the implications of this local diversity of spatial phase for population coding and construction of higher-order receptive fields."

Particular attention is given to the fact that receptive field profiles of simple cells in the visual cortex often resemble even-symmetric or odd-symmetric Gabor filters; i.e. their receptive field profiles can be described by the product of a Gaussian and either a cosine or sine function. Their spatial frequency tuning is of medium bandwidth (~one octave) which is narrow enough for a cell to distinguish the third harmonic from the fundamental frequency for square-wave gratings of low spatial frequency. The responses of adjacent simple cells, tuned to the same spatial frequency, orientation, and direction, differ in their phase response to drifting sine-wave gratings by approximately either 90\u00b0 or 180\u00b0. This latter result makes it possible to consider two adjacent simple cell pairs as operating like paired Gaussian-attenuated sine and cosine filters of Gabor filters for restricted regions of visual space. The entire set of simple cells provides a complete representation of the visual scene, yet each simple cell is unique in its response properties. At the complex cell stage, the cell's mean firing rate appears to represent the amplitude of a local Fourier coefficient, but phase information is seldom conveyed with much precision in the action potential code."

Although the coefficients of this representation are nearly decorrelated, they exhibit important higher-order statistical dependencies that cannot be eliminated with purely linear procssing. In particular, rectified coefficients corresponding to basis functions at neighboring spatial positions, orientations and scales are highly correlated. A method of removing these dependencies is to divide each coefficient by a weighted combination of its rectified neighbors. Several successful models of the steady -state behavior of neurons in primary visual cortex are based on such \"divisive normalization\" computations, and thus our analysis provides a theoretical justification for these models. Perhaps more importantly, the statistical measurements explicitly specify the weights that should be used in computing the normalization signal. We demonstrate that this weighting is qualitatively consistent with recent physiological experiments that characterize the suppressive effect of stimuli presented outside of the classical receptive field. Our observations thus provide evidence for the hypothesis that early visual neural processing is well matched to these statistical properties of images."

Although parsimonious and highly influential, the pure hierarchical model has since been challenged by results indicating that many complex cells receive excitatory monosynaptic input from LGN cells or do not depend on simple cell input. Alternative accounts of complex cell orientation tuning remain scant, however, and the function of monosynaptic LGN contacts onto complex cell dendrites remains unknown. We have used a biophysically detailed compartmental model to investigate whether nonlinear integration of LGN synaptic inputs within the dendrites of individual pyramidal cells could contribute to complex-cell receptive field structure. We show that an isolated cortical neuron with \u201cactive\u201d dendrites, driven only by excitatory inputs from overlapping ON- and OFF-center LGN subfields, can produce clear phase-invariant orientation tuning\u2014a hallmark response characteristic of a complex cell. The tuning is shown to depend critically both on the spatial arrangement of LGN synaptic contacts across the complex cell dendritic tree, established by a Hebbian developmental principle, and on the physiological efficacy of excitatory voltage-dependent dendritic ion channels. We conclude that unoriented LGN inputs to a complex cell could contribute in a significant way to its orientation tuning, acting in concert with oriented inputs to the same cell provided by simple cells or other complex cells. As such, our model provides a novel, experimentally testable hypothesis regarding the basis of orientation tuning in the complex cell population, and more generally underscores the potential importance of nonlinear intradendritic subunit processing in cortical neurophysiology."

                "text": "1. All complex cells in the cat's striate cortex exhibit gross non\u2010linearities of spatial summation when tested with sinusoidal grating stimuli. Their responses to moving gratings of all but the lowest spatial frequencies are usually dominated by a component that is not modulated by the passage of the bars of the grating across the receptive field. They give responses to temporally modulated stationary gratings that consist mostly of even harmonics of the stimulus frequency and that vary little in amplitude or wave form as the spatial phase of the grating is varied. 2. We compared complex cells' receptive fields with their sensitivity to sinusoidal gratings of different spatial frequencies. Qualitatively, the receptive fields are usually two to five times wider than the bars of the gratings that stimulate them most effectively. Quantitatively, the receptive field profiles of complex cells are invariably broader than those predicted by Fourier synthesis of their spatial frequency tuning curves, and in particular lack predicted spatially antagonistic regions. 3. We further examined the receptive field organization of these cells, using pairs of stationary lines flashed synchronously on their receptive fields. If both lines are of the same polarity (bright or dark), complex cells respond to the paired stimulus much less well than they do to either of its component bars, unless the bars are separated by less than about one quarter of the width of the receptive field. If the lines are of opposite polarity, one bright and one dark, the opposite situation obtains: closely spaced bars elicit small responses, while paired bars of larger separation are much more effective. In either case, the results are independent in general character of the absolute positions of the stimuli within the receptive field; rather, they depend in a manner characteristic of each cell on the relative positions of the two bars. 4. The two\u2010line interaction profile that plots the change in a complex cell's response to one bar as a function of the position of a second added bar corresponds closely to the receptive field profile predicted from Fourier synthesis of the cell's spatial frequency tuning curve. These profiles may thus reveal the spatial characteristics of subunits within complex cell\u2010receptive fields. We examined the nature of the interaction between these subunits by performing several two\u2010line interaction experiments in which the onset of the second bar was delayed some time after the onset of the first. The results suggest that neighbouring subunits interact in a facilitatory fashion: for an interval after the presentation of one bar, responses to neighbouring bars are enhanced. 5. The subunits of a complex receptive field may, by their spatial properties, determine the spatial selectivities of complex cells, while the nature of the interaction among the subunits may determine these cells' sensitivity and selectivity for moving visual stimuli..."

It is shown that performing independent component analysis on video sequences of natural scenes produces results with qualitatively similar spatiotemporal properties. Whereas the independent components of video resemble moving edges or bars, the independent component filters, i.e. the analogues of receptive fields, resemble moving sinusoids windowed by steady gaussian envelopes. Contrary to earlier ICA results on static images, which gave only filters at the finest possible spatial scale, the spatiotemporal analysis yields filters at a range of spatial and temporal scales. Filters centered at low spatial frequencies are generally tuned to faster movement than those at high spatial frequencies."

Correlation-based models for their development are then discussed, beginning with the models of Von der Malsburg. For the case of semilinear models, model behavior is well understood: correlations determine receptive field structure, intracortical interactions determine projective field structure, and the \u201cknitting together\u201d of the two determines the cortical map. This provides a basis for simple but powerful models of ocular dominance and orientation column formation: ocular dominance columns form through a correlation-based competition between left-eye and right-eye inputs, while orientation columns can form through a competition between ON-center and OFF-center inputs. These models account well for receptive field structure but are not completely adequate to account for the details of cortical map structure. Alternative approaches to map structure, including the self-organizing feature map of Kohonen, are discussed. Finally, theories of the computational function of correlation-based and self-organizing rules are discussed."

                "text": "Of the many possible functions of the macaque monkey primary visual cortex (striate cortex, area 17) two are now fairly well understood. First, the incoming information from the lateral geniculate bodies is rearranged so that most cells in the striate cortex respond to specifically oriented line segments, and, second, information originating from the two eyes converges upon single cells. The rearrangement and convergence do not take place immediately, however: in layer IVc, where the bulk of the afferents terminate, virtually all cells have fields with circular symmetry and are strictly monocular, driven from the left eye or from the right, but not both; at subsequent stages, in layers above and below IVc, most cells show orientation specificity, and about half are binocular. In a binocular cell the receptive fields in the two eyes are on corresponding regions in the two retinas and are identical in structure, but one eye is usually more effective than the other in influencing the cell; all shades of ocular dominance are seen. These two functions are strongly reflected in the architecture of the cortex, in that cells with common physiological properties are grouped together in vertically organized systems of columns. In an ocular dominance column all cells respond preferentially to the same eye. By four independent anatomical methods it has been shown that these columns have the form of vertically disposed alternating left-eye and right-eye slabs, which in horizontal section form alternating stripes about 400 \u03bcm thick, with occasional bifurcations and blind endings. Cells of like orientation specificity are known from physiological recordings to be similarly grouped in much narrower vertical sheeet-like aggregations, stacked in orderly sequences so that on traversing the cortex tangentially one normally encounters a succession of small shifts in orientation, clockwise or counterclockwise; a 1 mm traverse is usually accompanied by one or several full rotations through 180\u00b0, broken at times by reversals in direction of rotation and occasionally by large abrupt shifts. A full complement of columns, of either type, left-plus-right eye or a complete 180\u00b0 sequence, is termed a hypercolumn. Columns (and hence hypercolumns) have roughly the same width throughout the binocular part of the cortex. The two independent systems of hypercolumns are engrafted upon the well known topographic representation of the visual field. The receptive fields mapped in a vertical penetration through cortex show a scatter in position roughly equal to the average size of the fields themselves, and the area thus covered, the aggregate receptive field, increases with distance from the fovea. A parallel increase is seen in reciprocal magnification (the number of degrees of visual field corresponding to 1 mm of cortex). Over most or all of the striate cortex a movement of 1-2 mm, traversing several hypercolumns, is accompanied by a movement through the visual field about equal in size to the local aggregate receptive field. Thus any 1-2 mm block of cortex contains roughly the machinery needed to subserve an aggregate receptive field. In the cortex the fall-off in detail with which the visual field is analysed, as one moves out from the foveal area, is accompanied not by a reduction in thickness of layers, as is found in the retina, but by a reduction in the area of cortex (and hence the number of columnar units) devoted to a given amount of visual field: unlike the retina, the striate cortex is virtually uniform morphologically but varies in magnification. In most respects the above description fits the newborn monkey just as well as the adult, suggesting that area 17 is largely genetically programmed. The ocular dominance columns, however, are not fully developed at birth, since the geniculate terminals belonging to one eye occupy layer IVc throughout its length, segregating out into separate columns only after about the first 6 weeks, whether or not the animal has visual experience. If one eye is sutured closed during this early period the columns belonging to that eye become shrunken and their companions correspondingly expanded. This would seem to be at least in part the result of interference with normal maturation, though sprouting and retraction of axon terminals are not excluded."

                "text": "A number of recent attempts have been made to describe early sensory coding in terms of a general information processing strategy. In this paper, two strategies are contrasted. Both strategies take advantage of the redundancy in the environment to produce more effective representations. The first is described as a compact coding scheme. A compact code performs a transform that allows the input to be represented with a reduced number of vectors (cells) with minimal RMS error. This approach has recently become popular in the neural network literature and is related to a process called Principal Components Analysis (PCA). A number of recent papers have suggested that the optimal compact code for representing natural scenes will have units with receptive field profiles much like those found in the retina and primary visual cortex. However, in this paper, it is proposed that compact coding schemes are insufficient to account for the receptive field properties of cells in the mammalian visual pathway. In contrast, it is proposed that the visual system is near to optimal in representing natural scenes only if optimality is defined in terms of sparse distributed coding. In a sparse distributed code, all cells in the code have an equal response probability across the class of images but have a low response probability for any single image. In such a code, the dimensionality is not reduced. Rather, the redundancy of the input is transformed into the redundancy of the firing pattern of cells. It is proposed that the signature for a sparse code is found in the fourth moment of the response distribution (i.e., the kurtosis). In measurements with 55 calibrated natural scenes, the kurtosis was found to peak when the bandwidths of the visual code matched those of cells in the mammalian visual cortex. Codes resembling wavelet transforms are proposed to be effective because the response histograms of such codes are sparse (i.e., show high kurtosis) when presented with natural scenes. It is proposed that the structure of the image that allows sparse coding is found in the phase spectrum of the image. It is suggested that natural scenes, to a first approximation, can be considered as a sum of self-similar local functions (the inverse of a wavelet). Possible reasons for why sensory systems would evolve toward sparse coding are presented."

First, the incoming information from the lateral geniculate bodies is rearranged so that most cells in the striate cortex respond to specifically oriented line segments, and, second, information originating from the two eyes converges upon single cells. The rearrangement and convergence do not take place immediately, however: in layer IV c, where the bulk of the afferents terminate, virtually all cells have fields with circular symmetry and are strictly monocular, driven from the left eye or from the right, but not both; at subsequent stages, in layers above and below IV c, most cells show orientation specificity, and about half are binocular. In a binocular cell the receptive fields in the two eyes are on corresponding regions in the two retinas and are identical in structure, but one eye is usually more effective than the other in influencing the cell; all shades of ocular dominance are seen. These two functions are strongly reflected in the architecture of the cortex, in that cells with common physiological properties are grouped together in vertically organized systems of columns. In an ocular dominance column all cells respond preferentially to the same eye. By four independent anatomical methods it has been shown that these columns have the"

It is shown that even a single developing cell of a layered network exhibits a remarkable set of optimization properties that are closely related to issues in statistics, theoretical physics, adaptive signal processing, the formation of knowledge representation in artificial intelligence, and information theory. The network studied is based on the visual system. These results are used to infer an information-theoretic principle that can be applied to the network as a whole, rather than a single cell. The organizing principle proposed is that the network connections develop in such a way as to maximize the amount of information that is preserved when signals are transformed at each processing stage, subject to certain constraints. The operation of this principle is illustrated for some simple cases.<<ETX>>"

In this article, we show that the same principle of independence maximization can explain the emergence of phase- and shift-invariant features, similar to those found in complex cells. This new kind of emergence is obtained by maximizing the independence between norms of projections on linear subspaces (instead of the independence of simple linear filter outputs). The norms of the projections on such independent feature subspaces then indicate the values of invariant features."

A considerable amount of work has been dedicated to unraveling both their detailed structure and the neural mechanisms that underlie their formation and development. Many schemes have been proposed, some of which are in competition. Some models focus on development of receptive fields while others focus on the structure of cortical maps, i.e., the arrangement of receptive field properties across the cortex. Each model used different means to determine its success at reproducing experimental map patterns, often relying principally on visual comparison. Experimental data are becoming available that allow a more careful evaluation of models. In this contribution more than 10 of the most prominent models of cortical map formation and structure are critically evaluated and compared with the most recent experimental findings from macaque striate cortex. Comparisons are based on properties of the predicted or measured cortical map patterns. We introduce several new measures for comparing experimental and model map data that reveal important differences between models. We expect that the use of these measures will improve current models by helping determine parameters to match model maps to experimental data now becoming available from a variety of species. Our study reveals that (1) despite apparent differences, many models are based on similar principles and consequently make similar predictions, (2) several models produce orientation map patterns that are not consistent with the experimental data from macaques, regardless of the plausibility of the models' suggested physiological implementations, and (3) no models have yet fully accounted for both the local and the global relationships between orientation and ocular dominance map patterns."

The presence of such maps has been demonstrated in different species of mammals for several parameters characterizing the visual space: retinotopy, ocular dominance, orientation, direction of motion and spatial frequency. In this study we used the optical imaging of intrinsic signals to simultaneously record the multiple functional maps in the same animal in order to obtain a comprehensive set of rules that govern mutual dependencies among the functional maps. Our results indicate that while orientation, direction and ocular dominance are represented on the cortex in a mutually dependent manner, the representation of spatial frequency is independent of the other types of cortical representations. The presence and/or absence of mutual dependence among the multiple functional maps are suggested to provide an important clue for the understanding of the development of visual cortical information representation in neonatal animals."

                "text": "The repetitive stochastic patterns of eye dominance and orientation preference found in the mammalian visual cortex have attracted much attention from theoretical neurobiologists during the last two decades. Reasons for this include the visually intriguing nature of the patterns and the fact that many aspects of their development seem likely to be dependent upon both spontaneous and visually driven patterns of neural activity. Understanding these processes holds out the promise that general theories of learning and memory may be derived from those found to be applicable to the visual cortex. It has turned out, in fact, that remarkably simple models, based on Hebbian synaptic plasticity, intracortical interactions and competitive interactions between cells and growing axons, have been able to explain much of the phenomenology. This article reviews the models of topographic organization in the visual cortex in a roughly historical sequence, beginning with von der Malsburg's paper 1973 paper in Kybernetik on self-organization of orientation selectivity. The principles on which each of the models is based are explained, and the plausibility of each model and the extent to which it is able to account for the relevant experimental data are evaluated. Attention is drawn to the underlying similarities and differences between the models and suggestions are made for future directions in research."

It is shown that performing independent component analysis (ICA) on video sequences of natural scenes produces results with qualitatively similar spatio-temporal properties. Whereas the independent components of video resemble moving edges or bars, the independent component filters, i.e. the analogues of receptive fields, resemble moving sinusoids windowed by steady Gaussian envelopes. Contrary to earlier ICA results on static images, which gave only filters at the finest possible spatial scale, the spatio\u2013temporal analysis yields filters at a range of spatial and temporal scales. Filters centred at low spatial frequencies are generally tuned to faster movement than those at high spatial frequencies."

Here we used optical imaging based on intrinsic signals to show that the visual cortex of kittens reared in a striped environment responded to all orientations, but devoted up to twice as much surface area to the experienced orientation as the orthogonal one. This effect is due to an instructive role of visual experience whereby some neurons shift their orientation preferences toward the experienced orientation. Thus, although cortical orientation maps are remarkably rigid in the sense that orientations that have never been seen by the animal occupy a large portion of the cortical territory, visual experience can nevertheless alter neuronal responses to oriented contours."

We have found that, in a simple case2, certain self-organizing models3,4 generate maps that are near-optimally local, in the sense that they come close to minimizing the neuronal wiring required for local operations. When these self-organizing models are applied to the task of simultaneously mapping retinotopic position and orientation, they produce maps with orientation vortices resembling those produced in primary visual cortex5. This approach also yields a new prediction, which is that the mapping of position in visual cortex will be distorted in the orientation fracture zones5"

This structure may differ from the intrinsic structure of natural scenes, because sampling of the environment is an active process. For example, humans move their eyes several times a second when looking at a scene. The portions of a scene that fall on the fovea are sampled at high spatial resolution, and receive a disproportionate fraction of cortical processing. We recorded the eye positions of human subjects while they viewed images of natural scenes. We report that active selection affected the statistics of the stimuli encountered by the fovea, and also by the parafovea up to eccentricities of 4 degrees. We found two related effects. First, subjects looked at image regions that had high spatial contrast. Second, in these regions, the intensities of nearby image points (pixels) were less correlated with each other than in images selected at random. These effects could serve to increase the information available to the visual system for further processing. We show that both of these effects can be simply obtained by constructing an artificial ensemble comprised of the highest-contrast regions of images."

As more and more columnar systems are discovered it becomes increasingly important to establish the rules that govern the geometric relationships between different columns. As a first step to examine this issue we investigated the spatial relationships between the orientation, ocular dominance, and spatial frequency domains in cat area 17. Using optical imaging of intrinsic signals we obtained high resolution maps for each of these stimulus features from the same cortical regions. We found clear relationships between orientation and ocular dominance columns: many iso-orientation lines intersected the borders between ocular dominance borders at right angles, and orientation singularities were concentrated in the center regions of the ocular dominance columns. Similar, albeit weaker geometric relationships were observed between the orientation and spatial frequency domains. The ocular dominance and spatial frequency maps were also found to be spatially related: there was a tendency for the low spatial frequency domains to avoid the border regions of the ocular dominance columns. This specific arrangement of the different columnar systems might ensure that all possible combinations of stimulus features are represented at least once in any given region of the visual cortex, thus avoiding the occurrence of functional blind spots for a particular stimulus attribute in the visual field."

This article considers the effects of including chromatic and stereo information. The inclusion of colour leads to features divided into separate red/green, blue/yellow, and bright/dark channels. Stereo image data, on the other hand, leads to binocular receptive fields which are tuned to various disparities. The similarities between these results and the observed properties of simple cells in the primary visual cortex are further evidence for the hypothesis that visual cortical neurons perform some type of redundancy reduction, which was one of the original motivations for ICA in the first place. In addition, ICA provides a principled method for feature extraction from colour and stereo images; such features could be used in image processing operations such as denoising and compression, as well as in pattern recognition."

(i) Is there a periodic anatomical arrangement of cells tuned to different spatial-frequency ranges? We found there is, because the spatial-frequency tuning of cells along tangential probes changed systematically, varying from a low frequency to a middle range to high frequencies and back again repeatedly over distances of about 0.6-0.7 mm. (ii) Are there just two populations of cells, low-frequency and high-frequency units, at a given eccentricity (perhaps corresponding to the magno- and parvocellular geniculate pathways) or is there a continuum of spatial-frequency peaks? We found a continuum of peak tuning. Most cells are tuned to intermediate spatial frequencies and form a unimodal rather than a bimodal distribution of cell peaks. Furthermore, the cells with different peak frequencies were found to be continuously and smoothly distributed across a module. (iii) What is the relation between the physiological spatial-frequency organization and the regions of high CytOx concentration (\"blobs\")? We found a systematic correlation between the topographical variation in spatial-frequency tuning and the modular CytOx pattern, which also varied continuously in density. Low-frequency cells are at the center of the blobs, and cells tuned to increasingly higher spatial frequencies are at increasing radial distances."

                "text": "When macaque monkeys view achromatic, sinusoidal gratings of a single spatial frequency, the pattern of 14C-2-deoxy-d-glucose (DG) uptake produced by the gratings is shown to depend on the spatial frequency chosen. When a relatively high (5\u20137 cycles/deg) spatial frequency is shown binocularly at systematically varied orientations, uptake in parafoveal striate cortex is highest between the cytochrome oxidase blobs (that is, in the interblobs) in layers 1, 2, and 3. In layers 4B, 5, and 6, where the cytochrome oxidase blobs are faint or absent, DG uptake is highest in a periodic pattern that lies in register with the interblobs of layers 2 + 3. When the grating is, instead, of relatively low (1\u20131.5 cycles/deg) spatial frequency, DG uptake is highest in the blobs, in the blob-aligned portions of layers 1\u20134B, and in the lower- layer blobs as well. These variations in DG topography are confirmed in stimulus comparisons within a single hemisphere. Presumably, this shift in functional topography within the extra-granular layer is the primate homolog of \u201cspatial frequency columns\u201d shown earlier in the cat (Tootell et al., 1981; Silverman, 1984). In the well-differentiated architecture of primate striate cortex, laminar differences produced by high- versus low-spatial-frequency gratings are visible as well. Gratings of very high spatial frequency produce much higher uptake in 4Cb (which receives input from the parvocellular LGN layers) than in 4Ca (which gets its input from the magnocellular LGN layers). Gratings of low spatial frequency produce the converse result. Presumably, cells in the magnocellular LGN layers and/or in the magnocellular-dominated layer 4Ca have lower average spatial frequency tuning (larger receptive fields) than their counterparts in the parvocellular LGN and/or in striate layer 4Cb. The DG patterns produced by various spatial frequencies also vary with eccentricity, in a manner consistent with known, eccentricity-dependent variations of receptive-field size and spatial frequency tuning. Thus, gratings of a \u201cmiddle\u201d-spatial- frequency range (4\u20135 cycles/deg) produce high uptake in the blobs near the foveal representation and high uptake in the interblobs at more peripheral eccentricities, including 5 degrees. This shift in DG topography also includes the transition zone near 3 degrees, where the level of stimulus-driven uptake is as high in the blob regions as it is in interblob regions. Variations in uptake between layers 4Ca and 4Cb, as a function of eccentricity, shift in parallel with the changes in the upper-layer topography."

There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign."

In the central half of V1, the cortical magnification was found to be greater along the vertical than along the horizontal meridian, and overall magnification factors appeared to be scaled proportionate to brain size across different species. The cortical magnification factor (CMF) was found to reach a maximum of about 15 mm/deg at the representation of the fovea, at a point of acute curvature in the V1-V2 border. We find neither a duplication nor an overrepresentation of the vertical meridian. The magnification factor did not appear to be doubled in a direction perpendicular to the ocular dominance strips; it may not be increased at all. The DG borders in parvorecipient layer 4Cb were found to be as sharp as 140 micron (half-amplitude, half width), corresponding to a visual angle of less than 2\u2032 of arc at the eccentricity measured. In other layers (including magnorecipient layer 4Ca), the retinotopic borders are broader. The retinotopic spread of activity is greater when produced by a low-spatial-frequency grating than when produced by a high-spatial-frequency grating. Orientation- specific stimuli produced a pattern of activation that spread further than 1 mm across cortex in some layers. Some DG evidence suggests that the spread of functional activity is greater near the foveal representation than near 5 degrees eccentricity."

High-resolution maps of these three subsystems were acquired. Optical imaging based on activity-dependent intrinsic signals revealed that the most prominent organizational feature of orientation preference was a radial arrangement, forming a pinwheel-like structure surrounding a singularity point. More than 80% of these pinwheels were centered along the midline of ocular-dominance columns. The iso-orientation contours of adjacent pinwheels crossed borders of ocular-dominance columns at approximately right angles. Pinwheels with the same or opposite directions of orientation-preference change were smoothly connected with each other. On the average, all orientations were equally represented. In exactly the same cortical area, the cytochrome oxidase blobs, thought to be involved in color processing, were also mapped, using cytochrome oxidase histology. Like the centers of pinwheels, the centers of blobs also lie along the midline of ocular-dominance columns. However, the centers of pinwheels did not coincide with the centers of blobs; these two subsystems are spatially independent. \"Hypercolumn\" modules, each including two complete pinwheels in two adjacent columns of complementary ocularity, as well as portions of a few blobs, were frequently found but did not seem to be the primary unit of cortical organization. An alternative to hypercolumns is proposed."

Most of these linear zones lie between the centers of adjacent ocular dominance columns, with their short iso-orientation slabs oriented perpendicular, in regions enjoying the greatest binocular overlap. These two-dimensional linear zones are segregated by one- and zero- dimensional discontinuities that are particularly abundant in the centers of ocular dominance columns, and that are also correlated with cytochrome oxidase-rich zones within them. Discontinuities smaller than 90 degrees extend in one dimension, as fractures, while discontinuities greater than 90 degrees are confined to points, in the form of singularities, that are generated when orientation preferences rotate continuously through +/- 180 degrees along circular paths. The continuous rotations through 180 degrees imply that direction preferences are not organized laterally in striate cortex. And they also ensure that preferences for all orientations converge at each singularity, with perpendicular orientations represented uniquely close together on opposite sides. The periodic interspersing of linear zones and singularities suggests that orientation preferences are organized by at least two competing schemes. They are optimized for linearity, along with selectivity and binocularity, in the linear zones, and they are optimized for density near singularities. Since upper-layer neurons are likely to have similarly sized dendritic fields in all regions (Lund and Yoshioka, 1991), those in the linear zones should receive precise information about narrowly constrained orientations, while those near singularities should receive coarse information about all orientations--very different inputs that suggest different perceptual functions."

In practice, however, the estimated independent components are often not at all independent. We propose that this residual dependence structure could be used to define a topo-graphic order for the components. In particular, a distance between two components could be defined using their higher-order correlations, and this distance could be used to create a topographic representation. Thus, we obtain a linear decomposition into approximately independent components, where the dependence of two components is approximated by the proximity of the components in the topographic representation."

Each point is the average of 10 experiments. to estimate the cross-cumulants. Each point in Fig. 1 corresponds to the average over 10 experiments, in which the mixing matrix is randomly chosen: The matrix entries mC3 (i # j) are random numbers in the range [-1, +1]. With 500 samples, a residual crosstalk of about-20 dB is obtained. In the case of nonstationary signals, cross-cumulant estimation must be done on few samples and has a larger variance. Consequently, it can lead to more inaccurate estimation of the mixing matrix. We still obtained an interesting performance: a residual crosstalk of about-15 to-20 dB, with various signals (colored noise, speech) and statistics estimated over 500 samples. In this correspondence, we proved that the mixing matrix can be. estimated using fourth-ordercross-cumulants, for two mixtures of two non-Gaussian sources. Solutions are obtained by rooting a fourth-order polynomial equation. Using second-order cross-cumulants allows us to simplify the method; the solution is then obtained by rooting two second-order polynomial equations and gives the result if one source is Gaussian. The methods are then quite simple, but its roots are very sensitive to the accuracy of the estimated cumulants. In fact, this direct solution is less accurate than indirect methods, especially adaptive a l g o r i b s. Moreover, we restricted the study to the separation of two sources, and theoretical solutions for three sources or more seems not easily tractable. However, in the case of two mixtures of two sources, it may give a good starting point with a small computation cost for any adaptive algorithm. REFERENCES J.-F.
