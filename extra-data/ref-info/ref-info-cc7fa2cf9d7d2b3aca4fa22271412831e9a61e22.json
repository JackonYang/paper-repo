                "text": "This thesis describes a vision system which performs face recognition as a specialpurpose visual task, or \"visual behavior\". In addition to performing experiments using stored face images digitized under a range of imaging conditions, I have implemented face recognition in a near-real-time (or \"interactive-time\") computer system which locates and tracks a subject's head and then recognize the person by comparing characteristics of the face to those of known individuals. The computational approach of this system is motivated by both biology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of interactive-time performance and accuracy. The face recognition problem is treated as an intrinsically two-dimensional recognition problem, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. Each view is represented by a set of \"eigenfaces\" which are the significant eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of known faces. They form a holistic representation and do not necessarily correspond to individual features such as eyes, ears, and noses. This approach provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner. In addition to face recognition, I explore other visual behaviors in the domain of human-computer interaction. Thesis Supervisor: Alex P. Pentland Associate Professor, MIT Media Laboratory"

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture."
