In this paper, we strive to build a computational model that predicts the motivation behind the actions of people from images. To our knowledge, this challenging problem has not yet been extensively explored in computer vision. We present a novel learning based framework that uses high-level visual recognition to infer why people are performing an actions in images. However, the information in an image alone may not be sufficient to automatically solve this task. Since humans can rely on their own experiences to infer motivation, we propose to give computer vision systems access to some of these experiences by using recently developed natural language models to mine knowledge stored in massive amounts of text. While we are still far away from automatically inferring motivation, our results suggest that transferring knowledge from language into vision can help machines understand why a person might be performing an action in an image."

                "text": "We present MCTest, a freely available set of stories and associated questions intended for research on the machine comprehension of text. Previous work on machine comprehension (e.g., semantic modeling) has made great strides, but primarily focuses either on limited-domain datasets, or on solving a more restricted goal (e.g., open-domain relation extraction). In contrast, MCTest requires machines to answer multiple-choice reading comprehension questions about fictional stories, directly tackling the high-level goal of open-domain machine comprehension. Reading comprehension can test advanced abilities such as causal reasoning and understanding the world, yet, by being multiple-choice, still provide a clear metric. By being fictional, the answer typically can be found only in the story itself. The stories and questions are also carefully limited to those a young child would understand, reducing the world knowledge that is required for the task. We present the scalable crowd-sourcing methods that allow us to cheaply construct a dataset of 500 stories and 2000 questions. By screening workers (with grammar tests) and stories (with grading), we have ensured that the data is the same quality as another set that we manually edited, but at one tenth the editing cost. By being open-domain, yet carefully restricted, we hope MCTest will serve to encourage research and provide a clear metric for advancement on the machine comprehension of text. 1 Reading Comprehension A major goal for NLP is for machines to be able to understand text as well as people. Several research disciplines are focused on this problem: for example, information extraction, relation extraction, semantic role labeling, and recognizing textual entailment. Yet these techniques are necessarily evaluated individually, rather than by how much they advance us towards the end goal. On the other hand, the goal of semantic parsing is the machine comprehension of text (MCT), yet its evaluation requires adherence to a specific knowledge representation, and it is currently unclear what the best representation is, for open-domain text. We believe that it is useful to directly tackle the top-level task of MCT. For this, we need a way to measure progress. One common method for evaluating someone\u2019s understanding of text is by giving them a multiple-choice reading comprehension test. This has the advantage that it is objectively gradable (vs. essays) yet may test a range of abilities such as causal or counterfactual reasoning, inference among relations, or just basic understanding of the world in which the passage is set. Therefore, we propose a multiple-choice reading comprehension task as a way to evaluate progress on MCT. We have built a reading comprehension dataset containing 500 fictional stories, with 4 multiple choice questions per story. It was built using methods which can easily scale to at least 5000 stories, since the stories were created, and the curation was done, using crowd sourcing almost entirely, at a total of $4.00 per story. We plan to periodically update the dataset to ensure that methods are not overfitting to the existing data. The dataset is open-domain, yet restricted to concepts and words that a 7 year old is expected to understand. This task is still beyond the capability of today\u2019s computers and algorithms."

While it is encouraging to see its potential being tapped, it brings forth a fundamental challenge to the vision researcher: scalability. How can we learn a model for any concept that exhaustively covers all its appearance variations, while requiring minimal or no human supervision for compiling the vocabulary of visual variance, gathering the training images and annotations, and learning the models? In this paper, we introduce a fully-automated approach for learning extensive models for a wide range of variations (e.g. actions, interactions, attributes and beyond) within any concept. Our approach leverages vast resources of online books to discover the vocabulary of variance, and intertwines the data collection and modeling steps to alleviate the need for explicit human supervision in training the models. Our approach organizes the visual knowledge about a concept in a convenient and useful way, enabling a variety of applications across vision and NLP. Our online system has been queried by users to learn models for several interesting concepts including breakfast, Gandhi, beautiful, etc. To date, our system has models available for over 50, 000 variations within 150 concepts, and has annotated more than 10 million images with bounding boxes."

Recent work in Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) circumvents this challenge by describing categories via attributes or text. However, not all visual concepts, e.g., two people dancing, are easily amenable to such descriptions. In this paper, we propose a new modality for ZSL using visual abstraction to learn difficult-to-describe concepts. Specifically, we explore concepts related to people and their interactions with others. Our proposed modality allows one to provide training data by manipulating abstract visualizations, e.g., one can illustrate interactions between two clipart people by manipulating each person\u2019s pose, expression, gaze, and gender. The feasibility of our approach is shown on a human pose dataset and a new dataset containing complex interactions between two people, where we outperform several baselines. To better match across the two domains, we learn an explicit mapping between the abstract and real worlds."

In this paper we learn the visual features that correspond to semantic phrases derived from sentences. Specifically, we extract predicate tuples that contain two nouns and a relation. The relation may take several forms, such as a verb, preposition, adjective or their combination. We model a scene using a Conditional Random Field (CRF) formulation where each node corresponds to an object, and the edges to their relations. We determine the potentials of the CRF using the tuples extracted from the sentences. We generate novel scenes depicting the sentences' visual meaning by sampling from the CRF. The CRF is also used to score a set of scenes for a text-based image retrieval task. Our results show we can generate (retrieve) scenes that convey the desired semantic meaning, even when scenes (queries) are described by multiple sentences. Significant improvement is found over several baseline approaches."

The semantic meaning of images depends on the presence of objects, their attributes and their relations to other objects. But precisely characterizing this dependence requires extracting complex visual information from an image, which is in general a difficult and yet unsolved problem. In this paper, we propose studying semantic information in abstract images created from collections of clip art. Abstract images provide several advantages. They allow for the direct study of how to infer high-level semantic information, since they remove the reliance on noisy low-level object, attribute and relation detectors, or the tedious hand-labeling of images. Importantly, abstract images also allow the ability to generate sets of semantically similar scenes. Finding analogous sets of semantically similar real images would be nearly impossible. We create 1,002 sets of 10 semantically similar abstract scenes with corresponding written descriptions. We thoroughly analyze this dataset to discover semantically important features, the relations of words to visual features and methods for measuring semantic similarity."

Our approach can handle human questions of high complexity about realistic scenes and replies with range of answer like counts, object classes, instances and lists of them. The system is directly trained from question-answer pairs. We establish a first benchmark for this task that can be seen as a modern attempt at a visual turing test."

In this work, we propose to look beyond the visible elements of a scene; we demonstrate that a scene is not just a collection of objects and their configuration or the labels assigned to its pixels - it is so much more. From a simple observation of a scene, we can tell a lot about the environment surrounding the scene such as the potential establishments near it, the potential crime rate in the area, or even the economic climate. Here, we explore several of these aspects from both the human perception and computer vision perspective. Specifically, we show that it is possible to predict the distance of surrounding establishments such as McDonald's or hospitals even by using scenes located far from them. We go a step further to show that both humans and computers perform well at navigating the environment based only on visual cues from scenes. Lastly, we show that it is possible to predict the crime rates in an area simply by looking at a scene without any real-time criminal activity. Simply put, here, we illustrate that it is possible to look beyond the visible scene."

                "text": "Significance In computer vision, as in other fields of artificial intelligence, the methods of evaluation largely define the scientific effort. Most current evaluations measure detection accuracy, emphasizing the classification of regions according to objects from a predefined library. But detection is not the same as understanding. We present here a different evaluation system, in which a query engine prepares a written test (\u201cvisual Turing test\u201d) that uses binary questions to probe a system\u2019s ability to identify attributes and relationships in addition to recognizing objects. Today, computer vision systems are tested by their accuracy in detecting and localizing instances of objects. As an alternative, and motivated by the ability of humans to provide far richer descriptions and even tell a story about an image, we construct a \u201cvisual Turing test\u201d: an operator-assisted device that produces a stochastic sequence of binary questions from a given test image. The query engine proposes a question; the operator either provides the correct answer or rejects the question as ambiguous; the engine proposes the next question (\u201cjust-in-time truthing\u201d). The test is then administered to the computer-vision system, one question at a time. After the system\u2019s answer is recorded, the system is provided the correct answer and the next question. Parsing is trivial and deterministic; the system being tested requires no natural language processing. The query engine employs statistical constraints, learned from a training set, to produce questions with essentially unpredictable answers\u2014the answer to a question, given the history of questions and their correct answers, is nearly equally likely to be positive or negative. In this sense, the test is only about vision. The system is designed to produce streams of questions that follow natural story lines, from the instantiation of a unique object, through an exploration of its properties, and on to its relationships with other uniquely instantiated objects."

Most approaches use co-occurrence of \"nouns\" and image features over large datasets to determine the correspondence, but many correspondence ambiguities remain. We further constrain the correspondence problem by exploiting additional language constructs to improve the learning process from weakly labeled data. We consider both \"prepositions\" and \"comparative adjectives\" which are used to express relationships between objects. If the models of such relationships can be determined, they help resolve correspondence ambiguities. However, learning models of these relationships requires solving the correspondence problem. We simultaneously learn the visual features defining \"nouns\" and the differential visual features defining such \"binary-relationships\" using an EM-based approach."

To drive computational visual recognition toward more human-centric outputs, we need a better understanding of how people perceive and judge the importance of content in images. In this paper, we explore how a number of factors relate to human perception of importance. Proposed factors fall into 3 broad types: 1) factors related to composition, e.g. size, location, 2) factors related to semantics, e.g. category of object or scene, and 3) contextual factors related to the likelihood of attribute-object, or object-scene pairs. We explore these factors using what people describe as a proxy for importance. Finally, we build models to predict what will be described about an image given either known image content, or image content estimated automatically by recognition systems."

Memory networks reason with inference components combined with a long-term memory component; they learn how to use these jointly. The long-term memory can be read and written to, with the goal of using it for prediction. We investigate these models in the context of question answering (QA) where the long-term memory effectively acts as a (dynamic) knowledge base, and the output is a textual response. We evaluate them on a large-scale QA task, and a smaller, but more complex, toy task generated from a simulated world. In the latter, we show the reasoning power of such models by chaining multiple supporting sentences to answer questions that require understanding the intension of verbs."

NEIL uses a semi-supervised learning algorithm that jointly discovers common sense relationships (e.g., \"Corolla is a kind of/looks similar to Car\", \"Wheel is a part of Car\") and labels instances of the given visual categories. It is an attempt to develop the world's largest visual structured knowledge base with minimum human labeling effort. As of 10th October 2013, NEIL has been continuously running for 2.5 months on 200 core cluster (more than 350K CPU hours) and has an ontology of 1152 object categories, 1034 scene categories and 87 attributes. During this period, NEIL has discovered more than 1700 relationships and has labeled more than 400K visual instances."

In the process, we make use of enormous amounts of commonsense knowledge about how the world works. In this paper, we investigate learning this commonsense knowledge from data. To overcome a lack of densely annotated spatiotemporal data, we learn from sequences of abstract images gathered using crowd-sourcing. The abstract scenes provide both object location and attribute information. We demonstrate qualitatively and quantitatively that our models produce plausible scene predictions on both the abstract images, as well as natural images taken from the Internet."

We describe and evaluate our first fielded system, which enabled the construction of a 450,000 assertion commonsense knowledge base. We then discuss how our second-generation system addresses weaknesses discovered in the first.

Our novel approach \u201cimagines\u201d an actor performing an action typical for the target object class, instead of relying purely on the visual object appearance. So, function is handled as a cue complementary to appearance, rather than being a consideration after appearance-based detection. Experimental results are given for the functional category \u201csitting\u201d. Such affordance is tested on a 3d representation of the scene, as can be realistically obtained through SfM or depth cameras. In contrast to appearance-based object detectors, affordance detection requires only very few training examples and generalizes very well to other sittable objects like benches or sofas when trained on a few chairs."

Most of the previous work casts this problem as a classification task where separate classifiers are trained to label objects, recognize attributes, or assign affordances. In this work, we consider the problem of object affordance reasoning using a knowledge base representation. Diverse information of objects are first harvested from images and other meta-data sources. We then learn a knowledge base (KB) using a Markov Logic Network (MLN). Given the learned KB, we show that a diverse set of visual inference tasks can be done in this unified framework without training separate classifiers, including zero-shot affordance prediction and object recognition given human poses."

The potential benefit from this source is made more significant due to the enormous amount of language data easily available today. We present a system to automatically generate natural language descriptions from images that exploits both statistics gleaned from parsing large quantities of text data and recognition algorithms from computer vision. The system is very effective at producing relevant sentences for images. It also generates descriptions that are notably more true to the specific image content than previous work."

Our main contribution is COSTA, which exploits co-occurrences of visual concepts in images for knowledge transfer. These inter-dependencies arise naturally between concepts, and are easy to obtain from existing annotations or web-search hit counts. We estimate a classifier for a new label, as a weighted combination of related classes, using the co-occurrences to define the weight. We propose various metrics to leverage these co-occurrences, and a regression model for learning a weight for each related class. We also show that our zero-shot classifiers can serve as priors for few-shot learning. Experiments on three multi-labeled datasets reveal that our proposed zero-shot methods, are approaching and occasionally outperforming fully supervised SVMs. We conclude that co-occurrence statistics suffice for zero-shot classification."

Especially question answering systems have received wide attention, as they allow users to express arbitrarily complex information needs in an easy and intuitive fashion (for an overview see [4]). The key challenge lies in translating the users' information needs into a form such that they can be evaluated using standard Semantic Web query processing and inferencing techniques. Over the past years, a range of approaches have been developed to address this challenge, showing signicant advances towards answering natural language questions with respect to large, heterogeneous sets of structured data. However, only few systems yet address the fact that the structured data available nowadays is distributed among a large collection of interconnected datasets, and that answers to questions can often only be provided if information from several sources are combined. In addition, a lot of information is still available only in textual form, both on the web and in the form of labels and abstracts in linked data sources. Therefore approaches are needed that can not only deal with the specific character of structured data but also with finding information in several sources, processing both structured and unstructured information, and combining such gathered information into one answer. The main objective of the open challenge on question answering over linked data (QALD) is to provide up-to-date, demanding benchmarks that establish a standard against which question answering systems over structured data can be evaluated and compared. QALD-4 is the fourth instalment of the QALD open challenge, comprising three tasks: multilingual question answering, biomedical question answering over interlinked data, and hybrid question answering."

By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. \n \nAn inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of \"Canada\" and \"Air\" cannot be easily combined to obtain \"Air Canada\".

Convolutional Neural Nets (CNN) have been shown to perform very well on large scale object recognition problems. In the context of attribute classification, however, the signal is often subtle and it may cover only a small part of the image, while the image is dominated by the effects of pose and viewpoint. Discounting for pose variation would require training on very large labeled datasets which are not presently available. Part-based models, such as poselets [4] and DPM [12] have been shown to perform well for this problem but they are limited by shallow low-level features. We propose a new method which combines part-based models and deep learning by training pose-normalized CNNs. We show substantial improvement vs. state-of-the-art methods on challenging attribute classification tasks in unconstrained settings. Experiments confirm that our method outperforms both the best part-based methods on this problem and conventional CNNs trained on the full bounding box of the person."

The evaluation of computer-generated text is a notoriously difficult problem, however, the quality of image descriptions has typically been measured using unigram BLEU and human judgements. The focus of this paper is to determine the correlation of automatic measures with human judgements for this task. We estimate the correlation of unigram and Smoothed BLEU, TER, ROUGE-SU4, and Meteor against human judgements on two data sets. The main finding is that unigram BLEU has a weak correlation, and Meteor has the strongest correlation with human judgements."

                "text": "The TREC 2005 Question Answering track contained three tasks: the main question answering task, the document ranking task, and the relationship task. The main task was the same as the single TREC 2004 QA task. In the main task, question series were used to define a set of targets. Eac h series was about a single target and contained factoid and list questions. The final question in the series was an \u201cOt her\u201d question that asked for additional information about the target that was not covered by previous questions in the series. The document ranking task was to return a ranked list of documents for each question from a subset of the questions in the main task, where the documents were thought to contain an answer to the question. In the relationship tas k, systems were given TREC-like topic statements that ended with a question asking for evidence for a particular relationship. The goal of the TREC question answering (QA) track is to foster research on systems that return answers themselves, rather than documents containing answers, in response to a question. The track started in TREC-8 (1999), with the first several editions of the track focused on factoid questions. A factoid question is a fact-based, short answer question such as How many calories are there in a Big Mac? . The task in the TREC 2003 QA track was a combined task that contained list and definition questions in additio n to factoid questions [1]. A list question asks for differen t instances of a particular kind of information to be returned , such as List the names of chewing gums . Answering such questions requires a system to assemble an answer from information located in multiple documents. A definition question asks for interesting information about a particul ar person or thing such as Who is Vlad the Impaler?or What is a golden parachute?. Definition questions also require systems to locate inform ation in multiple documents, but in this case the information of interest is much less crisply de lineated. The TREC 2004 test set contained factoid and list questions grouped into different series, where each series had the target of a definition associated with it [2]. Each questi on in a series asked for some information about the target. In addition, the final question in each series was an explicit \u201cOther\u201d question, which was to be interpreted as \u201cTell me other interesting things about this target I don\u2019t know enou gh to ask directly\u201d. This last question is roughly equivalen t to the definition questions in the TREC 2003 task. Several concerns regarding the TREC 2005 QA track were raised during the TREC 2004 QA breakout session. Since the TREC 2004 task was rather different from previous years\u2019 tasks, there was the desire to repeat the task largely unchanged. There was also the desire to build infrastructure that would allow a closer examination of the role document retrieval techniques play in supporting QA technology. As a result of this discussion, the main task for the 2005 QA track was decided to be essentially the same as the 2004 task in that the test set would consist of a set of questio n series where each series asks for information regarding a particular target. As in TREC 2004, the targets included people, organizations, and other entities (things); unlike TREC 2004 the target could also be an event. Events were added since the document set from which the answers are to be drawn are newswire articles. The runs were evaluated using the same methodology as in TREC 2004, except that the primary measure was the per-series score instead of the combined component score. The document ranking task was added to the TREC 2005 track to address the concern regarding document retrieval and QA. The task was to submit, for a subset of 50 of the questions in the main task, a ranked list of up to 1000 documents for each question. Groups whose primary emphasis was document retrieval rather than QA, were allowed to participate in the document ranking task without submitting actual answers for the main task. However, all TREC 2005 submissions to the main task were required to include a ranked list of documents for each question in the document"

Designing and comparing feature descriptors requires the ability to evaluate their performance with respect to those transformations. We want to know how robust the descriptors are to changes in the lighting, scene, or viewing conditions. For this, we need ground truth data of different scenes viewed under different camera or lighting conditions in a controlled way. Such data is very difficult to gather in a real-world setting. We propose using a photorealistic virtual world to gain complete and repeatable control of the environment in order to evaluate image features. We calibrate our virtual world evaluations by comparing against feature rankings made from photographic data of the same subject matter (the Statue of Liberty). We find very similar feature rankings between the two datasets. We then use our virtual world to study the effects on descriptor performance of controlled changes in viewpoint and illumination. We also study the effect of augmenting the descriptors with depth information to improve performance."

Classic work suggests that people\u2019s intuitive models of physics are relatively poor and error-prone, based on highly simplified heuristics that apply only in special cases or incorrect general principles (e.g., impetus instead of momentum). These conclusions seem at odds with the breadth and sophistication of naive physical reasoning in real-world situations. Our work measures the boundaries of people\u2019s physical reasoning and tests the richness of intuitive physics knowledge in more complex scenes. We asked participants to make quantitative judgments about stability and other physical properties of virtual 3D towers. We found their judgments correlated highly with a model observer that uses simulations based on realistic physical dynamics and sampling-based approximate probabilistic inference to efficiently and accurately estimate these properties. Several alternative heuristic accounts provide substantially worse fits."

We investigate this somewhat philosophical question using computer vision and machine learning techniques. We explore three methods by which we might detect Time's Arrow in video sequences, based on distinct ways in which motion in video sequences might be asymmetric in time. We demonstrate good video forwards/backwards classification results on a selection of YouTube video clips, and on natively-captured sequences (with no temporally-dependent video compression), and examine what motions the models have learned that help discriminate forwards from backwards time."

                "text": "We present an approach which exploits the coupling between human actions and scene geometry to use human pose as a cue for single-view 3D scene understanding. Our method builds upon recent advances in still-image pose estimation to extract functional and geometric constraints on the scene. These constraints are then used to improve single-view 3D scene understanding approaches. The proposed method is validated on monocular time-lapse sequences from YouTube and still images of indoor scenes gathered from the Internet. We demonstrate that observing people performing different actions can significantly improve estimates of 3D scene geometry."

Tenenbaum (jbt@mit.edu) Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, MIT. Cambridge, MA 02139 Abstract Many human activities require precise judgments about the physical properties and dynamics of multiple objects. Clas- sic work suggests that people\u2019s intuitive models of physics are relatively poor and error-prone, based on highly simplified heuristics that apply only in special cases or incorrect general principles (e.g., impetus instead of momentum). These con- clusions seem at odds with the breadth and sophistication of naive physical reasoning in real-world situations. Our work measures the boundaries of people\u2019s physical reasoning and tests the richness of intuitive physics knowledge in more com- plex scenes. We asked participants to make quantitative judg- ments about stability and other physical properties of virtual 3D towers. We found their judgments correlated highly with a model observer that uses simulations based on realistic phys- ical dynamics and sampling-based approximate probabilistic inference to efficiently and accurately estimate these proper- ties. Several alternative heuristic accounts provide substan- tially worse fits. Keywords: intuitive physics, dynamics, per- ception, model Introduction Intuitive physics is a core domain of common-sense reason- ing, developing early in infancy and central in adult thought (Baillargeon, 2007). Yet, despite decades of research, there is no consensus on certain basic questions: What kinds of inter- nal models of the physical world do human minds build? How rich and physically accurate are they? How is intuitive phys- ical knowledge represented or used to guide physical judg- ments? The kinds of judgments we consider are those necessary to navigate, interact with, and constructively modify real-world physical environments. Consider the towers of blocks shown in Fig. 1. How stable are these configurations, or how likely are they to fall? If they fall, in what direction will the blocks scatter? Where could a block be added or removed from the tower to significantly alter the configuration\u2019s stability? Peo- ple make such judgments with relative ease, yet the literature on intuitive physics has little to say about how they do so. Classic research focused on the limits of human physical reasoning. One line of work argued that people\u2019s understand- ing of simple object trajectories moving under inertial dynam- ics was biased away from the true Newtonian dynamics, to- wards a more \u201cAristotelian\u201d or \u201cimpetus\u201d kinematic theory (Caramazza, McCloskey, & Green, 1981; McCloskey, 1983), yet no precise model of an intuitive impetus theory was de- veloped. Studies of how people judge relative masses in two- body collisions concluded that humans are limited to mak- ing physical judgments based on simple heuristics, or become confused in tasks requiring attention to more than one dimen- sion of a dynamic scene (Todd & Jr., 1982; Gilden & Proffitt, 1989a, 1989b, 1994). Neither the impetus accounts nor the simple one-dimensional heuristic accounts attempted to ex- plain how people might reason about complex scenes such as A. B. C. Figure 1: Three towers of varying height and stability. Each tower (A, B, C) corresponds to a colored point in Fig. 3. A is clearly unstable, C clearly stable, while B (matched in height to C) is less obvious. Fig. 1, or gave any basis to think people might reason about them with a high degree of accuracy. Here we argue for a different view. We hypothesize that humans can make physical judgments using an internal gen- erative model that approximates the principles of Newtonian mechanics applied to three-dimensional solid bodies. They use this model to forward-simulate future outcomes given be- liefs about the world state, and make judgments based on the outcomes of these simulations. We believe that only by posit- ing such rich internal models can we explain how people are able to perform complex everyday tasks like constructing and predicting properties of stacks of objects, balancing or stabi- lizing precariously arranged objects, or intercepting or avoid- ing multiple moving, interacting objects. The physical laws of the internal models we propose are es- sentially deterministic, but people\u2019s judgments are probabilis- tic. Capturing that probabilistic structure is crucial for pre- dicting human judgments precisely and explaining how intu- itive physical reasoning successfully guides adaptive behav- ior, decision-making and planning in the world. We can in- corporate uncertainty in several ways. Objects\u2019 positions and velocities and their key physical properties (e.g., mass, coeffi- cients of friction) may only be inferred with limited precision from perceptual input. People may also be uncertain about the underlying physical dynamics, or may consider the action of unobserved or unknown exogenous forces on the objects in the scene (e.g., a gust of wind, or someone bumping into the table). We can represent these sources of uncertainty in terms of probability distributions over the values of state vari- ables, parameters or latent forces in the deterministic physi- cal model. By representing these distributions approximately in terms of small sets of samples, uncertainty can be propa- gated through the model\u2019s physical dynamics using only ana- log mental simulations. Thus a resource-bounded observer"

Following 2013 edition, the data set has been extracted from actual uni- versity entrance examinations including a variety of topics and question types. Systems receive a set of Multiple-Choice Reading Comprehension tests where the task is to select the correct answer among a finite set of candidates, accord- ing to the given text. Questions are designed originally for testing human exam- inees, rather than evaluating computer systems. Therefore, the data set chal- lenges human ability to show their understanding of texts. Thus, questions and answers are lexically distant from their supporting excerpts in text, requiring not only a high degree of textual inference, but also the development of strate- gies for selecting the correct answer. As a novelty this year, data sets originally in English were manually translated into Russian, French, Spanish and Italian."

Previous experiments with context have mostly been done on home-grown datasets, often with non-standard baselines, making it difficult to isolate the contribution of contextual information. In this work, we present our analysis on a standard dataset, using top-performing local appearance detectors as baseline. We evaluate several different sources of context and ways to utilize it. While we employ many contextual cues that have been used before, we also propose a few novel ones including the use of geographic context and a new approach for using object spatial support."

In particular, we propose an approach and a set of design principles for such an agent, describe a partial implementation of such a system that has already learned to extract a knowledge base containing over 242,000 beliefs with an estimated precision of 74% after running for 67 days, and discuss lessons learned from this preliminary attempt to build a never-ending learning agent."

This setup has hardly been studied in computer vision research, but it is the rule rather than the exception, because the world contains tens of thousands of different object classes and for only a very few of them image, collections have been formed and annotated with suitable class labels. In this paper, we tackle the problem by introducing attribute-based classification. It performs object detection based on a human-specified high-level description of the target objects instead of training images. The description consists of arbitrary semantic attributes, like shape, color or even geographic information. Because such properties transcend the specific learning task at hand, they can be pre-learned, e.g. from image datasets unrelated to the current task. Afterwards, new classes can be detected based on their attribute representation, without the need for a new training phase. In order to evaluate our method and to facilitate research in this area, we have assembled a new large-scale dataset, \u201cAnimals with Attributes\u201d, of over 30,000 animal images that match the 50 classes in Osherson's classic table of how strongly humans associate 85 semantic attributes with animal classes. Our experiments show that by using an attribute layer it is indeed possible to build a learning object detection system that does not require any training images of the target classes."

Both can quickly and accurately predict the 3D positions of body joints from a single depth image without using any temporal information. The key to both approaches is the use of a large, realistic, and highly varied synthetic set of training images. This allows us to learn models that are largely invariant to factors such as pose, body shape, field-of-view cropping, and clothing. Our first approach employs an intermediate body parts representation, designed so that an accurate per-pixel classification of the parts will localize the joints of the body. The second approach instead directly regresses the positions of body joints. By using simple depth pixel comparison features and parallelizable decision forests, both approaches can run super-real time on consumer hardware. Our evaluation investigates many aspects of our methods, and compares the approaches to each other and to the state of the art. Results on silhouettes suggest broader applicability to other imaging modalities."

Not only do these features generalize poorly, but the cost of feature computation restricts parsing speed significantly. In this work, we propose a novel way of learning a neural network classifier for use in a greedy, transition-based dependency parser. Because this classifier learns and uses just a small number of dense features, it can work very fast, while achieving an about 2% improvement in unlabeled and labeled attachment scores on both English and Chinese datasets. Concretely, our parser is able to parse more than 1000 sentences per second at 92.2% unlabeled attachment score on the English Penn Treebank."

This information is traditionally provided through dictionaries, and machine-readable dictionaries are now widely available. But dictionary entries evolved for the convenience of human readers, not for machines. WordNet1 provides a more effective combination of traditional lexicographic information and modern computing. WordNet is an online lexical database designed for use under program control. English nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are organized into sets of synonyms, each representing a lexicalized concept. Semantic relations link the synonym sets [4]."

The project extracts knowledge from 111 different language editions of Wikipedia. The largest DBpedia knowledge base which is extracted from the English edition of Wikipedia consists of over 400 million facts that describe 3.7 million things. The DBpedia knowledge bases that are extracted from the other 110 Wikipedia editions together consist of 1.46 billion facts and describe 10 million additional things. The DBpedia project maps Wikipedia infoboxes from 27 different language editions to a single shared ontology consisting of 320 classes and 1,650 properties. The mappings are created via a world-wide crowd-sourcing effort and enable knowledge from the different Wikipedia editions to be combined. The project publishes releases of all DBpedia knowledge bases for download and provides SPARQL query access to 14 out of the 111 language editions via a global network of local DBpedia chapters. In addition to the regular releases, the project maintains a live knowledge base which is updated whenever a page in Wikipedia changes. DBpedia sets 27 million RDF links pointing into over 30 external data sources and thus enables data from these sources to be used together with DBpedia data. Several hundred data sets on the Web publish RDF links pointing to DBpedia themselves and make DBpedia one of the central interlinking hubs in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud. In this system report, we give an overview of the DBpedia community project, including its architecture, technical implementation, maintenance, internationalisation, usage statistics and applications."

We utilize a simple observation that, by human design, objects in static scenes should be stable with respect to gravity. This assumption is applicable to all scene categories and poses useful constraints for the plausible interpretations (parses) in scene understanding. Our method consists of two major steps: 1) geometric reasoning: recovering solid 3D volumetric primitives from defective point cloud, and 2) physical reasoning: grouping the unstable primitives to physically stable objects by optimizing the stability and the scene prior. We propose to use a novel disconnectivity graph (DG) to represent the energy landscape and use a Swendsen-Wang Cut (MCMC) method for optimization. In experiments, we demonstrate that the algorithm achieves substantially better performance for i) object segmentation, ii) 3D volumetric recovery of the scene, and iii) better parsing result for scene understanding in comparison to state-of-the-art methods in both public dataset and our own new dataset."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

Using the \"chair\" class as a running example, we propose an exemplar-based 3D category representation, which can explicitly model chairs of different styles as well as the large variation in viewpoint. We develop an approach to establish part-based correspondences between 3D CAD models and real photographs. This is achieved by (i) representing each 3D model using a set of view-dependent mid-level visual elements learned from synthesized views in a discriminative fashion, (ii) carefully calibrating the individual element detectors on a common dataset of negative images, and (iii) matching visual elements to the test image allowing for small mutual deformations but preserving the viewpoint and style constraints. We demonstrate the ability of our system to align 3D models with 2D objects in the challenging PASCAL VOC images, which depict a wide variety of chairs in complex scenes."

We show that exploiting the box like geometric structure of furniture and constraints provided by the scene, allows us to recover the extent of major furniture objects in 3D. Our \u201cboxy\u201d detector localizes box shaped objects oriented parallel to the scene across different scales and object types, and thus blocks out the occupied space in the scene. To localize the objects more accurately in 3D we introduce a set of specially designed features that capture the floor contact points of the objects. Image based metrics are not very indicative of performance in 3D. We make the first attempt to evaluate single view based occupancy estimates for 3D errors and propose several task driven performance measures towards it. On our dataset of 592 indoor images marked with full 3D geometry of the scene, we show that: (a) our detector works well using image based metrics; (b) our refinement method produces significant improvements in localization in 3D; and (c) if one evaluates using 3D metrics, our method offers major improvements over other single view based scene geometry estimation methods."

The emergence of vast amounts of geographically-calibrated image data is a great reason for computer vision to start looking globally - on the scale of the entire planet! In this paper, we propose a simple algorithm for estimating a distribution over geographic locations from a single image using a purely data-driven scene matching approach. For this task, we leverage a dataset of over 6 million GPS-tagged images from the Internet. We represent the estimated image location as a probability distribution over the Earthpsilas surface. We quantitatively evaluate our approach in several geolocation tasks and demonstrate encouraging performance (up to 30 times better than chance). We show that geolocation estimates can provide the basis for numerous other image understanding tasks such as population density estimation, land cover estimation or urban/rural classification."

To overcome this lack of training data for certain classes, we propose a novel way of augmenting the training data for each class by borrowing and transforming examples from other classes. Our model learns which training instances from other classes to borrow and how to transform the borrowed examples so that they become more similar to instances from the target class. Our experimental results demonstrate that our new object detector, with borrowed and transformed examples, improves upon the current state-of-the-art detector on the challenging SUN09 object detection dataset."

SVMLight is the only publicly available software for RankSVM. It is slow and, due to incomplete training with it, previous evaluations show RankSVM to have inferior ranking performance. We propose new methods based on primal Newton method to speed up RankSVM training and show that they are 5 orders of magnitude faster than SVMLight.

In many situations, one could benefit from additional high-probability solutions. Current methods for computing the M most probable configurations produce solutions that tend to be very similar to the MAP solution and each other. This is often an undesirable property. In this paper we propose an algorithm for the Diverse M-Best problem, which involves finding a diverse set of highly probable solutions under a discrete probabilistic model. Given a dissimilarity function measuring closeness of two solutions, our formulation involves maximizing a linear combination of the probability and dissimilarity to previous solutions. Our formulation generalizes the M-Best MAP problem and we show that for certain families of dissimilarity functions we can guarantee that these solutions can be found as easily as the MAP solution."
