                "text": "Human motion analysis is a very important task for computer vision with many potential applications. There are several problems in human motion analysis: detection, tracking, and activity interpretation. Detection is the most fundamental problem of the three, but remains untackled due to its inherent difficulty. This thesis develops a solution to the problem. It is based on a learned probabilistic model of the joint positions and velocities of the body parts, where detection and labeling are performed by hypothesis testing on the maximum a posterior estimate of the pose and motion of the body. To achieve efficiency in learning and testing, a graphical model is used to approximate the conditional independence of human motion. This model is also shown to provide a natural way to deal with clutter and occlusion. One key factor in the proposed method is the probabilistic model of human motion. In this thesis, an unsupervised learning algorithm that can obtain the probabilistic model automatically from unlabeled training data is presented. The training data include useful foreground features as well as features that arise from irrelevant background clutter. The correspondence between parts and detected features is also unknown in the training data. To learn the best model structure as well as model parameters, a variant of the EM algorithm is developed where the labeling of the data (part assignments) is treated as hidden variables. We explore two classes of graphical models: trees and decomposable triangulated graphs and find that the later are superior for our application. To better model human motion, we also consider the case when the model consists of mixtures of decomposable triangulated graphs. The efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm have been demonstrated by applying it to generate models of human motion automatically from unlabeled image sequences, and testing the learned models on a variety of sequences. We find detection rates of over 95% on pairs of frames. This is very promising for building a real-life system, for example, a pedestrian detector."

Loose and textured clothing, occlusion and scene clutter make it a difficult problem because bottom-up segmentation and grouping do not always work. We address the problem of detecting humans from their motion pattern in monocular image sequences; extraneous motions and occlusion may be present. We assume that we may not rely on segmentation or grouping and that the vision front-end is limited to observing the motion of key points and textured patches in between pairs of frames. We do not assume that we are able to track features for more than two frames. Our method is based on learning an approximate probabilistic model of the joint position and velocity of different body features. Detection is performed by hypothesis testing on the maximum a posteriori estimate of the pose and motion of the body. Our experiments on a dozen of walking sequences indicate that our algorithm is accurate and efficient."

We focus on a particular type of model where objects are represented as flexible constellations of rigid parts (features). The variability within a class is represented by a joint probability density function (pdf) on the shape of the constellation and the output of part detectors. In a first stage, the method automatically identifies distinctive parts in the training set by applying a clustering algorithm to patterns selected by an interest operator. It then learns the statistical shape model using expectation maximization. The method achieves very good classification results on human faces and rear views of cars."

Algorithms have been developed for tracking the body; however, initialization is done by hand. We propose a method for detecting a moving human body and for labeling its parts automatically in scenes that include extraneous motions and occlusion. We assume a Johansson display, i.e., that a number of moving features, some representing the unoccluded body joints and some belonging to the background, are supplied in the scene. Our method is based on maximizing the joint probability density function (PDF) of the position and velocity of the body parts. The PDF is estimated from training data. Dynamic programming is used for calculating efficiently the best global labeling on an approximation of the PDF. Detection is performed by hypothesis testing on the best labeling found. The computational cost is on the order of N4 where N is the number of features detected. We explore the performance of our method with experiments carried on a variety of periodic and nonperiodic body motions viewed monocularly for a total of approximately 30,000 frames. The algorithm is demonstrated to be accurate and efficient."

We address this problem with mixtures of trees, and demonstrate an efficient and compact representation of this mixture, which admits simple learning and inference algorithms. We use this method to build an automated tracker for Muybridge sequences of a variety of human activities. Tracking is difficult, because the temporal dependencies rule out simple inference methods. We show how to use our model for efficient inference, using a method that employs alternate spatial and temporal inference. The result is a cracker that (a) uses a very loose motion model, and so can track many different activities at a variable frame rate and (b) is entirely, automatic."

The kinematic of the person model is given by a homogeneous transformation tree and its body parts are modeled by right-elliptical cones. The values of a varying number of degrees of freedom (DOFs; body joints, position, and orientation of the person relative to the camera) can be determined according to the application and the kind of image sequence. The determination of the DOFs is understood as an estimation problem which is solved by an iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF). For this purpose, the person model is augmented by a simple motion model of constant velocity for all DOFs which is used in the prediction step of the IEKF. In the update step, both region and edge information are used. Various experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our approach."

We introduce the use of a novel mathematical technique, the product of exponential maps and twist motions, and its integration into a differential motion estimation. This results in solving simple linear systems, and enables us to recover robustly the kinematic degrees-of-freedom in noise and complex self occluded configurations. We demonstrate this on several image sequences of people doing articulated full body movements, and visualize the results in re-animating an artificial 3D human model. We are also able to recover and re-animate the famous movements of Eadweard Muybridge's motion studies from the last century. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computer vision based system that is able to process such challenging footage and recover complex motions with such high accuracy."

Such motion patterns in animals and men are termed here as biological motion. They are characterized by a far higher degree of complexity than the patterns of simple mechanical motions usually studied in our laboratories. In everyday perceptions, the visual information from biological motion and from the corresponding figurative contour patterns (the shape of the body) are intermingled. A method for studying information from the motion pattern per se without interference with the form aspect was devised. In short, the motion of the living body was represented by a few bright spots describing the motions of the main joints. It is found that 10\u201312 such elements in adequate motion combinations in proximal stimulus evoke a compelling impression of human walking, running, dancing, etc. The kinetic-geometric model for visual vector analysis originally developed in the study of perception of motion combinations of the mechanical type was applied to these biological motion patterns. The validity of this model in the present context was experimentally tested and the results turned out to be highly positive."

We present efficient algorithms for learning mixtures-of-trees models in maximum likelihood and Bayesian frameworks. We also discuss additional efficiencies that can be obtained when data are \"sparse,\" and we present data structures and algorithms that exploit such sparseness. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the model for both density estimation and classification. We also discuss the sense in which tree-based classifiers perform an implicit form of feature selection, and demonstrate a resulting insensitivity to irrelevant attributes."

Bayesian model-selection attempts to find the MAP model and use its structure to answer these questions. However, when the amount of available data is modest, there might be many models that have non-negligible posterior. Thus, we want compute the Bayesian posterior of a feature, i.e., the total posterior probability of all models that contain it. In this paper, we propose a new approach for this task. We first show how to efficiently compute a sum over the exponential number of networks that are consistent with a fixed ordering over network variables. This allows us to compute, for a given ordering, both the marginal probability of the data and the posterior of a feature. We then use this result as the basis for an algorithm that approximates the Bayesian posterior of a feature. Our approach uses an Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, but over orderings rather than over network structures. The space of orderings is much smaller and more regular than the space of structures, and has a smoother posterior \"landscape\". We present empirical results on synthetic and real-life datasets that compare our approach to full model averaging (when possible), to MCMC over network structures, and to a non-Bayesian bootstrap approach."

Previous systems have been available to do this for specially illuminated objects or for naturally illuminated but polyhedral objects. Other systems have been able to track nonpolyhedral objects in motion, in some cases from live video, but following only centroids or key-points rather than tracking whole curves. The system described here can track accurately the curved silhouettes of moving non-polyhedral objects at frame-rate, for example hands, lips, legs, vehicles, fruit, and without any special hardware beyond a desktop workstation and a video-camera and framestore. The new algorithms are a synthesis of methods in deformable models, B-splines curve representation and control theory. This paper shows how such a facility can be used to turn parts of the body\u2014for instance, hands and lips\u2014into input devices. Rigid motion of a hand can be used as a 3D mouse with non-rigid gestures signalling a button press or the \u201clifting\u201d of the mouse. Both rigid and non-rigid motions of lips can be tracked independently and used as inputs, for example to animate a computer-generated face."

Like the first edition,this text can also be used for self-study by technical professionals since it discusses engineering issues in algorithm design as well as the mathematical aspects. \nIn its new edition,Introduction to Algorithms continues to provide a comprehensive introduction to the modern study of algorithms. The revision has been updated to reflect changes in the years since the book's original publication. New chapters on the role of algorithms in computing and on probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms have been included. Sections throughout the book have been rewritten for increased clarity,and material has been added wherever a fuller explanation has seemed useful or new information warrants expanded coverage. \nAs in the classic first edition,this new edition of Introduction to Algorithms presents a rich variety of algorithms and covers them in considerable depth while making their design and analysis accessible to all levels of readers. Further,the algorithms are presented in pseudocode to make the book easily accessible to students from all programming language backgrounds. \nEach chapter presents an algorithm,a design technique,an application area,or a related topic. The chapters are not dependent on one another,so the instructor can organize his or her use of the book in the way that best suits the course's needs. Additionally,the new edition offers a 25% increase over the first edition in the number of problems,giving the book 155 problems and over 900 exercises thatreinforcethe concepts the students are learning."
