This algorithm succeeds in efficiently learning r-of-A: threshold functions by choosing hypotheses from a larger class of Boolean functions. WINNOW 1 and WINNOW 2 are natural algorithms for parallel implementation; Slade (1987) has implemented WINNOW on the Connection Machine."

Our goals are to prove results and develop general techniques that shed light on the boundary between the classes of expressions that are learnable in polynomial time and those that are apparently not. The elucidation of this boundary, for boolean expressions and possibly other knowledge representations, is an example of the potential contribution of complexity theory to artificial intelligence. We employ the distribution-free model of learning introduced in /lo]. A more complete discussion and justification of this model can be found in [4,10,11,12]. [4] includes some discussion that is relevant more particularly to infinite representations, such as geometric ones, rather than the finite case of boolean functions. For other recent related work see [1,2,7,&g]. The results of this paper fall into three categories: closure properties of learnable classes, negative results, and distribution-specific positive results. The closure properties are of two kinds. In section 3 we discuss closure under boolean operations on the members of the learnable classes. The assumption that the classes are learnable from positive or negative ex-"

Our model is related to Valiant\u2032s PAC learning model, but does not require the hypotheses used for prediction to be represented in any specified form. In our main result we show how to construct prediction strategies that are optimal to within a constant factor for any reasonable class F of target functions. This result is based on new combinatorial results about classes of functions of finite VC dimension. We also discuss more computationally efficient algorithms for predicting indicator functions of axis-parallel rectangles, more general intersection closed concept classes, and halfspaces in Rn. These are also optimal to within a constant factor. Finally, we compare the general performance of prediction strategies derived by our method to that of those derived from methods in PAC learning theory."

Our methods lead to a unified treatment of some of Valiant's results, along with previous results of Pearl and Devroye and Wagner on distribution-free convergence of certain pattern recognition algorithms. We show that the essential condition for distribution-free learnability is finiteness of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, a simple combinatorial parameter of the class of concepts to be learned. Using this parameter, we analyze the complexity and closure properties of learnable classes. Authors A. Blumer and D. Haussler gratefully acknowledge the support of NSF grant IST-8317918, author A.

Positive results are shown for significant subclasses that allow not only propositional predicates but also some relations. The algorithms are extended so as to be provably tolerant to a certain quantifiable error rate in the examples data. It is further shown that under certain restrictions on these subclasses the learning algorithms are well suited to implementation on neural networks of threshold elements. The possible importance of disjunctions of conjunctions as a knowledge representation stems from the observations that on the one hand humans appear to like using it andon the other, that there is circumstantial evidence that significantly larger classes may not be learnable in polynomial time. An NP-completeness result corroborating the latter is also presented."

The methods in this paper lead to a unified treatment of some of Valiant's results, along with previous results on distribution-free convergence of certain pattern recognition algorithms. It is shown that the essential condition for distribution-free learnability is finiteness of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, a simple combinatorial parameter of the class of concepts to be learned. Using this parameter, the complexity and closure properties of learnable classes are analyzed, and the necessary and sufficient conditions are provided for feasible learnability."

Very rarely, a book is published which not only advances our knowledge of a particular topic, but fundamentally recasts our methods of investigating and thinking about large tracts of the map of learning. Linguists remember 1957 as the publication year of Noam Chomsky's Syntactic structures-a book whose ostensible subjects were the structure of English grammatical rules and the goals of grammatical description, but which can be seen with hindsight as the first shot in an intellectual revolution which ended by radically changing the texture of day-to-day research activity and discourse throughout almost all of linguistics, and in substantial parts of other cognition-related disciplines. In decades to come, perhaps 1986 will be remembered by academics as the year of publication of the pair of volumes reviewed here: they constitute the first large-scale public statement of an intellectual paradigm fully as revolutionary as the generative paradigm ever was (there have been scattered journal articles in the preceding four or five years). I would go further and suggest that, if the promises of this book can be redeemed, the contrast in linguistics and neighboring disciplines between the 1990's and the 1970's will be significantly greater than the contrast between the 1970's and the 1950's. (I need hardly add, of course, that it is one thing to fire an opening salvo, but another to achieve ultimate predominance.) The new paradigm is called Parallel Distributed Processing by the sixteen writers who contributed to this book, many of whom work either at the University of California, San Diego, or at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Some other researchers (e.g. Feldman 1985) use the term 'connectionism' for the same concept. These two volumes comprise 26 chapters which, among them, (i) explain the over-all nature and aims of PDP/connectionist models, (ii) define a family of specific variants of the general paradigm, and (iii) exemplify it by describing experiments in which PDP models were used to simulate human performance in various cognitive domains. The experiments, inevitably, treat their respective domains in a simplified, schematic way by comparison with the endless complexity found in any real-life cognitive area; but simplification in this case does not mean trivialization. There are also auxiliary chapters on relevant related topics; thus Chap. 9, by M. I. JORDAN, is a tutorial on linear algebra, a branch of mathematics having special significance for the PDP paradigm. (Each chapter is attributed to a particular author or"

This algorithm succeeds in e ciently learning r-of-k threshold functions by choosing hypotheses from a larger class of Boolean functions. Winnow1 and Winnow2 are natural algorithms for parallel implementation; Slade (1987) has implemented Winnow on the Connection Machine."

De nition 3 A set S X is shattered by a target class C if for every U S there exists a function f 2 C such that f is 1 on U and 0 on S U . De nition 4 TheVapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of a non-empty target class C is the cardinality of the largest set that is shattered by C. We will denote this V Cdim(C). We will de ne V Cdim(;) = 1. Theorem 4 For any target class C, V Cdim(C) opt(C). Proof: Let k = V Cdim(C). Choose any set fv1; : : : ; vkg X that is shattered by C. Then we can construct a complete k-mistake tree for C with all internal nodes at depth j labeled with vj+1 for j = 0; 1; : : : ; k 1. The nodes are chosen to be subclasses of C as required in the de nition of a mistake tree. These subclasses will be all non-empty (as required by the de nition) by virtue of the fact that fv1; : : : ; vkg is shattered by C. The Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension will prove to be a useful lower bound on opt(C) for concept classes that we will consider in later sections of the paper. However, there are also concept classes for which the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension is a very weak lower bound. In fact, as the following example shows, opt(C) can be arbitrarily large for classes for which V Cdim(C) = 1. Example 3 For n > 0, take X = f1; : : : ; 2n 1g. For each j 2 f1; : : : ; 2ng let fj : X ! f0; 1g be the function such that fj(x) = 1 if and only if x < j. Let C = ffj : 1 j 2ng. Then V Cdim(C) = 1 but opt(C) = n. To see this, rst note that for any f 2 C if f(x) = 1 then for all y < x, f(y) = 1. Thus no set of size 2 is shattered and V Cdim(C) = 1. Also, by Theorem 2, opt(C) log2 jCj = n. To see that opt(C) n we can construct a complete n-mistake tree. Label the root with the point 2n 1. We have 0(C; 2n 1) = ff1; : : : ; f2n 1g and 1(C; 2n 1) = ff2n 1+1; : : : ; f2ng. Each of these two subclasses is 2In Vapnik (1982), the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension is called the capacity."
