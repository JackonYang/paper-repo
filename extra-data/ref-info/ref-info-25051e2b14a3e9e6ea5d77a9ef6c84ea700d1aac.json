It will be seen that this is related in turn to methods for learning sprite based representations of an image. The method we describe involves a new generative model for performing segmentation on a set of images. Included in this model are the effects of motion blur and occlusion. An initial estimate of the parameters of the model is obtained by dividing the scene into rigidly moving components. The estimate of the matte of each part is refined using a variation of the \u03b1-expansion graph cut algorithm. This method has the advantage of achieving a strong local minimum over labels. Results are demonstrated on animals for which an articulated LPS representation is naturally suited."

Each part is represented using a simple appearance model and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. While pictorial structures were introduced a number of years ago, they have not been broadly applied to matching and recognition problems. This has been due in part to the computational difficulty of matching pictorial structures to images. In this paper we present an efficient algorithm for finding the best global match of a pictorial stucture to an image. With this improved algorithm, pictorial structures provide a practical and powerful framework for quantitative descriptions of objects and scenes, and are suitable for many generic image recognition problems. We illustrate the approach using simple models of a person and a car."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

Our method automatically identifies distinctive features in the training set. The set of model parameters is then learned using expectation maximization. When trained on different, unlabeled and unsegmented views of a class of objects, each component of the mixture model can adapt to represent a subset of the views. Similarly, different component models can also \"specialize\" on sub-classes of an object class. Experiments on images of human heads, leaves from different species of trees, and motor-cars demonstrate that the method works well over a wide variety of objects."

In this approach, a cascade of classifiers is arranged in a tree in order to recognize multiple object classes. We are interested in the problem of recognizing multiple patterns as it is closely related to the problem of locating an articulated object. Each different pattern class corresponds to the hand in a different pose, or set of poses. For this problem obtaining labelled training data of the hand in a given pose can be problematic. Given a parametric 3D model, generating training data in the form of example images is cheap, and we demonstate that it can be used to design classifiers almost as good as those trained using non-synthetic data. We compare a variety of different template-based classifiers and discuss their merits."

A vocabulary of information-rich object parts is automatically constructed from a set of sample images of the object class of interest. Images are then represented using parts from this vocabulary, along with spatial relations observed among them. Based on this representation, a feature-efficient learning algorithm is used to learn to detect instances of the object class. The framework developed can be applied to any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial configuration. We report experiments on images of side views of cars. Our experiments show that the method achieves high detection accuracy on a difficult test set of real-world images, and is highly robust to partial occlusion and background variation.In addition, we discuss and offer solutions to several methodological issues that are significant for the research community to be able to evaluate object detection approaches."

Humans are modeled as flexible assemblies of parts, and robust part detection is the key to the approach. The parts are represented by co-occurrences of local features which captures the spatial layout of the partrsquos appearance. Feature selection and the part detectors are learnt from training images using AdaBoost. The detection algorithm is very efficient as (i) all part detectors use the same initial features, (ii) a coarse-to-fine cascade approach is used for part detection, (iii) a part assembly strategy reduces the number of spurious detections and the search space. The results outperform existing human detectors."

The video sequence need not have any form of special background. Animals are modeled as a 2D kinematic chain of rectangular segments, where the number of segments and the topology of the chain are unknown. The system detects possible segments, clusters segments whose appearance is coherent over time, and then builds a spatial model of such segment clusters. The resulting representation of the spatial configuration of the animal in each frame can be seen either as a track - in which case the system described should be viewed as a generalized tracker, that is capable of modeling objects while tracking them - or as the source of an appearance model which can be used to build detectors for the particular animal. This is because knowing a video sequence is temporally coherent - i.e. that a particular animal is present through the sequence - is a strong supervisory signal. The method is shown to be successful as a tracker on video sequences of real scenes showing three different animals. For the same reason it is successful as a tracker, the method results in detectors that can be used to find each animal fairly reliably within the Corel collection of images."

Generally, a likelihood value is calculated from similarity measures, however the relation between these measures and the data likelihood is often incorrectly stated. It is clear that accurate likelihood estimation will improve the efficiency of the matching algorithms. This paper introduces a novel method for estimating the likelihood PDFS accurately based on the PDF Projection Theorem, which provides the correct relation between the feature likelihood and the data likelihood, permitting the use of different types of features for different types of objects and still estimating consistent likelihoods. The proposed method removes the normalization and bias problems that are usually associated with the likelihood calculations. We demonstrate that it significantly improves template matching in pose estimation problems. Qualitative and quantitative results are compared against traditional likelihood estimation schemes."

We show that the method leads to markedly improved segmentation results and can deal with significant variation in shape and varying backgrounds.

The process is reformulated in a linear vector space and the role of the different subspaces is emphasized. Within this framework wellknown artifacts of the gradient-based edge detectors, such as large spurious responses can be explained quantitatively. It is also shown that template matching with a template derived from the input data is meaningful since it provides an independent measure of confidence in the presence of the employed edge model. The widely used three-step edge detection procedure - gradient estimation, non-maxima suppression, hysteresis thresholding - is generalized to include the information provided by the confidence measure. The additional amount of computation is minimal and experiments with several standard test images show the ability of the new procedure to detect weak edges."

A new probability density function (PDF) projection theorem makes it possible to project probability density functions from a low-dimensional feature space back to the raw data space. An M-ary classifier is constructed by estimating the PDFs of class-specific features, then transforming each PDF back to the raw data space where they can be fairly compared. Although statistical sufficiency is not a requirement, the classifier thus constructed becomes equivalent to the optimal Bayes classifier if the features meet sufficiency requirements individually for each class. This classifier is completely modular and avoids the dimensionality curse associated with large complex problems. By recursive application of the projection theorem, it is possible to analyze complex signal processing chains. We apply the method to feature sets, including linear functions of independent random variables, cepstrum, and Mel cepstrum. In addition, we demonstrate how it is possible to automate the feature and model selection process by direct comparison of log-likelihood values on the common raw data domain."

The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty\u0097and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition\u0097in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability."
