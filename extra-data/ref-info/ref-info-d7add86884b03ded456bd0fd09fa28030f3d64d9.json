Providing this supervision is a major bottleneck in scaling semantic parsers. This paper presents a new learning paradigm aimed at alleviating the supervision burden. We develop two novel learning algorithms capable of predicting complex structures which only rely on a binary feedback signal based on the context of an external world. In addition we reformulate the semantic parsing problem to reduce the dependency of the model on syntactic patterns, thus allowing our parser to scale better using less supervision. Our results surprisingly show that without using any annotated meaning representations learning with a weak feedback signal is capable of producing a parser that is competitive with fully supervised parsers."

A semantic parser is learned given a set of sentences annotated with their correct meaning representations. The main innovation of WASP is its use of state-of-the-art statistical machine translation techniques. A word alignment model is used for lexical acquisition, and the parsing model itself can be seen as a syntax-based translation model. We show that WASP performs favorably in terms of both accuracy and coverage compared to existing learning methods requiring similar amount of supervision, and shows better robustness to variations in task complexity and word order."

The need for NLI's has become more pronounced due to the widespread access to complex databases now available through the Internet. A challenging problem for empirical NLP is the automated acquisition of NLI's from training examples. We present a method for integrating statistical and relational learning techniques for this task which exploits the strength of both approaches. Experimental results from three different domains suggest that such an approach is more robust than a previous purely logic-based approach."

But the efficacy of such parsers can be surprisingly low, particularly for sentences drawn from heterogeneous corpora such as the Web. We have observed that incorrect parses often result in wildly implausible semantic interpretations of sentences, which can be detected automatically using semantic information obtained from the Web. \n \nBased on this observation, we introduce Web-based semantic filtering---a novel, domain-independent method for automatically detecting and discarding incorrect parses. We measure the effectiveness of our filtering system, called Woodward, on two test collections. On a set of TREC questions, it reduces error by 67%. On a set of more complex Penn Treebank sentences, the reduction in error rate was 20%."

It first uses an integrated statistical parser to produce a semantically augmented parse tree, in which each non-terminal node has both a syntactic and a semantic label. A compositional-semantics procedure is then used to map the augmented parse tree into a final meaning representation. We evaluate the system in two domains, a natural-language database interface and an interpreter for coaching instructions in robotic soccer. We present experimental results demonstrating that Scissor produces more accurate semantic representations than several previous approaches."

We use hierarchical Pitman-Yor processes to model statistical dependencies between meaning representations of predicates and those of their arguments, as well as the clusters of their syntactic realizations. We develop a modification of the Metropolis-Hastings split-merge sampler, resulting in an efficient inference algorithm for the model.

The proposed method does not require any annotated data or aligned corpora. Instead, it is bootstrapped using a simple resource -- a romanization table. We show that this resource, when used in conjunction with constraints, can efficiently identify transliteration pairs. We evaluate the proposed method on transliterating English NEs to three different languages - Chinese, Russian and Hebrew. Our experiments show that constraint driven learning can significantly outperform existing unsupervised models and achieve competitive results to existing supervised models."

This is especially true for systems that do not use separate named-entity recognition components, instead relying on general-purpose shallow parsing. Such systems have greater applicability, because they are able to extract relations that contain attributes of unknown types. However, this generality comes with the cost in accuracy. In this paper we show how to use corpus statistics to validate and correct the arguments of extracted relation instances, improving the overall RE performance. We test the methods on SRES \u2013 a self-supervised Web relation extraction system. We also compare the performance of corpus-based methods to the performance of validation and correction methods based on supervised NER components."

The number of such sentences grows when the training and test data are taken from different domains, which is the case for major web applications such as information retrieval and question answering. In this paper we present a Sample Ensemble Parse Assessment (SEPA) algorithm for detecting parse quality. We use a function of the agreement among several copies of a parser, each of which trained on a different sample from the training data, to assess parse quality. We experimented with both generative and reranking parsers (Collins, Charniak and Johnson respectively). We show superior results over several baselines, both when the training and test data are from the same domain and when they are from different domains. For a test setting used by previous work, we show an error reduction of 31% as opposed to their 20%."

In this paper, we suggest a method for incorporating domain knowledge in semi-supervised learning algorithms. Our novel framework unies and can exploit several kinds of task specic constraints. The experimental results presented in the information extraction domain demonstrate that applying constraints helps the model to generate better feedback during learning, and hence the framework allows for high performance learning with significantly less training data than was possible before on these tasks."

However, its focus has been primarily on computing word-, concept-, or utterance-level confidences. Motivated by the need from sophisticated dialogue systems for more effective dialogs, we generalize the confidence annotation to all the subtrees, the first effort in this line of research. The other contribution of this work is that we incorporated novel long distance features to address challenges in computing multi-level confidence scores. Using Conditional Maximum Entropy (CME) classifier with all the selected features, we reached an annotation error rate of 26.0% in the SWBD corpus, compared with a subtree error rate of 41.91%, a closely related benchmark with the Charniak parser from (Kahn et al., 2005)."

In this paper we use selftraining in order to improve the quality of a parser and to adapt it to a different domain, using only small amounts of manually annotated seed data. We report significant improvement both when the seed and test data are in the same domain and in the outof-domain adaptation scenario. In particular, we achieve 50% reduction in annotation cost for the in-domain case, yielding an improvement of 66% over previous work, and a 20-33% reduction for the domain adaptation case. This is the first time that self-training with small labeled datasets is applied successfully to these tasks. We were also able to formulate a characterization of when selftraining is valuable."

A large number of rules is needed for coverage of the domain, suggesting that a fairly large number of labeled examples should be required to train a classifier. However, we show that the use of unlabeled data can reduce the requirements for supervision to just 7 simple \"seed\" rules. The approach gains leverage from natural redundancy in the data: for many named-entity instances both the spelling of the name and the context inwhich it appears are sufficient to determine its type. We present two algorithms. The first method uses a similar algorithm to that of (Yarowsky 95), with modifications motivated by (Blum and Mitchell 98). The second algorithm extends ideas from boosting algorithms, designed for supervised learning tasks, to the framework suggested by (Blum and Mitchell 98)."

CHILL treats parser acquisition as the learning of search-control rules within a logic program representing a shift-reduce parser and uses techniques from Inductive Logic Programming to learn relational control knowledge. Starting with a general framework for constructing a suitable logical form, CHILL is able to train on a corpus comprising sentences paired with database queries and induce parsers that map subsequent sentences directly into executable queries. Experimental results with a complete database-query application for U.S. geography show that CHILL is able to learn parsers that outperform a preexisting, hand-crafted counterpart. These results demonstrate the ability of a corpus-based system to produce more than purely syntactic representations. They also provide direct evidence of the utility of an empirical approach at the level of a complete natural language application."

In most cases there are complex relationships among these variables representing dependencies that range from simple statistical correlations to those that are constrained by deeper structural, relational and semantic properties of the text. In this work we study a specific instantiation of this problem in the context of identifying named entities and relations between them in free form text. Given a collection of discrete random variables representing outcomes of learned local predictors for entities and relations, we seek an optimal global assignment to the variables that respects multiple constraints, including constraints on the type of arguments a relation can take, and the mutual activity of different relations. We develop a linear programming formulation to address this global inference problem and evaluate it in the context of simultaneously learning named entities and relations. We show that global inference improves stand-alone learning; in addition, our approach allows us to efficiently incorporate expressive domain and task specific constraints at decision time, resulting, beyond significant improvements in the accuracy, in \u201ccoherent\u201d quality of the inference."

The quality of the tagging induced by such algorithms is thus highly variable, and researchers report average results over several random initializations. Consequently, applications are not guaranteed to use an induced tagging of the quality reported for the algorithm. \n \nIn this paper we address this issue using an unsupervised test for intrinsic clustering quality. We run a base tagger with different random initializations, and select the best tagging using the quality test. As a base tagger, we modify a leading unsupervised POS tagger (Clark, 2003) to constrain the distributions of word types across clusters to be Zipfian, allowing us to utilize a perplexity-based quality test. We show that the correlation between our quality test and gold standard-based tagging quality measures is high. Our results are better in most evaluation measures than all results reported in the literature for this task, and are always better than the Clark average results."

Despite the successes of these systems, accuracy will always be imperfect. For many reasons, it is highly desirable to accurately estimate the confidence the system has in the correctness of each extracted field. The information extraction system we evaluate is based on a linear-chain conditional random field (CRF), a probabilistic model which has performed well on information extraction tasks because of its ability to capture arbitrary, overlapping features of the input in a Markov model. We implement several techniques to estimate the confidence of both extracted fields and entire multi-field records, obtaining an average precision of 98% for retrieving correct fields and 87% for multi-field records."

The answering agents adopt fundamentally different strategies, one utilizing primarily knowledge-based mechanisms and the other adopting statistical techniques. We present our multi-level answer resolution algorithm that combines results from the answering agents at the question, passage, and/or answer levels. Experiments evaluating the effectiveness of our answer resolution algorithm show a 35.0% relative improvement over our baseline system in the number of questions correctly answered, and a 32.8% improvement according to the average precision metric."

In particular, we consider a problem setting motivated by the task of learning to classify web pages, in which the description of each example can be partitioned into two distinct views. For example, the description of a web page can be partitioned into the words occurring on that page, and the words occurring in hyperlinks t,hat point to that page. We assume that either view of the example would be sufficient for learning if we had enough labeled data, but our goal is to use both views together to allow inexpensive unlabeled data to augment, a much smaller set of labeled examples. Specifically, the presence of two distinct views of each example suggests strategies in which two learning algorithms are trained separately on each view, and then each algorithm\u2019s predictions on new unlabeled examples are used to enlarge the training set of the other. Our goal in this paper is to provide a PAC-style analysis for this setting, and, more broadly, a PAC-style framework for the general problem of learning from both labeled and unlabeled data. We also provide empirical results on real web-page data indicating that this use of unlabeled examples can lead to significant improvement of hypotheses in practice. *This research was supported in part by the DARPA HPKB program under contract F30602-97-1-0215 and by NSF National Young investigator grant CCR-9357793.

These measures provide a method for labeling each word in an automatically generated translation as correct or incorrect. All approaches to confidence estimation presented here are based on word posterior probabilities. Different concepts of word posterior probabilities as well as different ways of calculating them will be introduced and compared. They can be divided into two categories: System-based methods that explore knowledge provided by the translation system that generated the translations, and direct methods that are independent of the translation system. The system-based techniques make use of system output, such as word graphs or N-best lists. The word posterior probability is determined by summing the probabilities of the sentences in the translation hypothesis space that contains the target word. The direct confidence measures take other knowledge sources, such as word or phrase lexica, into account. They can be applied to output from nonstatistical machine translation systems as well. Experimental assessment of the different confidence measures on various translation tasks and in several language pairs will be presented. Moreover,the application of confidence measures for rescoring of translation hypotheses will be investigated."

We assume access to a reward function that defines the quality of the executed actions. During training, the learner repeatedly constructs action sequences for a set of documents, executes those actions, and observes the resulting reward. We use a policy gradient algorithm to estimate the parameters of a log-linear model for action selection. We apply our method to interpret instructions in two domains --- Windows troubleshooting guides and game tutorials. Our results demonstrate that this method can rival supervised learning techniques while requiring few or no annotated training examples."

A modified decoder based on the GCS is then proposed. The GCS is defined as a combination of various confidence scores obtained by exponential weighting from various confidence information sources, such as likelihood, likelihood ratio, duration, language model probabilities, etc. We also propose the use of a confidence preprocessor to transform raw scores into manageable terms for easy integration. We consider two kinds of hybrid decoders, an ordinary hybrid decoder and an extended hybrid decoder, as implementation examples based on the generalized confidence score. The ordinary hybrid decoder uses a frame-level likelihood ratio in addition to a frame-level likelihood, while a conventional decoder uses only the frame likelihood or likelihood ratio. The extended hybrid decoder uses not only the frame-level likelihood but also multilevel information such as frame-level, phone-level, and word-level confidence scores based on the likelihood ratios. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed hybrid decoders give better results than those obtained by the conventional decoders, especially in dealing with ill-formed utterances that contain out-of-vocabulary words and phrases."
