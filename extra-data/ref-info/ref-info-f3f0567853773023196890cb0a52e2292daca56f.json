These techniques allow to minimize efficiently certain energy functions corresponding to pairwise Markov random fields (MRFs). Currently, there is an accepted view within the computer vision community that graph cuts can only be used for optimizing a limited class of MRF energies (e.g., submodular functions). In this survey, we review some results that show that graph cuts can be applied to a much larger class of energy functions (in particular, nonsubmodular functions). While these results are well-known in the optimization community, to our knowledge they were not used in the context of computer vision and MRF optimization. We demonstrate the relevance of these results to vision on the problem of binary texture restoration."

                "text": "One of the most exciting advances in early vision has been the development of efficient energy minimization algorithms. Many early vision tasks require labeling each pixel with some quantity such as depth or texture. While many such problems can be elegantly expressed in the language of Markov Random Fields (MRF's), the resulting energy minimization problems were widely viewed as intractable. Recently, algorithms such as graph cuts and loopy belief propagation (LBP) have proven to be very powerful: for example, such methods form the basis for almost all the top-performing stereo methods. Unfortunately, most papers define their own energy function, which is minimized with a specific algorithm of their choice. As a result, the tradeoffs among different energy minimization algorithms are not well understood. In this paper we describe a set of energy minimization benchmarks, which we use to compare the solution quality and running time of several common energy minimization algorithms. We investigate three promising recent methods\u2014graph cuts, LBP, and tree-reweighted message passing\u2014as well as the well-known older iterated conditional modes (ICM) algorithm. Our benchmark problems are drawn from published energy functions used for stereo, image stitching and interactive segmentation. We also provide a general-purpose software interface that allows vision researchers to easily switch between optimization methods with minimal overhead. We expect that the availability of our benchmarks and interface will make it significantly easier for vision researchers to adopt the best method for their specific problems. Benchmarks, code, results and images are available at http://vision.middlebury.edu/MRF."

We call this approach VISTA\u2014Vision by Image/Scene TrAining.We apply VISTA to the \u201csuper-resolution\u201d problem (estimating high frequency details from a low-resolution image), showing good results. To illustrate the potential breadth of the technique, we also apply it in two other problem domains, both simplified. We learn to distinguish shading from reflectance variations in a single image under particular lighting conditions. For the motion estimation problem in a \u201cblobs world\u201d, we show figure/ground discrimination, solution of the aperture problem, and filling-in arising from application of the same probabilistic machinery."

(Nov. 2005)- tree-reweighted max-product message passing (TRW). It was inspired by the problem of maximizing a lower bound on the energy. However, the algorithm is not guaranteed to increase this bound - it may actually go down. In addition, TRW does not always converge. We develop a modification of this algorithm which we call sequential tree-reweighted message passing. Its main property is that the bound is guaranteed not to decrease. We also give a weak tree agreement condition which characterizes local maxima of the bound with respect to TRW algorithms. We prove that our algorithm has a limit point that achieves weak tree agreement. Finally, we show that, our algorithm requires half as much memory as traditional message passing approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that on certain synthetic and real problems, our algorithm outperforms both the ordinary belief propagation and tree-reweighted algorithm in (M. J. Wainwright, et al., Nov. 2005). In addition, on stereo problems with Potts interactions, we obtain a lower energy than graph cuts"

The combinatorial optimization literature provides many min-cut/max-flow algorithms with different polynomial time complexity. Their practical efficiency, however, has to date been studied mainly outside the scope of computer vision. The goal of this paper is to provide an experimental comparison of the efficiency of min-cut/max flow algorithms for applications in vision. We compare the running times of several standard algorithms, as well as a new algorithm that we have recently developed. The algorithms we study include both Goldberg-Tarjan style \"push -relabel\" methods and algorithms based on Ford-Fulkerson style \"augmenting paths.\" We benchmark these algorithms on a number of typical graphs in the contexts of image restoration, stereo, and segmentation. In many cases, our new algorithm works several times faster than any of the other methods, making near real-time performance possible. An implementation of our max-flow/min-cut algorithm is available upon request for research purposes."

While the Bayesian approach has been successfully applied in the Markov random field literature, the resulting combinatorial optimization problems have been commonly treated with rather inefficient and inexact general purpose optimization methods such as Simulated Annealing. An efficient method to compute the global optima of certain classes of cost functions defined on binary-valued variables is given by graph min-cuts. In this paper, we propose to reconsider the problem of statistical learning for Bayesian inference in the context of efficient optimization schemes. Specifically, we address the question: Which prior information may be learned while retaining the ability to apply Graph Cut optimization? We provide a framework to learn and impose prior knowledge on the distribution of pairs and triplets of labels. As an illustration, we demonstrate that one can optimally restore binary textures from very noisy images with runtimes on the order of a second while imposing hundreds of statistically learned constraints per pixel."

The major restriction is that the energy function's smoothness term must only involve pairs of pixels. We propose two algorithms that use graph cuts to compute a local minimum even when very large moves are allowed. The first move we consider is an /spl alpha/-/spl beta/-swap: for a pair of labels /spl alpha/,/spl beta/, this move exchanges the labels between an arbitrary set of pixels labeled a and another arbitrary set labeled /spl beta/. Our first algorithm generates a labeling such that there is no swap move that decreases the energy. The second move we consider is an /spl alpha/-expansion: for a label a, this move assigns an arbitrary set of pixels the label /spl alpha/. Our second algorithm, which requires the smoothness term to be a metric, generates a labeling such that there is no expansion move that decreases the energy. Moreover, this solution is within a known factor of the global minimum. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration, stereo and motion."

We describe an application of MRF\u0092s to a non-traditional but important problem in medical imaging: the reconstruction of MR images from raw fourier data. This can be formulated as a linear inverse problem, where the goal is to find a spatially smooth solution while permitting discontinuities. Although it is easy to apply MRF\u0092s to the MR reconstruction problem, the resulting energy minimization problem poses some interesting challenges. It lies outside of the class of energy functions that can be straightforwardlyminimized with graph cuts. We show how graph cuts can nonetheless be adapted to solve this problem, and provide some theoretical analysis of the properties of our algorithm. Experimentally, our method gives very strong performance, with a substantial improvement in SNR when compared with widely-used methods for MR reconstruction."

We show how this algorithm can be used to efficiently compute MAP estimates for dynamically changing MRF models of labeling problems in computer vision, such as image segmentation. Specifically, given the solution of the max-flow problem on a graph, we show how to efficiently compute the maximum flow in a modified version of the graph. Our experiments showed that the time taken by our algorithm is roughly proportional to the number of edges whose weights were different in the two graphs. We test the performance of our algorithm on one particular problem: the object-background segmentation problem for video and compare it with the best known st-mincut algorithm. The results show that the dynamic graph cut algorithm is much faster than its static counterpart and enables real time image segmentation. It should be noted that our method is generic and can be used to yield similar improvements in many other cases that involve dynamic change in the graph"

In this paper, we consider the generalized problem where the system matrix H is an arbitrary nonnegative matrix. Linear inverse problems can be solved by adding a regularization term to impose spatial smoothness. To avoid oversmoothing, the regularization term must preserve discontinuities; this results in a particularly challenging energy minimization problem. Where H is diagonal, as occurs in image denoising, the energy function can be solved by techniques such as graph cuts, which have proven to be very effective for problems in early vision. When H is nondiagonal, however, the data cost for a pixel to have a intensity depends on the hypothesized intensities of nearby pixels, so existing graph cut methods cannot be applied. This paper shows how to use graph cuts to obtain a discontinuity preserving solution to a linear inverse system with an arbitrary non-negative system matrix. We use a dynamically chosen approximation to the energy which can he minimized by graph cuts; minimizing this approximation also decreases the original energy. Experimental results are shown for MRI reconstruction from Fourier data"

In contrast to existing techniques, which explicitly reconstruct the 3D geometry of the scene, we transform the problem to the reconstruction of colour rather than depth. This retains the benefits of geometric constraints, but projects out the ambiguities in depth estimation which occur in textureless regions.On the other hand, regularization is still needed in order to generate high-quality images. The paper\u2019s second contribution is to constrain the generated views to lie in the space of images whose texture statistics are those of the input images. This amounts to an image-based prior on the reconstruction which regularizes the solution, yielding realistic synthetic views. Examples are given of new view generation for cameras interpolated between the acquisition viewpoints\u2014which enables synthetic steadicam stabilization of a sequence with a high level of realism."

                "text": "This paper addresses the novel problem of automatically synthesizing an output image from a large collection of different input images. The synthesized image, called a digital tapestry, can be viewed as a visual summary or a virtual 'thumbnail' of all the images in the input collection. The problem of creating the tapestry is cast as a multi-class labeling problem such that each region in the tapestry is constructed from input image blocks that are salient and such that neighboring blocks satisfy spatial compatibility. This is formulated using a Markov random field and optimized via the graph cut based expansion move algorithm. The standard expansion move algorithm can only handle energies with metric terms, while our energy contains non-metric (soft and hard) constraints. Therefore we propose two novel contributions. First, we extend the expansion move algorithm for energy functions with non-metric hard constraints. Secondly, we modify it for functions with \"almost\" metric soft terms, and show that it gives good results in practice. The proposed framework was tested on several consumer photograph collections, and the results are presented."

Fully automated segmentation is an unsolved problem, while manual tracing is inaccurate and laboriously unacceptable. However, Intelligent Scissors allow objects within digital images to be extracted quickly and accurately using simple gesture motions with a mouse. When the gestured mouse position comes in proximity to an object edge, a live-wire boundary \u201csnaps\u201d to, and wraps around the object of interest. Live-wire boundary detection formulates discrete dynamic programming (DP) as a two-dimensional graph searching problem. DP provides mathematically optimal boundaries while greatly reducing sensitivity to local noise or other intervening structures. Robustness is further enhanced with on-the-fly training which causes the boundary to adhere to the specific type of edge currently being followed, rather than simply the strongest edge in the neighborhood. Boundary cooling automatically freezes unchanging segments and automates input of additional seed points. Cooling also allows the user to be much more free with the gesture path, thereby increasing the efficiency and finesse with which boundaries can be extracted. Extracted objects can be scaled, rotated, and composited using live-wire masks and spatial frequency equivalencing. Frequency equivalencing is performed by applying a Butterworth filter which matches the lowest frequency spectra to all other image components. Intelligent Scissors allow creation of convincing compositions from existing images while dramatically increasing the speed and precision with which objects can be extracted."

                "text": "We propose several efficient preprocessing techniques for Unconstrained Quadratic Binary Optimization (QUBO), including the direct use of enhanced versions of known basic techniques (e.g., implications derived from first and second order derivatives and from roof\u2013duality), and the integrated use (e.g., by probing and by consensus) of the basic techniques. The application of these techniques is implemented using a natural network flow model of QUBO. The use of the proposed preprocessing techniques provides: (i) a lower bound of the minimum of the objective function, (ii) the values of some of the variables in some or every optimum, (iii) binary relations (equations, inequalities, or non-equalities) between the values of certain pairs of variables in some or every optimum, and (iv) the decomposition (if possible) of the original problem into several smaller pairwise independent QUBO problems. Extensive computational experience showing the efficiency of the proposed techniques is presented. Substantial problem simplifications, improving considerably the existing techniques, are demonstrated on benchmark problems as well as on randomly generated ones. In particular, it is shown that 100% data reduction is achieved using the proposed preprocessing techniques for MAX-CUT graphs derived from VLSI design, MAX-Clique in c-fat graphs derived from fault diagnosis, and minimum vertex cover problems in random planar graphs of up to 500 000 vertices.

The user marks certain pixels as \"object\" or \"background\" to provide hard constraints for segmentation. Additional soft constraints incorporate both boundary and region information. Graph cuts are used to find the globally optimal segmentation of the N-dimensional image. The obtained solution gives the best balance of boundary and region properties among all segmentations satisfying the constraints. The topology of our segmentation is unrestricted and both \"object\" and \"background\" segments may consist of several isolated parts. Some experimental results are presented in the context of photo/video editing and medical image segmentation. We also demonstrate an interesting Gestalt example. A fast implementation of our segmentation method is possible via a new max-flow algorithm."

Four equivalent problems are discussed\u2014the primal, the \u2018complementation\u2019, the \u2018discrete Rhys LP\u2019 and the \u2018weighted stability problem of a SAM graph\u2019. Each of them has a relaxation\u2014the \u2018roof dual\u2019, the \u2018quadratic complementation,\u2019 the \u2018continuous Rhys LP\u2019 and the \u2018fractional weighted stability problem of a SAM graph\u2019. The main result is that the four gaps associated with the four relaxations are equal. Furthermore, a solution to any of these problems leads at once to solutions of the other three equivalent ones. The four relaxations can be solved in polynomial time by transforming them to a bipartite maximum flow problem. The optimal solutions of the \u2018roof-dual\u2019 define \u2018best\u2019 linear majorantsp(x) off, having the following persistency property: if theith coefficient inp is positive (negative) thenxi=1 (0) in every optimum of the primal problem. Several characterizations are given for the case where these persistency results cannot be used to fix any variable of the primal. On the other hand, a class of gap-free functions (properly including the supermodular ones) is exhibited."

For a TRW fixed point satisfying the strong tree agreement condition, the algorithm outputs a configuration that is provably optimal. In this paper, we focus on the case of binary variables with pairwise couplings, and establish stronger properties of TRW fixed points that satisfy only the milder condition of weak tree agreement (WTA). First, we demonstrate how it is possible to identify part of the optimal solution\u2014i.e., a provably optimal solution for a subset of nodes\u2014 without knowing a complete solution. Second, we show that for submodular functions, a WTA fixed point always yields a globally optimal solution. We establish that for binary variables, any WTA fixed point always achieves the global maximum of the linear programming relaxation underlying the TRW method."

This is the problem of maximising a quadratic objective by suitable choice of binary (zero-one) variables. We present two heuristic algorithms based upon tabu search and simulated annealing for this problem. Computational results are presented for a number of publically available data sets involving up to 2500 variables. An interesting feature of our results is that whilst for most problems tabu search dominates simulated annealing for the very largest problems we consider the converse is true. This paper typifies a \"multiple solution technique, single paper\" approach, i.e. an approach that within the same paper presents results for a number of different heuristics applied to the same problem. Issues relating to algorithmic design for such papers are discussed."
