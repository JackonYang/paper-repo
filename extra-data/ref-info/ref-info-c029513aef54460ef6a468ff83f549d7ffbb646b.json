A system with such abilities would be a powerful tool for studying embryo genesis and gene function based on mutants, whose cell lineage may differ from that of wild types. We have designed and implemented a system for this purpose, and examined its ability through computational experiments. The procedure of our system consists of two parts: (1) Image processing which detect the positions of the nuclei from each 2D microscope image, and (2) Constructing a hypothetical cell lineage based on the information obtained in (1). We have also developed a tool which allows a human expert to easily filter out erroneous nuclei candidates generated in (1). We present computational results and also discuss other ideas which may improve the performance of our system."

The entire procedure of quantitative microscopy is comprised of specimen preparation, light absorption/reflection/emission from the specimen, microscope optical processing, optical/electrical conversion by a camera or detector, and computational processing of digitized images. Although many of the latest digital signal processing techniques have been successfully applied to compress, restore, and register digital microscope images, automated approaches for recognition and understanding of complex subcellular patterns in light microscope images have been far less widely used. We describe a systematic approach for interpreting protein subcellular distributions using various sets of subcellular location features (SLF), in combination with supervised classification and unsupervised clustering methods. These methods can handle complex patterns in digital microscope images, and the features can be applied for other purposes such as objectively choosing a representative image from a collection and performing statistical comparisons of image sets."

Cell arrays and microwell transfection assays on cultured cells have made cell phenotype analysis accessible to high-throughput experiments. Both the localization of each protein in the proteome and the effect of RNAi knock-down of individual genes on cell morphology can be assayed by manual inspection of microscopic images. However, the use of morphological readouts for functional genomics requires fast and automatic identification of complex cellular phenotypes. Here, we present a fully automated platform for high-throughput cell phenotype screening combining human live cell arrays, screening microscopy, and machine-learning-based classification methods. Efficiency of this platform is demonstrated by classification of eleven subcellular patterns marked by GFP-tagged proteins. Our classification method can be adapted to virtually any microscopic assay based on cell morphology, opening a wide range of applications including large-scale RNAi screening in human cells."

Images representing the localization patterns of 4 proteins and DNA were obtained using fluorescence microscopy and divided into distinct training and test sets. The images were processed to remove out-of-focus and background fluorescence and 2 sets of numeric features were generated: Zernike moments and Haralick texture features. These feature sets were used as inputs to either a classification tree or a neural network. Classifier performance (the average percent of each type of image correctly classified) on previously unseen images ranged from 63% for a classification tree using Zernike moments to 88% for a backpropagation neural network using a combination of features from the 2 feature sets. These results demonstrate the feasibility of applying pattern recognition methods to subcellular localization patterns, enabling sets of previously unseen images from a single class to be classified with an expected accuracy greater than 99%. This will provide not only a new automated way to describe proteins, based on localization rather than sequence, but also has potential application in the automation of microscope functions and in the field of gene discovery."

To identify genes involved in these events, we collected four\u2010dimensional time\u2010lapse video recordings of the first three cell divisions and analysed terminal phenotypes after RNA interference of 147 embryonic lethal genes previously identified in a systematic screen of Caenorhabditis elegans chromosome I. Over half gave defects in early processes such as meiosis, the assembly or position of the first mitotic spindle, cytokinesis, and proper nuclear positioning. For some phenotypic classes, the majority of genes are involved in a shared biochemical process. In addition, we identified loss\u2010of\u2010function phenotypes for genes of unknown function, but for which homologues exist in other organisms, shedding light on the function of these uncharacterized genes. When applied to the whole genome, this approach should identify the vast majority of genes required for early cell processes, paving the way for a greatly improved understanding of these processes and their regulation at the molecular level."

This creates a need for comprehensive studies to fill the gap between sequence and function. Here we report the results of a functional genomic screen to identify genes required for cell division in Caenorhabditis elegans. We inhibited the expression of \u223c96% of the \u223c2,300 predicted open reading frames on chromosome III using RNA-mediated interference (RNAi). By using an in vivo time-lapse differential interference contrast microscopy assay, we identified 133 genes (\u223c6%) necessary for distinct cellular processes in early embryos. Our results indicate that these genes represent most of the genes on chromosome III that are required for proper cell division in C. elegans embryos. The complete data set, including sample time-lapse recordings, has been deposited in an open access database. We found that \u223c47% of the genes associated with a differential interference contrast phenotype have clear orthologues in other eukaryotes, indicating that this screen provides putative gene functions for other species as well."

We formulate features that respond to characteristic changes in brightness, color, and texture associated with natural boundaries. In order to combine the information from these features in an optimal way, we train a classifier using human labeled images as ground truth. The output of this classifier provides the posterior probability of a boundary at each image location and orientation. We present precision-recall curves showing that the resulting detector significantly outperforms existing approaches. Our two main results are 1) that cue combination can be performed adequately with a simple linear model and 2) that a proper, explicit treatment of texture is required to detect boundaries in natural images."

The proposed system automatically synthesizes simple problem-specific feature extractors from a training set of face and nonface patterns, without making any assumptions or using any hand-made design concerning the features to extract or the areas of the face pattern to analyze. The face detection procedure acts like a pipeline of simple convolution and subsampling modules that treat the raw input image as a whole. We therefore show that an efficient face detection system does not require any costly local preprocessing before classification of image areas. The proposed scheme provides very high detection rate with a particularly low level of false positives, demonstrated on difficult test sets, without requiring the use of multiple networks for handling difficult cases. We present extensive experimental results illustrating the efficiency of the proposed approach on difficult test sets and including an in-depth sensitivity analysis with respect to the degrees of variability of the face patterns."

This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \"integral image\" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a \"cascade\" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection."

The system combines local image sampling, a self-organizing map (SOM) neural network, and a convolutional neural network. The SOM provides a quantization of the image samples into a topological space where inputs that are nearby in the original space are also nearby in the output space, thereby providing dimensionality reduction and invariance to minor changes in the image sample, and the convolutional neural network provides partial invariance to translation, rotation, scale, and deformation. The convolutional network extracts successively larger features in a hierarchical set of layers. We present results using the Karhunen-Loeve transform in place of the SOM, and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) in place of the convolutional network for comparison. We use a database of 400 images of 40 individuals which contains quite a high degree of variability in expression, pose, and facial details.

These hypotheses are then verified using a second neural network. The algorithm applies to images where the size of the faces is unknown a priori. The computational time which is necessary for the complete processing of an image is reasonable. With a classical workstation an image of size 512*512 is treated in 50 seconds including smoothing and normalization of the image. This algorithm can be easily installed on a more specialized machine as the major part of the operation is based on convolutions with kernels of size 5*5 or 8*8. In this paper, the authors assume that the face are well oriented in the image. It is possible to eliminate this assumption by following an approach similar to the one used for the scale problem. A net is trained to be insensitive to the precise orientation of the face. This kind of segmentation algorithm can be applied to other problems where the objects to be detected cannot be characterized easily by its outline or by classical primitives in image processing."

The splines are adjusted using a novel elastic matching procedure based on the expectation maximization algorithm that maximizes the likelihood of the model generating the data. This approach has many advantages: 1) the system not only produces a classification of the digit but also a rich description of the instantiation parameters which can yield information such as the writing style; 2) the generative models can perform recognition driven segmentation; 3) the method involves a relatively small number of parameters and hence training is relatively easy and fast; and 4) unlike many other recognition schemes, it does not rely on some form of pre-normalization of input images, but can handle arbitrary scalings, translations and a limited degree of image rotation. We have demonstrated that our method of fitting models to images does not get trapped in poor local minima. The main disadvantage of the method is that it requires much more computation than more standard OCR techniques."

A large dataset comprising stereo image pairs of 50 uniform-colored toys under 36 azimuths, 9 elevations, and 6 lighting conditions was collected (for a total of 194,400 individual images). The objects were 10 instances of 5 generic categories: four-legged animals, human figures, airplanes, trucks, and cars. Five instances of each category were used for training, and the other five for testing. Low-resolution grayscale images of the objects with various amounts of variability and surrounding clutter were used for training and testing. Nearest neighbor methods, support vector machines, and convolutional networks, operating on raw pixels or on PCA-derived features were tested. Test error rates for unseen object instances placed on uniform backgrounds were around 13% for SVM and 7% for convolutional nets. On a segmentation/recognition task with highly cluttered images, SVM proved impractical, while convolutional nets yielded 16/7% error. A real-time version of the system was implemented that can detect and classify objects in natural scenes at around 10 frames per second."

The proposed model exploits local discriminative models and allows to relax the assumption of conditional independence of the observed data given the labels, commonly used in the Markov Random Field (MRF) framework. The parameters of the DRF model are learned using penalized maximum pseudo-likelihood method. Furthermore, the form of the DRF model allows the MAP inference for binary classification problems using the graph min-cut algorithms. The performance of the model was verified on the synthetic as well as the real-world images. The DRF model outperforms the MRF model in the experiments."

Furthermore it is quite fast; it typically takes only a few seconds to compute a motion, and we expect that a more careful implementation can improve this even further. Finally, the resulting motions are relatively short and smooth, thus eliminating the need for additional (time-consuming) path smoothing. The generalization of the method to higher dimensions should be straightforward. However, it could still be improved in a number of details, such as a more powerful algorithm for nding a partial motion between two nodes. Also a complexity analysis would be interesting.

Let it grow | self-organizing feature maps with problem dependent cell structure. be explained by considering the size of the rotating robot in terms of the size of the connguration space. A full rotation of an average size robot occupies only a small part of the connguration space when compared to e.g., moving it from x = 0 to x = 1. Therefore an initial grid size of 4 in the dimension already allows for a better precision in that dimension than a grid of size 10 in the x and y dimension. To test the learning behavior of the network, 100 source and goal conngurations were randomly chosen. The success rate for a scene is deened as the relative number of these conngurations between which the program is able to construct a path. Note that this can only be equal to 1:0 if the connguration space consists of only one connected component. Figure 14 shows the success rate for Scenes 1, 4, and 5, set against the number of learning steps. The results for Scene 1 are indicated with a dotted line. The networks performance very quickly converges towards a success rate of 1.0, indicating it perfectly`knows' the whole scene. In the case of Scene 5 (shown with a dashed line), the network converges quickly, but towards a success rate of only 0.95. This can be explained by the fact that the scene contains conngurations from which the robot cannot escape (e.g., the small part of free space in the upper right corner). The same applies to Scene 4 (shown with a solid line) where the performance converges towards \u2026"

The method is demonstrated on DIC images of transparent latex spheres and unstained bovine spermatozoa. The images were obtained with a wide\u2010field DIC microscope, using monochromatic light. After image acquisition, the measured intensities were converted to pathlength differences. Filtering in the Fourier domain was applied to correct for the typical shadow\u2010cast effect of DIC images. The filter was constructed using the lateral shift introduced in the microscope, and parameters describing the spectral distribution of the signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratio. By varying these parameters and looking at the resulting images, an appropriate setting for the filter parameters was found. In the reconstructed image each grey value represents the optical pathlength at that particular location, enabling quantitative analysis of object parameters using standard image processing techniques. The advantage of using interferometric techniques is that measurements can be done on transparent objects, without staining, enabling observations on living cells. Quantitative use of images obtained by a wide\u2010field DIC microscope becomes possible with this technique, using relatively simple means."

It enables us to develop optimal vision algorithms systematically when used with optimization principles. This book presents a comprehensive study on the use of MRFs for solving computer vision problems. The book covers the following parts essential to the subject: introduction to fundamental theories, formulations of MRF vision models, MRF parameter estimation, and optimization algorithms. Various vision models are presented in a unified framework, including image restoration and reconstruction, edge and region segmentation, texture, stereo and motion, object matching and recognition, and pose estimation. This book is an excellent reference for researchers working in computer vision, image processing, statistical pattern recognition, and applications of MRFs. It is also suitable as a text for advanced courses in these areas."

A Bayesian scheme, which is based on this prior knowledge and the edge information in the input image, is employed to find a match between the deformed template and objects in the image. Computational efficiency is achieved via a coarse-to-fine implementation of the matching algorithm. Our method has been applied to retrieve objects with a variety of shapes from images with complex background.

The method employs a convolutional network to map face images to points on a manifold, parametrized by pose, and non-face images to points far from that manifold. This network is trained by optimizing a loss function of three variables: image, pose, and face/non-face label. We test the resulting system, in a single configuration, on three standard data sets - one for frontal pose, one for rotated faces, and one for profiles - and find that its performance on each set is comparable to previous multi-view face detectors that can only handle one form of pose variation. We also show experimentally that the system's accuracy on both face detection and pose estimation is improved by training for the two tasks together."

In the first step, a rough localisation is performed by presenting each pixel with its neighbourhood to a neural net which is able to indicate whether this pixel and its neighbourhood are the image of the search object. This first filter does not discriminate for position. From its result, areas which might contain an image of the object can be selected. In the second step, these areas are presented to another neural net which can determine the exact position of the object in each area. This algorithm is applied to the problem of localising faces in images."

Problems associated with initialization and poor convergence to concave boundaries, however, have limited their utility. This paper develops a new external force for active contours, largely solving both problems. This external force, which we call gradient vector flow (GVF) is computed as a diffusion of the gradient vectors of a gray-level or binary edge map derived from the image. The resultant field has a large capture range and forces active contours into concave regions. Examples on simulated images and one real image are presented."

The method can be used for recognition or verification applications where the number of categories is very large and not known during training, and where the number of training samples for a single category is very small. The idea is to learn a function that maps input patterns into a target space such that the L/sub 1/ norm in the target space approximates the \"semantic\" distance in the input space. The method is applied to a face verification task. The learning process minimizes a discriminative loss function that drives the similarity metric to be small for pairs of faces from the same person, and large for pairs from different persons. The mapping from raw to the target space is a convolutional network whose architecture is designed for robustness to geometric distortions. The system is tested on the Purdue/AR face database which has a very high degree of variability in the pose, lighting, expression, position, and artificial occlusions such as dark glasses and obscuring scarves."

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

They are iterative procedures that aim at reducing local ambiguities and achieving global consistency through a parallel exploitation of contextual information, which is quantitatively expressed in terms of a set of \"compatibility coefficients.\" The problem of determining compatibility coefficients has received a considerable attention in the past and many heuristic, statistical-based methods have been suggested. In this paper, the authors propose a rather different viewpoint to solve this problem: they derive them attempting to optimize the performance of the relaxation algorithm over a sample of training data; no statistical interpretation is given: compatibility coefficients are simply interpreted as real numbers, for which performance is optimal. Experimental results over a novel application of relaxation are given, which prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach. >"

Conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."

Such effects have been proposed to result from a simple antisense mechanism that depends on hybridization between the injected RNA and endogenous messenger RNA transcripts. RNA interference has been used in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to manipulate gene expression,. Here we investigate the requirements for structure and delivery of the interfering RNA. To our surprise, we found that double-stranded RNA was substantially more effective at producing interference than was either strand individually. After injection into adult animals, purified single strands had at most a modest effect, whereas double-stranded mixtures caused potent and specific interference. The effects of this interference were evident in both the injected animals and their progeny. Only a few molecules of injected double-stranded RNA were required per affected cell, arguing against stochiometric interference with endogenous mRNA and suggesting that there could be a catalytic or amplification component in the interference process."

Energy-based models (EBM) associate an energy to those configurations, eliminating the need for proper normalization of probability distributions. Making a decision (an inference) with an EBM consists in comparing the energies associated with various configurations of the variable to be predicted, and choosing the one with the smallest energy. Such systems must be trained discriminatively to associate low energies to the desired configurations and higher energies to undesired configurations. A wide variety of loss function can be used for this purpose. We give sufficient conditions that a loss function should satisfy so that its minimization will cause the system to approach to desired behavior. We give many specific examples of suitable loss functions, and show an application to object recognition in images."

In contrast to the causal generative extensions of ICA which maintain marginal independence of sources, we define features as deterministic (linear) functions of the inputs. This assumption results in marginal dependencies among the features, but conditional independence of the features given the inputs. By assigning energies to the features a probability distribution over the input states is defined through the Boltzmann distribution. Free parameters of this model are trained using the contrastive divergence objective (Hinton, 2002). When the number of features is equal to the number of input dimensions this energy-based model reduces to noiseless ICA and we show experimentally that the proposed learning algorithm is able to perform blind source separation on speech data. In additional experiments we train overcomplete energy-based models to extract features from various standard data-sets containing speech, natural images, hand-written digits and faces."

For each known digit, the control points have preferred \"home\" locations, and deformations of the digit are generated by moving the control points away from their home locations. Images of digits can be produced by placing Gaussian ink generators uniformly along the spline. Real images can be recognized by finding the digit model most likely to have generated the data. For each digit model we use an elastic matching algorithm to minimize an energy function that includes both the deformation energy of the digit model and the log probability that the model would generate the inked pixels in the image. The model with the lowest total energy wins. If a uniform noise process is included in the model of image generation, some of the inked pixels can be rejected as noise as a digit model is fitting a poorly segmented image. The digit models learn by modifying the home locations of the control points."

Most neural network approaches to this problem are for the situation in which only local knowledge about the configuration space is available. The main goal of the paper is to show that neural networks are also suitable tools in situations with complete knowledge of the configuration space. In this paper we present an approach that combines a neural network and deterministic techniques. We define a colored version of Kohonen's self-organizing map that consists of two different classes of nodes. The network is presented with random configurations of the robot and, from this information, it constructs a road map of possible motions in the work space. The map is a growing network, and different nodes are used to approximate boundaries of obstacles and the Voronoi diagram of the obstacles, respectively. In a second phase, the positions of the two kinds of nodes are combined to obtain the road map. In this way a number of typical problems with small obstacles and passages are avoided, and the required number of nodes for a given accuracy is within reasonable limits. This road map is searched to find a motion connecting the given source and goal configurations of the robot. The algorithm is simple and general; the only specific computation that is required is a check for intersection of two polygons. We implemented the algorithm for planar robots allowing both translation and rotation and experiments show that compared to conventional techniques it performs well, even for difficult motion planning scenes."

Frequently, processes are needed which reduce ambiguity and noise, and select the best label among several possible choices. Relaxation labeling processes are just such a class of algorithms. They are based on the parallel use of local constraints between labels. This paper develops a theory to characterize the goal of relaxation labeling. The theory is founded on a definition of con-sistency in labelings, extending the notion of constraint satisfaction. In certain restricted circumstances, an explicit functional exists that can be maximized to guide the search for consistent labelings. This functional is used to derive a new relaxation labeling operator. When the restrictions are not satisfied, the theory relies on variational cal-culus. It is shown that the problem of finding consistent labelings is equivalent to solving a variational inequality. A procedure nearly identical to the relaxation operator derived under restricted circum-stances serves in the more general setting. Further, a local convergence result is established for this operator. The standard relaxation labeling formulas are shown to approximate our new operator, which leads us to conjecture that successful applications of the standard methods are explainable by the theory developed here. Observations about con-vergence and generalizations to higher order compatibility relations are described."

A geometrical model of the word spatial structure is fitted to the pen trajectory using the expectation-maximisation algorithm. The fitting process maximizes the likelihood of the trajectory given the model and a set a priors on its parameters. The method was evaluated and integrated to a recognition system that combines neural networks and hidden Markov models."
