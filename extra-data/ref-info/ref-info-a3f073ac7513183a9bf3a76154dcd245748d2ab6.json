                "text": "Vector quantization, in its simplest form, may be regarded as a generalization of PCM (independent quantization of each sample of a waveform) to what might be called \"vector PCM,\" where a block of consecutive samples, a vector, is simultaneously quantized as one unit. In theory, a performance arbitrarily close to the ultimate rate-distortion limit is achievable with waveform vector quantization if the dimension of the vector, k , is large enough. The main obstacle in effectively using vector quantization is complexity. A vector quantizer of dimension k operating at a rate of r bits/sample requires a number of computations on the order of k2^{kr} and a memory of the same order. However, a low-dimensional vector quantizer (dimensions 4-8) achieves a remarkable improvement over scalar quantization (PCM). Consequently, using the vector quantizer as a building block and imbedding it with other waveform data compression techniques may lead to the development of a new and powerful class of waveform coding systems. This paper proposes and analyzes a waveform coding system, adaptive vector predictive coding (AVPC), in which a low-dimensionality vector quantizer is used in an adaptive predictive coding scheme. In the encoding process, a locally generated prediction of the current input vector is subtracted from the current vector, and the resulting error vector is coded by a vector quantizer. Each frame consisting of many vectors is classified into one of m statistical types. This classification determines which one of m fixed predictors and of m vector quantizers will be used for encoding the current frame."

The goal of such a system is data compression: to reduce the bit rate so as to minimize communication channel capacity or digital storage memory requirements while maintaining the necessary fidelity of the data. The mapping for each vector may or may not have memory in the sense of depending on past actions of the coder, just as in well established scalar techniques such as PCM, which has no memory, and predictive quantization, which does. Even though information theory implies that one can always obtain better performance by coding vectors instead of scalars, scalar quantizers have remained by far the most common data compression system because of their simplicity and good performance when the communication rate is sufficiently large. In addition, relatively few design techniques have existed for vector quantizers. During the past few years several design algorithms have been developed for a variety of vector quantizers and the performance of these codes has been studied for speech waveforms, speech linear predictive parameter vectors, images, and several simulated random processes. It is the purpose of this article to survey some of these design techniques and their applications."

One approach to reducing storage and computation requirements is to organize the set of reproduction vectors as the Cartesian product of a vector codebook describing the shape of each reproduction vector and a scalar codebook describing the gain or energy. Such shape-gain vector quantizers can be applied both to waveform coding using a quadratic-error distortion measure and to voice coding using an Itakura-Saito distortion measure. In each case, the minimum distortion reproduction vector can be found by first selecting a shape code-word, and then, based on that choice, selecting a gain codeword. Several algorithms are presented for the design of shape-gain vector quantizers based on a traning sequence of data or a probabilistic model. The algorithms are used to design shape-gain vector quantizers for both the waveform coding and voice coding application. The quantizers are simulated, and their performance is compared to that of previously reported vector quantization systems."

This paper presents a new approach called vector quantization. For very low data rates, realistic experiments have shown that vector quantization can achieve a given level of average distortion with 15 to 20 fewer bits/frame than that required for the optimized scalar quantizing approaches presently in use. The vector quantizing approach is shown to be a mathematically and computationally tractable method which builds upon knowledge obtained in linear prediction analysis studies. This paper introduces the theory in a nonrigorous form, along with practical results to date and an extensive list of research topics for this new area of speech coding."

The key limitation of existing techniques is the very large randomly generated code books which must be stored, and the computational complexity of the associated encoding procedures. The quantization operation is decomposed into its rudimentary structural components. This leads to a simple and elegant approach to derive analytical properties of optimal quantizers. Some useful properties of quantizers and algorithmic approaches are given, which are relevant to the complexity of both storage and processing in the encoding operation. Highly disordered quantizers, which have been designed using a clustering algorithm, are considered. Finally, lattice quantizers are examined which circumvent the need for a code book by using a highly structured code based on lattices. The code vectors are algorithmically generated in a simple manner rather than stored in a code book, and fast algorithms perform the encoding algorithm with negligible complexity."

Such vector quantizers have been widely used in the areas of speech coding and speech recognition. The conventional vector quantizer utilizes only spectral shape information and essentially disregards the energy or gain term associated with the optimal LPC fit to the signal being modelled. In this paper we present a method of incorporating LPC spectral shape and energy into the codebook entries of the vector quantizer. To do this we postulate a distortion measure for comparing two LPC vectors which uses a weighted sum of an LPC shape distortion and a log energy distortion. Based on this combined distortion measure we have designed and studied vector quantizers of several sizes for use in isolated word speech recognition experiments. We have found that a fairly significant correlation exists between LPC shape and signal energy; hence a combined LPC shape plus energy vector quantizer with a given distortion requires far fewer codebook entries than one in which LPC shape and energy are quantized separately. Based on isolated word recognition tests on both a 10-digit and a 129 word airlines vocabulary, we have found improvements in recognition accuracy by using the VQ with both LPC shape and energy over that obtained using a VQ with LPC shape alone."

We list the maximally obtainable signal-to-quantization noise ratios for one-dimensional optimum (i.e. entropy-coded) quantizers in the important low bit-rate region. These results have been obtained by an iterative solution of a set of nonlinear equations. Additionally we have also computed the corresponding rate-distortion functions by employing the Blahut-algorithm. These latter results upperbound the performances of multi-dimensional quantization schemes, and a comparison with the former results indicates the penalty to be paid for restricting a coder to perform a one-dimensionai quantization. It will be shown that the differences can be significant in the low bit-rate region."

Although each of these sets provides equivalent information about the linear predictor, their properties under quantization are different. The results of a comparative study of the various parameter sets are reported. Specifically it is concluded that the reflection coefficients are the best set for use as transmission parameters. A more detailed investigation of the reflection coefficients is then carried out using a spectral sensitivity measure. A method of optimally quantizing the reflection coefficients is derived using a minimax spectral error criterion and the sensitivity analysis. The method consists of transforming the reflection coefficients to the so-called log area ratios and linearly quantizing them. A qualitative study on changes in pole locations due to quantization serves to corroborate the use of this optimal quantization. An optimal bit allocation strategy for the transmission parameters is also presented. The use of another spectral sensitivity measure renders logarithms of the ratios of normalized errors associated with linear predictors of successive orders as the optimal quantization parameters. Informal listening tests indicate that the use of log area ratios for quantization leads to better synthesis than the use of log error ratios."

Each of the m signals is a linear combination of the n original signals. The coefficients of this linear transformation, which constitute an m \\times n matrix, are constants of the coding scheme. For the purpose of decoding, the m signals are once more combined linearly into n output signals which approximate the input signals. The coefficients of the coding matrix which minimize the sum of the mean square differences between the original signals and the reconstructed ones are shown to be the components of the eigenvectors of the matrix of the correlation coefficients of the original signals. The decoding matrix is the transpose of the coding matrix. As an example, the coding scheme is applied to a channel vocoder in which speech is transmitted by means of a set of signals proportional to the speech energy in the various frequency bands. These signals are strongly correlated, and the coding results in a substantial reduction in the number of signals necessary to transmit highly articulate speech. The coding theory can be extended to include the minimization of the expectation of any positive definite quadratic function of the differences between the original and reconstructed signals. In addition, if the signals are Gaussian, the sum of the channel capacities necessary to transmit the transformed signals is shown to be equal to or less than that necessary to transmit the original signals."

It has been shown by Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large. The optimum quautization schemes for 2^{b} quanta, b=1,2, \\cdots, 7 , are given numerically for Gaussian and for Laplacian distribution of signal amplitudes."

A linear transformation (P) first converts the N dependent random variables into N independent random variables. These are then quantized, one at a time, in optimal fashion. The output of each quantizer is transmitted by a binary code. The total number of binary digits available for the block of N symbols is fixed. Finally, a second N \\times N linear transformation (R) constructs from the quantized values the best estimate (in a mean-square sense) of the original variables. It is shown that the best choice of R is R = p^{-1} , regardless of other considerations. If R = P^{-1} , the best choice for P is the transpose of the orthogonal matrix wich diagonalizes the moment matrix of the original (correlated) random variables. An approximate expression is obtained for the manner in which the available binary digits should be assigned to the N quantized variables, i.e., the manner in which the number of levels for each quantizer should be chosen. The final selection of the optimal set of quantizers then becomes a matter of a few simple trials. A number of examples are worked out and substantial improvements over single sample quantizing are attained with blocks of relatively short length."

                "text": "In 1948 W. R. Bennett used a companding model for nonuniform quantization and proposed the formula D \\: = \\: \\frac{1}{12N^{2}} \\: \\int \\: p(x) [ E(x) ]^{-2} \\dx for the mean-square quantizing error where N is the number of levels, p (x) is the probability density of the input, and E \\prime (x) is the slope of the compressor curve. The formula, an approximation based on the assumption that the number of levels is large and overload distortion is negligible, is a useful tool for analytical studies of quantization. This paper gives a heuristic argument generalizing Bennett's formula to block quantization where a vector of random variables is quantized. The approach is again based on the asymptotic situation where N , the number of quantized output vectors, is very large. Using the resulting heuristic formula, an optimization is performed leading to an expression for the minimum quantizing noise attainable for any block quantizer of a given block size k . The results are consistent with Zador's results and specialize to known results for the one- and two-dimensional cases and for the case of infinite block length (k \\rightarrow \\infty) . The same heuristic approach also gives an alternate derivation of a bound of Elias for multidimensional quantization. Our approach leads to a rigorous method for obtaining upper bounds on the minimum distortion for block quantizers. In particular, for k = 3 we give a tight upper bound that may in fact be exact. The idea of representing a block quantizer by a block \"compressor\" mapping followed with an optimal quantizer for uniformly distributed random vectors is also explored. It is not always possible to represent an optimal quantizer with this block companding model."

Such a coarse quantization of the prediction residual can produce audible quantizing noise in the reproduced speech signal at the receiver. This paper describes a new method of quantization for improving the speech quality. The improvement is obtained by center clipping the prediction residual and by fine quantization of the high-amplitude portions of the prediction residual. The threshold of center clipping is adjusted to provide encoding of the prediction residual at a specified bit rate. This method of quantization not only improves the speech quality by accurate quantization of the prediction residual when its amplitude is large but also allows encoding of the prediction residual at bit rates below 1 bit/sample."

                "text": "V ECTOR QUANTIZATION (VQ), a new direction in source coding, has recently emerged as a powerful and widely applicable coding technique. I t was first applied to analysis/synthesis of speech, and has allowed Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) rates to be dramatically reduced to 800 b/s with very slight reduction in quality, and further compressed to rates as low as 150 b/s while retaining intelligibility [ 1,2]. More recently, the technique has found its way to waveform coding [3-51, where its applicability and effectiveness is less obvious and not widely known. There is currently a great need for a low-complexity speech coder at the rate of 16 kb/s which attains essentially \u201ctoll\u201d quality, roughly equivalent to that of standard 64-kb/s log PCM codecs. Adaptive DPCM schemes can attain this quality with low complexity for the proposed 32 kb/s CCITT standard, but at 16 kb/s the quality of ADPCM or adaptive delta modulation schemes is inadequate. More powerful methods, such as subband coding or transform coding, are capable of producing acceptable speech quality at 16kb/s but have a much higher implementation complexity. The difficulty is further compounded by the need for a scheme that can handle both speech and voiceband data at the 16 kb/s rate. These two types of waveforms occupy the same bandwidth in the subscriber loop part of the telephone network, yet they have a widely different statistical character. Effective speech coding at this rate must be geared to the specific character of speech and must exploit our knowledge of human hearing. On the other hand, a waveform that carries data must be coded and later reconstructed so that a modem can still extract the data with an acceptably low error rate. This is purely a signal processing operation not involving human perception. Vector quantization appears to be a suitable coding technique which caters to this dual requirement. VQ may become the key to 16 kb/s coding; it may also lead to improved quality waveform coding at 8 or 9.6 kb/s. In this paper, we review recent results obtained in waveform coding of speech with vector quantization and"

The basic concept of these methods is to divide the speech into frequency components by a filter bank (sub-band coding), or by a suitable transform (transform coding), and then encode them using adaptive PCM. Three basic factors are involved in the design of these coders: 1) the type of the filter bank or transform, 2) the choice of bit allocation and noise shaping properties involved in bit allocation, and 3) the control of the step-size of the encoders. This paper reviews the basic aspects of the design of these three factors for sub-band and transform coders. Concepts of short-time analysis/synthesis are first discussed and used to establish a basic theoretical framework. It is then shown how practical realizations of subband and transform coding are interpreted within this framework. Principles of spectral estimation and models of speech production and perception are then discussed and used to illustrate how the \"side information\" can be most efficiently represented and utilized in the design of the coder (particularly the adaptive transform coder) to control the dynamic bit allocation and quantizer step-sizes. Recent developments and examples of the \"vocoder-driven\" adaptive transform coder for low bit-rate applications are then presented."

In this coding method, both the transmitter and the receiver estimate the signal's current value by linear prediction on the previously transmitted signal. The difference between this estimate and the true value of the signal is quantized, coded and transmitted to the receiver. At the receiver, the decoded difference signal is added to the predicted signal to reproduce the input speech signal. Because of the nonstationary nature of the speech signals, an adaptive linear predictor is used, which is readjusted periodically to minimize the mean-square error between the predicted and the true value of the signals. The predictive coding system was simulated on a digital computer. The predictor parameters, comprising one delay and nine other coefficients related to the signal spectrum, were readjusted every 5 milliseconds. The speech signal was sampled at a rate of 6.67 kHz, and the difference signal was quantized by a two-level quantizer with variable step size. Subjective comparisons with speech from a logarithmic PCM encoder (log-PCM) indicate that the quality of the synthesized speech signal from the predictive coding system is approximately equal to that of log-PCM speech encoded at 6 bits/sample. Preliminary studies suggest that the binary difference signal and the predictor parameters together can be transmitted at approximately 10 kilobits/second which is several times less than the bit rate required for log-PCM encoding with comparable speech quality."

The distortion is defined as the expected value of some function of the error between the input and the output of the quantizer. Equations are derived for the parameters of a quantizer with minimum distortion. The equations are not soluble without recourse to numerical methods, so an algorithm is developed to simplify their numerical solution. The case of an input signal with normally distributed amplitude and an expected squared error distortion measure is explicitly computed and values of the optimum quantizer parameters are tabulated. The optimization of a quantizer subject to the restriction that both input and output levels be equally spaced is also treated, and appropriate parameters are tabulated for the same case as above."

Prominent among these developments are the use of a three\u2010point pitch predictor, a pitch\u2010adaptive quantizer, entropy coding of the residual, and adaptive shaping of the quantization\u2010noise spectrum. APC systems produce high quality speech at around 16 kbit/s; their quality diminishes rapidly at 9.6 kbit/s or less. For those lower data rates, some form of baseband coding system becomes desirable. In such systems, a low\u2010frequency baseband is transmitted. The high\u2010frequency regeneration of the excitation spectrum from the baseband is of special importance. Traditional regeneration techniques have used some form of nonlinear distortion (usually rectification) of the baseband, followed by spectral flattening. We introduce a new set of regeneration based on duplication of the baseband spectrum at high frequencies. The audible signal distortions in rectification and spectral folding are compared."

We also argue that the Itakura-Saito and related distortions are well-suited computationally, mathematically, and intuitively for such applications."

It has been proven that they are equivalent in the sense that their optimum rate versus distortion performances are identical. Reviews of the aforementioned results and of work performed in the interim by several investigators are presented. Equations which must be satisfied by the thresholds of the minimum entropy quantizer that achieves a prescribed mean r th power distortion are derived, and an iterative procedure for solving them is developed. It is shown that these equations often have many families of solutions. In the case of the Laplacian distribution, for which we had previously shown that quantizers with uniformly spaced thresholds satisfy the equations when r=2 , other families of solutions with nonuniform spacing are exhibited. What had appeared to be a discrepancy between the performances of optimum permutation codes and minimum entropy quantizers is resolved by the resulting optimum quantizers, which span all entropy rates from zero to infinity."

                "text": "An 800 bit/s vector quantization linear predictive coding (LPC) vocoder has been developed. The recently developed LPC vector quantization theory is applied to reduce the bit rate for LPC coefficients coding by a factor of four. Branch search techniques and separation of voiced and unvoiced codebooks are applied for better algorithm efficiency. Differential coding is applied to reduce the bit rate for the pitch and gain parameters by one third. Formal subjective evaluation shows that the 800 bit/s vocoder preserves most of the intelligibility of an LPC system. It is also robust under different transmission error and acoustic conditions. Informal listening comparisons show the quality to be acceptable and sometimes very close to 2400 bit/s LPC speech. The computational cost of the 800 bit/s vocoder is equivalent to or even lower than the 2400 bit/s LPC-10. Compatibility with any LPC-10 vocoder is guaranteed because the 800 bit/s design only differs in the quantization and encoding algorithms. Further bit rate reduction can be achieved by removing frame to frame redundancy in the code."

In this paper, we review the recent work on adaptive predictive coding of speech signals, with particular emphasis on achieving high speech quality at low bit rates (less than 10 kbits/s). Efficient prediction of the redundant structure in speech signals is obviously important for proper functioning of a predictive coder. It is equally important to ensure that the distortion in the coded speech signal be perceptually small. The subjective loudness of quantization noise depends both on the short-time spectrum of the noise and its relation to the short-time spectrum of the Speech signal. The noise in the formant regions is partially masked by the speech signal itself. This masking of quantization noise by speech signal allows one to use low bit rates while maintaining high speech quality. This paper will present generalizations of predictive coding for minimizing subjective distortion in the reconstructed speech signal at the receiver. The quantizer in predictive coders quantizes its input on a sample-by-sample basis. Such sample-by-sample (instantaneous) quantization creates difficulty in realizing an arbitrary noise spectrum, particularly at low bit rates. We will describe a new class of speech coders in this paper which could be considered to be a generalization of the predictive coder. These new coders not only allow one to realize the precise optimum noise spectrum which is crucial to achieving very low bit rates, but also represent the important first step in bridging the gap between waveform coders and vocoders without suffering from their limitations."

Some of the original speech had been corrupted by noise and distortions typical of long-distance telephone lines. The basic structure chosen for our system was adaptive predictive coding. However, the rigorous requirements of this work led to a new outlook on the different aspects of adaptive predictive coding. We have found that the pitch predictor is not cost-effective on balance and may be eliminated. Solutions are presented to deal with the two types of quantization noise: clipping and granular noise. The clipping problem is completely eliminated by allowing the number of quantizer levels to increase indefinitely. An appropriate self-synchronizing variable-length code is proposed to minimize the average data rate; the coding scheme seems to be adequate for all speech and all conditions tested. The granular noise problem is treated by modifying the predictive coding system in a novel manner to include an adaptive noise spectral shaping filter. A design for such a filter is proposed that effectively eliminates the perception of granular noise."

It can be viewed as an adaptive vector quantizer with backward estimation, a vector generalization of an AQB system. Recently a family of algorithms for the design of FSVQ's for waveform coding application has been introduced. These algorithms first design an initial set of vector quantizers together with a next-state function giving the rule by which the next quantizer is selected. The codebooks of this initial FSVQ are then iteratively improved by a natural extension of the usual memoryless vector quantizer design algorithm. The next-state function, however, is not modified from its initial form. In this paper we present two extensions of the FSVQ design algorithms. First, the algorithm for FSVQ design for waveform coders is extended to FSVQ design of linear predictive coded (LPC) speech parameter vectors using an Itakura-Saito distortion measure. Second, we introduce a new technique for the iterative improvement of the next-state function based on an algorithm from adaptive stochastic automata theory. The design algorithms are simulated for an LPC FSVQ and the results are compared with each other and to ordinary memoryless vector quantization. Several open problems suggested by the simulation results are presented."

We first demonstrate that tree codes are inherent in A-D speech convertors of the waveform following type and point to ordinary and adaptive delta modulation and differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) as examples. Insights of coding theory improve these trees at low rates; we offer two new code classes, one obtained by smoothing the DPCM tree and one using the rate-distortion theory of autoregressive sources. Using these codes, we study the performance of a simple synchronous tree searching algorithm called the M -algorithm that maintains a small fixed number of paths in contention. 1 and 2 bit/sample code trees, used to encode actual speech at 8, 10, and 16 kbits/s, yield improved dynamic range and channel error resistance, and 4-8 dB improvement in mean-square error (mse) over ordinary single-path searched DPCM. These improvements in excess of analytical estimates suggest that tree coding methods perform better with real-life sources than previously thought."

It compares several transforms and shows that the cosine transform leads to a nearly optimum performance for almost all speech sounds. Various adaptive coding strategies are then investigated, and a coding scheme is proposed that is based on a nonadaptive discrete cosine transform (DCT), on an adaptive bit assignment, and on adaptive quantization. The adaptation is controlled by a short-term basis spectrum that is derived from the transform coefficients prior to coding and transmission and that is transmitted as side information to the receiver. The main result is that this adaptive transform coder performs better than all known nonpitch-tracking coding schemes; it extends the range of speech waveform coding to lower bit rates and closes the gap between vocoders and predictive waveform coders."

However, the human ear does not perceive signal distortion on the basis of r.m.s. error regardless of its spectral shape relative to the signal spectrum. Specifically, for speech signals, the locations of the formant frequencies and their rates of change with time influence the audibility, and thus the subjective distortion of any quantizing noise. In this paper, methods for reducing the subjective distortion in predictive coders for speech siganls are described and evaluated. Improved speech quality is obtained a) by efficient removal of formant and pitch related redundant structure of speech before quantizing and b) by effective masking of the quantizer noise by the speech signal."

The adaptation is accomplished by continuous alteration of the the template set to match the current speaker and environment. The distance measure approximates auditory perception to optimize the template usage. Adaptation protocols requiring no additional channel bandwidth have been devised. The system achieves an intelligibility score (DRT) of 86.8 percent on an 800 bps channel. Combinations of this system with spectral frame-fill produce systems with data rates as low as 500 bps at somewhat reduced intelligibility."

This model is often inadequate and leads to suboptimal bit allocations for actual quantizer characteristics. This inadequacy prevails particularly in coding systems based on vector quantization (VQ). The distortion-rate characteristic for VQ suffers from irregularities because of suboptimality of the codebook and of the codebook search method. We propose a new algorithm which efficiently allocates a given quota of bits, based on the actually measured quantizer performance, without any prior assumptions on its behavior. The algorithm can enhance the performance-of traditional scalar coders as well as any modern coder which employs dynamic bit allocation."

The basic idea consists of using a dictionary of K indexed waveforms of fixed duration T (where T lies between 1 and 4 ms). The input signal is broken down into blocks of duration T. For each segment the Dictionary is searched for that prototype waveform which is, with respect to some distance measure, the closest to the input block. The digital representation of the signal is thereafter the index of the prototype. The paper addresses the problem of the judicious choice of distance measures and the design of a good dictionary. Experimental results are provided for dictionary coding of the signal using a distance measure combining time and frequency domain features. Experimental results are further presented for the coding of the LPC residual."

For a general distortion criterion, necessary conditions are developed for optimality and a recursive algorithm is described for obtaining the optimum quantizer. Under a mean-square error criterion, the performance of entropy encoded uniform quantization of memoryless Gaussian sources is well-known to be within 0.255 bits/sample of the rate-distortion bound at relatively high rates. Despite claims to the contrary, it is demonstrated that similar performance can be expected for a wide range of memoryless sources. Indeed, for the cases considered, the worst case performance is observed to be less than 0.3 bits/sample from the rate-distortion bound, and in most cases this disparity is less at Iow rates."

This is done in the framework of a standard statistical pattern recognition model. Both the vector quantizer and the hidden Markov models need to be trained for the vocabulary being recognized. Such training results in a distinct hidden Markov model for each word of the vocabulary. Classification consists of computing the probability of generating the test word with each word model and choosing the word model that gives the highest probability. There are several factors, in both the vector quantizer and the hidden Markov modeling, that affect the performance of the overall word recognition system, including the size of the vector quantizer, the structure of the hidden Markov model, the ways of handling insufficient training data, etc. The effects, on recognition accuracy, of many of these factors are discussed in this paper. The entire recognizer (training and testing) has been evaluated on a 10-word digits vocabulary. For training, a set of 100 talkers spoke each of the digits one time. For testing, an independent set of 100 tokens of each of the digits was obtained. The overall recognition accuracy was found to be 96.5 percent for the 100-talker test set. These results are comparable to those obtained in earlier work, using a dynamic time-warping recognition algorithm with multiple templates per digit. It is also shown that the computation and storage requirements of the new recognizer were an order of magnitude less than that required for a conventional pattern recognition system using linear prediction with dynamic time warping."

The set of log area ratios has been shown to be one of the best coefficient sets when quantization considerations are concerned. In this paper an optimal scheme for quantizing the log area ratios is derived based on a mean-square spectral distortion criteron. The quantization of the log area ratios is compared to the quantization of the set of coefficients resulting from the Karhunen-Loeve transform of the log area ratios. Experimental data is presented which indicates that little, if any, bit rate reduction is obtained through use of this transform."

Separate VQ codebooks were designed for each word in the recognition vocabulary, and input words were classified by performing VQ and finding the codebook that achieves the smallest average distortion. The method obviates time-normalization and makes no use of time-sequence information. This paper presents results for a generalization that incorporates time-sequence information. The generalization, which was motivated by work of Martinez, Riveria, and Buzo, is more accurate and faster than the previous method. Words in the training and input sequences are normalized linearly to the same length and then divided into sections. Separate VQ codebooks are designed for each section of each vocabulary word. Each vocabulary word is then represented by a \"multisection\" codebook - a time-dependent sequence of section-codebooks. New words are classified by performing VQ and finding the multi-section codebook that achieves the smallest average distortion. Initial tests on a twenty-word vocabulary resulted in accuracies greater than 97% for speaker-independent recognition."

To minimize the bit rate, one would want to use a high-order chain. Unfortunately, a high-order chain would require an inordinate amount of data for training. We describe in this paper the use of a variable order Markov chain that maximizes the effective use of a given amount of speech data. To reduce the number of states of a high-order chain, we define an equivalence relation on the states, i.e., \"similar\" states are grouped together in an equivalence class and a single conditional distribution is associated with the equivalence class. We introduce two equivalence relations. In the first, called variable order Markov chain, the equivalence classes represent the most probable states of any order. In the second method, called variable resolution, the equivalence class is obtained by decreasing the quantization accuracy in representing a spectrum that belongs to a more remote past. For an LPC vocoder with 64 possible spectra (using 6-bit vector quantization), the second method is superior to the first and decreases the entropy from 6 bits to 4 bits per spectrum with 256 equivalence classes."

This approach yields valuable new insights regarding the computation of channel capacities and rate-distortion functions. In particular, it suggests a simple algorithm for computing channel capacity that consists of a mapping from the set of channel input probability vectors into itself such that the sequence of probability vectors generated by successive applications of the mapping converges to the vector that achieves the capacity of the given channel. Analogous algorithms then are provided for computing rate-distortion functions and constrained channel capacities. The algorithms apply both to discrete and to continuous alphabet channels or sources. In addition, a formalization of the theory of channel capacity in the presence of constraints is included. Among the examples is the calculation of close upper and lower bounds to the rate-distortion function of a binary symmetric Markov source."

This paper explains the performances of these coders and compares them both with those of conventional coders and with rate-distortion bounds.

In the original vocoder we used a random sample of vectors as a set of templates for vector quantization. We demonstrate in this paper that this random quantizer is near-optimal by comparing it with quantizers that use clustering algorithms for quantizing speech segments. The reduction of the bit rate of the segment vocoder was achieved primarily by using a segment network, i.e., not all segment templates are allowed to follow a given segment template. The spectral continuity of speech is used to determine the subset of templates, that can be used to quantize an input segment. To achieve the low rate of 150 b/s, we also reduced the bit rate for coding pitch, gain, and segment duration. Finally, we present the bit allocation used for transmitting speech at 150 b/s as a single speaker segment vocoder."

A time-varying image, which is a function of three independent variables, must be sampled in at least two dimensions for transmission over a one-dimensional analog communication channel, and in three dimensions for digital processing and transmission. At the receiver, the sampled image must be interpolated to reconstruct a continuous function of space and time. In imagery destined for human viewing, the visual system forms an integral part of the reconstruction process. This paper presents an overview of the theory of sampling and reconstruction of multidimensional signals. The concept of sampling structures based on lattices is introduced. The important problem of conversion between different sampling structures is also treated. This theory is then applied to the sampling of time-varying imagery, including the role of the camera and display apertures, and the human visual system. Finally, a class of nonlinear interpolation algorithms which adapt to the motion in the scene is presented."

We limit the discussion to vocoders that transmit information for single frames (as opposed to whole segments of speech). We start with vector quantization, which reduces the bit rate to around 800 b/s accompanied by a significant but tolerable loss in quality relative to a typical fixed-rate 2400 b/s vocoder. Then we reduce the frame rate using one of two techniques: Fixed-Rate Transmission with Variable Interpolation, or Optimal Variable-Frame-Rate Transmission. We also reduce the data rate necessary for the source parameters (pitch, voicing, gain) from 400 b/s to about 100 b/s by taking advantage of their statistical dependence on the spectrum and some perceptual factors. The final result at 300 b/s has a quality comparable to that of the fixed-rate 800 b/s vector quantization vocoder. At 400 b/s, the quality is, in many respects, better than that of the 800 b/s vocoder and comparable to the 2400 b/s LPC vocoder."

The piecewise approximation of the speech spectrum permits a higher spectral accuracy than standard LPC and reduces the computational load by about 40%. The full residual excitation overcomes the disadvantages of the base-band model, previously used at this bitrate. Finally, the vector quantization approach permits a dramatic bit saving over scalar quantization for LPC parameter compression, and provides a better distortion performance in the residual representation."

This R&D effort was motivated by the pressing need for very-low-data rate (VLDR) voice digitizers to meet some of the current military voice communication requirements. The use of a VLDR voice digitizer makes it possible to transmit speech signals over adverse channels which support data rates of only a few hundred bps, or to transmit speech signals over more favorable channels with redundancies for error protection and other useful applications. The 600 bps synthesized speech loses some of its original speech quality, but the intelligibility is sufficiently high to permit the use of the system in certain specialized military applications. One of the most attractive features of the 600 bps voice digitizer is that it is a simple extension of the 2400 bps linear predictive encoder (LPE) which has been under intensive investigation by various government agencies, including the Navy, and is presently entering advanced development. In essence, the 600 bps voice digitizer is a combination of an LPE and a format vocoder, which is realized by adding a processor to the existing 2400 bps LPE. This add-on processor converts the 2400 bps speech data to 600 bps speech data at the transmitter, and reconverts the data to 2400 bps at the receiver."

The SNR shows an 8\u2010dB bias for PCM coding, i.e., the SNR of the PCM has to exceed the SNR of ADPCM by 8 dB before the two are judged to be equally preferable. In contrast, the segmental SNR shows no such bias. The segmental SNR is considered a better perceptual model since it evaluates the quantization noise with respect to the energy in each underlying speech segment."

In the VFR method, parameters are transmitted only when their values have changed sufficiently over the interval since their preceding transmission. We explored two distinct approaches to automatic implementation of the VFR method. The first approach bases the transmission decisions on comparisons of the parameter values of the present frame and the last transmitted frame. The second approach, which is based on a functional perceptual model of speech, compares the parameter values of all the frames that lie in the interval between the present frame and the last transmitted frame against a linear model of parameter variation over that interval. The application of VFR transmission to the design of narrow-band LPC speech coders with average bit rates of 2000-2400 bits/s is also considered. The transmission decisions are made separately for the three sets of LPC parameters, pitch, gain, and spectral parameters, using separate VFR schemes. A formal subjective spccch quality test of six selected LPC coders is described, and the results are presented and analyzed in detail. It is shown that a 2075 bit/s VFR coder produces speech quality equal to or better than that of a 5700 bit/s fixed frame rate coder."

Each sample of the innovation sequence is filtered sequentially through two time-varying linear recursive filters, one with a long-delay (related to pitch period) predictor in the feedback loop and the other with a short-delay predictor (related to spectral envelope) in the feedback loop. We code speech, sampled at 8 kHz, in blocks of 5-msec duration. Each block consisting of 40 samples is produced from one of 1024 possible innovation sequences. The bit rate for the innovation sequence is thus 1/4 bit per sample. We compare in this paper several different random and deterministic code books for their effectiveness in providing the optimum innovation sequence in each block. Our results indicate that a random code book has a slight speech quality advantage at low bit rates. Examples of speech produced by the above method will be played at the conference."

The signal is modeled as a linear combination of its past values and present and past values of a hypothetical input to a system whose output is the given signal. In the frequency domain, this is equivalent to modeling the signal spectrum by a pole-zero spectrum. The major part of the paper is devoted to all-pole models. The model parameters are obtained by a least squares analysis in the time domain. Two methods result, depending on whether the signal is assumed to be stationary or nonstationary. The same results are then derived in the frequency domain. The resulting spectral matching formulation allows for the modeling of selected portions of a spectrum, for arbitrary spectral shaping in the frequency domain, and for the modeling of continuous as well as discrete spectra. This also leads to a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the least squares error criterion. A spectral interpretation is given to the normalized minimum prediction error. Applications of the normalized error are given, including the determination of an \"optimal\" number of poles. The use of linear prediction in data compression is reviewed. For purposes of transmission, particular attention is given to the quantization and encoding of the reflection (or partial correlation) coefficients. Finally, a brief introduction to pole-zero modeling is given."

System operation for voiced frames depends upon the development of a set of reference clusters in the 4-dimensional spaces of resonance frequencies and spectral magnitudes; synthesis is performed with parallel resonators using the spectral representations for these clusters, with resonance bandwidths inserted according to rule. For nonvoiced frames clustering is done on log-area-ratios, with speech synthesized by a PARCOR filter. An extensive analysis of speech data was performed to obtain parameter quantization tables necessary for operation at rates from 1600 to 711 bits/sec.

                "text": "The excitation for LPC speech synthesis usually consists of two separate signals - a delta-function pulse once every pitch period for voiced speech and white noise for unvoiced speech. This manner of representing excitation requires that speech segments be classified accurately into voiced and unvoiced categories and the pitch period of voiced segments be known. It is now well recognized that such a rigid idealization of the vocal excitation is often responsible for the unnatural quality associated with synthesized speech. This paper describes a new approach to the excitation problem that does not require a priori knowledge of either the voiced-unvoiced decision or the pitch period. All classes of sounds are generated by exciting the LPC filter with a sequence of pulses; the amplitudes and locations of the pulses are determined using a non-iterative analysis-by-synthesis procedure. This procedure minimizes a perceptual-distance metric representing subjectively-important differences between the waveforms of the original and the synthetic speech signals. The distance metric takes account of the finite-frequency resolution as well as the differential sensitivity of the human ear to errors in the formant and inter-formant regions of the speech spectrum."

The root mean square (rms) log spectral distance, cepstral distance, likelihood ratio (minimum residual principle or delta coding (DELCO) algorithm), and a cosh measure (based upon two nonsymmetrical likelihood ratios) are considered. It is shown that the cepstral measure bounds the rms log spectral measure from below, while the cosh measure bounds it from above. A simple nonlinear transformation of the likelihood ratio is shown to be highly correlated with the rms log spectral measure over expected ranges. Relationships between distance measure values and perception are also considered. The likelihood ratio, cepstral measure, and cosh measure are easily evaluated recursively from linear prediction filter coefficients, and each has a meaningful and interrelated frequency domain interpretation. Fortran programs are presented for computing the recursively evaluated distance measures."

The design problem of selecting the optimum set of predictors with respect to the overall prediction gain is formulated and an iterative procedure is described to obtain the solutions. The relative prediction-gain improvement is computed for a 3 sec. speech sample and for several values of L,M, and block size showing that \\frac{1}{2} of the adaptative over fixed-prediction improvement in dB is reached with only L=4 and 2/3 with L=8 . The design problem solved by minimizing Itakura distance is shown to yield essentially identical performances. A linear discriminant property in the autocorrelation space is pointed out. Based on that property a pattern classification approach is proposed as an hardware-efficient coding algorithm."

A reference pattern for each word to be recognized is stored as a time pattern of linear prediction coefficients (LPC). The total log prediction residual of an input signal is minimized by optimally registering the reference LPC onto the input autocorrelation coefficients using the dynamic programming algorithm (DP). The input signal is recognized as the reference word which produces the minimum prediction residual. A sequential decision procedure is used to reduce the amount of computation in DP. A frequency normalization with respect to the long-time spectral distribution is used to reduce effects of variations in the frequency response of telephone connections. The system has been implemented on a DDP-516 computer for the 200-word recognition experiment. The recognition rate for a designated male talker is 97.3 percent for telephone input, and the recognition time is about 22 times real time."

The unit uses an LPC-10 algorithm which provides a 2400 bps NATO standard compatible mode and a 1200 bps frame-fill mode. The unit has an RS-449 digital interface with MIL-STD-188-114 levels. The user operates the unit from a telephone instrument with a PTT handset. The user interface models an augmented combination of an FM transceiver and a telephone to inform the user of the state of the data communications equipment in a natural manner. These protocols cover the full and half duplex channels. The unit exhibits a DRT (intelligibility) score of 91.1% at 2400 bps and 88.7% at 1200 bps in benign acoustic environments. (Author)"

Research laboratories and universities reported broad use. Published reviews-some twenty-five in number-were universally kind. Subsequently the book was translated and published in Russian (Svyaz; Moscow, 1968) and Spanish (Gredos, S.A.; Madrid, 1972). Copies of the first edition have been exhausted for several years, but demand for the material continues. At the behest of the publisher, and with the encouragement of numerous colleagues, a second edition was begun in 1970. The aim was to retain the original format, but to expand the content, especially in the areas of digital communications and com puter techniques for speech signal processing. As before, the intended audience is the graduate-Ievel engineer and physicist, but the psycho physicist, phonetician, speech scientist and linguist should find material of interest.\""

In particular, we present improvements that deal with the problems of modeling the effect of phonetic context and the problem of robust pdf estimation. The effect of phonetic context is taken into account by conditioning the probability density functions (pdfs) of the acoustic parameters on the adjacent phonemes, only to the extent that there are sufficient tokens of the phoneme in that context. This partial conditioning is achieved by combining the conditioned and unconditioned pdfs models with weights that depend on the confidence in each pdf estimate. This combination is shown to result in better performance than either model by itself. We also show that it is possible to obtain the computational advantages of using discrete probability densities without the usual requirement for large amounts of training data."

                "text": "The past decade has witnessed substantial progress toward the goal of constructing a machine capable of understanding colloquial discourse. Central to this progress has been the development and application of mathematical methods that permit modeling the speech signal as a complex code with several coexisting levels of structure. The most successful of these are \"template matching,\" stochastic modeling, and probabilistic parsing. The manifestation of common themes such as dynamic programming and finite-state descriptions accentuates a superficial likeness amongst the methods which is often mistaken for the deeper similarity arising from their shared Bayesian foundation. In this paper, we outline the mathematical bases of these methods, invariant metrics, hidden Markov chains, and formal grammars, respectively. We then recount and briefly interpret the results of experiments in speech recognition to which the various methods were applied. Since these mathematical principles seem to bear little resemblance to traditional linguistic characterizations of speech, the success of the experiments is occasionally attributed, even by their authors, merely to excellent engineering. We conclude by speculating that, quite to the contrary, these methods actually constitute a powerful theory of speech that can be reconciled with and elucidate conventional linguistic theories while being used to build truly competent mechanical speech recognizers."

Combined, these algorithms allow the automatic design of a trellis encoding system for a particular source. The algorithms' effectiveness for random sources is demonstrated through performance comparisons with other source coding systems and with theoretical bounds.

                "text": "The main purpose of this paper is to describe a process for partitioning an N-dimensional population into k sets on the basis of a sample. The process, which is called 'k-means,' appears to give partitions which are reasonably efficient in the sense of within-class variance. That is, if p is the probability mass function for the population, S = {S1, S2, * *, Sk} is a partition of EN, and ui, i = 1, 2, * , k, is the conditional mean of p over the set Si, then W2(S) = ff=ISi f z u42 dp(z) tends to be low for the partitions S generated by the method. We say 'tends to be low,' primarily because of intuitive considerations, corroborated to some extent by mathematical analysis and practical computational experience. Also, the k-means procedure is easily programmed and is computationally economical, so that it is feasible to process very large samples on a digital computer. Possible applications include methods for similarity grouping, nonlinear prediction, approximating multivariate distributions, and nonparametric tests for independence among several variables. In addition to suggesting practical classification methods, the study of k-means has proved to be theoretically interesting. The k-means concept represents a generalization of the ordinary sample mean, and one is naturally led to study the pertinent asymptotic behavior, the object being to establish some sort of law of large numbers for the k-means. This problem is sufficiently interesting, in fact, for us to devote a good portion of this paper to it. The k-means are defined in section 2.1, and the main results which have been obtained on the asymptotic behavior are given there. The rest of section 2 is devoted to the proofs of these results. Section 3 describes several specific possible applications, and reports some preliminary results from computer experiments conducted to explore the possibilities inherent in the k-means idea. The extension to general metric spaces is indicated briefly in section 4. The original point of departure for the work described here was a series of problems in optimal classification (MacQueen [9]) which represented special"

In contrast to other reported approaches to this problem, the method employed involves a great deal of perceptual feedback from the experimenter, who incorporates patterns into the pattern set from a new sentence by first listening to the sentence as processed through the complete system. By identifying those portions of the processed sentence that have been degraded, he can augment the pattern set with only those frames that were degraded. The preliminary results indicate that a system with 500 patterns plus volume normalization, resulting in a 550 bits per second rate for spectral transmission, yields reasonably good synthetic speech."
