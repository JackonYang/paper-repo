Our approach is primarily distinguished by two features: (1) the adoption of an average-case setting to model the ``typical'' labeling of a finite automaton, while retaining a worst-case model for the underlying graph of the automaton, along with (2) a learning model in which the learner is not provided with the means to experiment with the machine, but rather must learn solely by observing the automaton's output behavior on a random input sequence. The main contribution of this paper is in presenting the first efficient algorithms for learning nontrivial classes of automata in an entirely passive learning model. We adopt an on-line learning model in which the learner is asked to predict the output of the next state, given the next symbol of the random input sequence; the goal of the learner is to make as few prediction mistakes as possible. Assuming the learner has a means of resetting the target machine to a fixed start state, we first present an efficient algorithm that article no. IC972648"

The notion of an information source that simplifies and sharpens the traditional one is axiomatized, and adaptive and nonadaptive models are defined. With a measure of complexity assigned to the models, a fundamental theorem is proved which states that models that use any kind of alphabet extension are inferior to the best models using no alphabet extensions at all. A general class of so-called first-in first-out (FIFO) arithmetic codes is described which require no alphabet extension devices and which therefore can be used in conjunction with the best models. Because the coding parameters are the probabilities that define the model, their design is easy, and the application of the code is straightforward even with adaptively changing source models."

This HMM includes states that model the codons and their frequencies in E. coli genes, as well as the patterns found in the intergenic region, including repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences and the Shine-Delgarno motif. To account for potential sequencing errors and or frameshifts in raw genomic DNA sequence, it allows for the (very unlikely) possibility of insertions and deletions of individual nucleotides within a codon. The parameters of the HMM are estimated using approximately one million nucleotides of annotated DNA in EcoSeq6 and the model tested on a disjoint set of contigs containing about 325,000 nucleotides. The HMM finds the exact locations of about 80% of the known E. coli genes, and approximate locations for about 10%. It also finds several potentially new genes, and locates several places were insertion or deletion errors/and or frameshifts may be present in the contigs."
