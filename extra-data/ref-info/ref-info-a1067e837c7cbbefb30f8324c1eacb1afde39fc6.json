                "text": "Suppose on a smooth Riemannian manifold M one has a graph G such that each edge of G is a geodesic segment. Additionally, suppose to each edge is associated a positive density or \"tension\" so that at each vertex of G the tangent vector sum of the tension forces acting there is zero. Such a geodesic graph with densities is a heuristic model for stationary 1-dimensional varifolds in M. In this paper we examine the analytic and geometric structure of quite general stationary 1-dimensional varifolds and seek, among other things, conditions sufficient to imply such a graph structure. In [PJ] it was shown, for example, that the stationary 1-dimensional integral varifolds arising from variational methods in the large have such structure with positive integer densities. On the other hand [AA, Example 2, p. 256] illustrates a stationary 1-dimensional varifold in IR 2 which has such graph structure except at one point of infinite complexity. In general, a stationary 1-dimensional varifold Vneed not lie on a 1-dimensional set (since, for example, stationarity is preserved under convolution with smoothing functions [BK 4.3]). However, if the 1-dimensional densities of V are bounded away from 0, then V must lie on a 1-dimensional set [FH 2.10.19(3)]; moreover, as we show in Section 3, both geometrically and measure theoretically V is then the sum of geodesic segments with densities, and in case the set of densities which occurs is discrete this sum is locally finite. The example constructed in Section 4 shows that without the discreteness assumption the sum can be locally infinite (the example in [AA] above did not have a positive lower density bound). Even without the discreteness assumption we are able to show in Section 5 that at every point (even those of infinite local complexity) V admits a unique varifold tangent consisting of a finite number of half lines with densities."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

Its scope has been extended in many directions, and very recent developments, of which a substantial number are due to the authors, receive a fair share of attention. The volume now gives a somewhat exhaustive account of the various ramifications of the subject, which are set out in an attractive manner. An unusually complete set of references is included, and the book should become indispensable, not only as a textbook for advanced students, but as a work of reference to those whose aim is to extend our knowledge of analysis. The references to original memoirs are conveniently arranged at the ends of the chapters.A Course of Modern Analysis.By Prof. E. T. Whittaker Prof. G. N. Watson. Second edition, completely revised.
