Central to any mediator that accesses Web-based sources is a set of wrappers that can extract relevant information from Web pages. In this paper, we present a wrapper-induction algorithm that generates extraction rules for Web-based information sources. We introduce landmark automata, a formalism that describes classes of extraction rules. Our wrapper induction algorithm, STALKER, generates extraction rules that are expressed as simple landmark grammars, which are a class of landmark automata that is more expressive than the existing extraction languages. Based on just a few training examples STALKER learns extraction rules for documents with multiple levels of embedding. The experimental results show that our approach successfully wraps classes of documents that can not be wrapped by existing techniques."

In a mediator based approach, wrappers are built around individual information sources to translate between the mediator query language and the individual sources. They present an approach for semi-automatically generating wrappers for structured Internet sources. The key idea is to exploit formatting information in Web pages to hypothesize the underlying structure of a page. From this structure the system generates a wrapper that facilitates querying of a source and possibly integrating it with other sources. They demonstrate the ease with which they are able to build wrappers for a number of Web sources using their implemented wrapper generation toolkit."

As the majority of electronic documents available over the network are in unstructured textual form, extracting useful information from a document usually involves information retrieval techniques or manual processing. This paper presents a novel approach to mining information from HTML documents using tree-structured templates. In addition to syntactic and semantic descriptions, each template is designed to capture the logical structure of a class of documents. Experiments have been conducted to extract FAQ information automatically from over one hundred HTML documents collected from the Web. Using two basic templates, the prototype FAQ Miner has accurately analyzed 65% of the collection of FAQ documents. With additional processing to handle \"near-pass\" es, the success rate is approximately 75%. The preliminary results have demonstrated the utility of structural templates for mining information from semi-structured text-based documents."

                "text": "The WorldWideWeb is less agent-friendly than we might hope. Most information on the Web is presented in loosely structured natural language text with no agent-readable semantics. HTML annotations structure the display of Web pages, but provide virtually no insight into their content. Thus, the designers of intelligent Web agents need to address the following questions: (1) To what extent can an agent understand information published at Web sites? (2) Is the agent's understanding sufficient to provide genuinely useful assistance to users? (3) Is site-specific hand-coding necessary, or can the agent automatically extract information from unfamiliar Web sites? (4) What aspects of the Web facilitate this competence? In this paper we investigate these issues with a case study using ShopBot, a fully-implemented, domainindependent comparison-shopping agent. Given the home pages of several online stores, ShopBot autonomously learns how to shop at those vendors. After learning, it is able to speedily visit over a dozen software and CD vendors, extract product information, and summarize the results for the user. Preliminary studies show that ShopBot enables users to both find superior prices and substantially reduce Web shopping time. Remarkably, ShopBot achieves this performance without sophisticated natural language processing, and requires only minimal knowledge about different product domains. Instead, ShopBot relies on a combination of heuristic search, pattern matching, and inductive learning techniques.

Work in multidatabase systems has begun to address this problem, but it has primarily focused on methods for communicating between databases and requires significant effort for each new database added to the system. This paper describes a more general approach that exploits a semantic model of a problem domain to integrate the information from various information sources. The information sources handled include both databases and knowledge bases, and other information sources (e.g. programs) could potentially be incorporated into the system. This paper describes how both the domain and the information sources are modeled, shows how a query at the domain level is mapped into a set of queries to individual information sources, and presents algorithms for automatically improving the efficiency of queries using knowledge about both the domain and the information sources. This work is implemented in a system called SIMS and has been tested in a transportation planning domain using nine Oracle databases and a Loom knowledge base."

In some forms of semistructured data there is no separate schema, in others it exists but only places loose constraints on the data. Semistructured data has recently emerged as an important topic of study for a variety of reasons. First, there are data sources such as the Web, which we would like to treat as databases but which cannot be constrained by a schema. Second, it may be desirable to have an extremely flexible format for data exchange between disparate databases. Third, even when dealing with structured data, it may be helpful to view it. as semistructured for the purposes of browsing. This tutorial will cover a number of issues surrounding such data: finding a concise formulation, building a sufficiently expressive language for querying and transformation, and optimizat,ion problems."

Occam has several important features: (1) it integrates both legacy systems and full relational databases with an e cient, domain-independent, query-planning algorithm, (2) it reasons about the capabilities of di erent information sources, (3) it handles partial goal satisfaction i.e., gathers as much data as possible when it can't gather exactly all that the user requested, (4) it is both sound and complete, (5) it is e cient.

The contributing authors comprise an impressive collection -- essentially the originating sources for much of the important recent work in this area.\" \n-- Philip Resnik, Assistant Professor, Department of Linguistics and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies, University of Maryland at College Park Finite-state devices, which include finite-state automata, graphs, and finite-state transducers, are in wide use in many areas of computer science. Recently, there has been a resurgence of the use of finite-state devices in all aspects of computational linguistics, including dictionary encoding, text processing, and speech processing. This book describes the fundamental properties of finite-state devices and illustrates their uses. Many of the contributors pioneered the use of finite-automata for different aspects of natural language processing. The topics, which range from the theoretical to the applied, include finite-state morphology, approximation of phrase-structure grammars, deterministic part-of-speech tagging, application of a finite-state intersection grammar, a finite-state transducer for extracting information from text, and speech recognition using weighted finite automata. The introduction presents the basic theoretical results in finite-state automata and transducers. These results and algorithms are described and illustrated with simple formal language examples as well as natural language examples. \nContributors: Douglas Appelt, John Bear, David Clemenceau, Maurice Gross, Jerry R.

Translators (wrappers) convert queries over information in the common del (OEM) into requests the source can execute. The data returned by the source is converted back into the common model. Mediators are programs that collect information from one or more sources, process and combine it, and export the resulting information to the end user or an application program. Users or applications can choose to interact either directly with the translators or indirectly via one or more mediators. End users can access information either by writing applications that request OEM objects, or by using one of the generic browsing tools we have developed: a graphical user interface based on DOS and Microsoft Windows, a UNIX-based textual interface, and a graphical interface based on the HTTP protocol called mobie (MOsaic-Based Information Explorer) 1 . Our demo uses mobie since it is the most interesting of the three. mobie is a platform-independent tool for displaying and exploring OEM objects that are returned as a result of queries. mobie provides a mechanism for This work was supported by ARPA Contract F33615-93-11339, by the Anderson Faculty Scholar Fund, by the Center for Integrated Systems at Stanford University, and by equipment grants from Digital Equipment Corporation and IBM Corporporation"

When information is combined from multiple databases, the major concern is the mismatch encountered in information representation and structure. Intelligent and active use of information requires a class of software modules that mediate between the workstation applications and the databases. It is shown that mediation simplifies, abstracts, reduces, merges, and explains data. A mediator is a software module that exploits encoded knowledge about certain sets or subsets of data to create information for a higher layer of applications. A model of information processing and information system components is described. The mediator architecture, including mediator interfaces, sharing of mediator modules, distribution of mediators, and triggers for knowledge maintenance, are discussed.<<ETX>>"

It would be impratical to build a single unified system that combines all of these information resources. A more promising approach is to build specialized information retrieval agents that provide access to a subset of the information resources and can send requests to other information retrieval agents when appropriate. In this paper we present the architecture of the individual information retrieval agents and describe how this architecture supports a network of cooperating information agents. We describe how these information agents represent their knowledge, communicate with other agents, dynamically construct information retrieval plans, and learn about other agents to improve efficiency. We have already built a small network of agents that have these capabilities and provide access to information for transportation planning.

As a second contribution, we describe novel query processing algorithms used to combine information from multiple sources. In particular, our algorithms are guaranteed to find exactly the set of information sources relevant to a query, and to completely exploit knowledge about local closed world information (Etzioni et al. 1994)."
