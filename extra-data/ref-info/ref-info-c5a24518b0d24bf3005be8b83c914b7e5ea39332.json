                "text": "THE DISCHARGES carried in the optic nerve fibers contain all the information which the central nervous system receives from the retina. A correct interpretation of discharge patterns therefore constitutes an important step in the analysis of visual events. Further, investigations of nervous activity arising in the eye reveal many aspects of the functional organization of the neural elements within the retina itself. Following studies of discharges in the optic nerve of the eel\u2019s eye by Adrian and Matthews (2,3), Hartline and his colleagues described the discharge pattern in the eye of the Limulus in a series of important and lucid papers (for a summary see 20). In the Limulus the relationship between the stimulus to the primary receptor cell and the nerve discharges proved relatively simple, apparently because the connection between sense cell and nerve fiber was a direct one. Thus, when stimulation is confined to one receptor the discharge in a single Limulus nerve fiber will provide a good indication of excitatory events which take place as a result of photochemical processes. Discharges last for the duration of illumination and their frequency is a measure of stimulus strength. Lately, however, it was shown by Hartline et al. (22) that inhibitory interactions may be revealed when several receptors are excited. On the whole, the Limulus preparation shows many features which are similar to other simple sense organs, for instance, stretch receptors. In the latter, however, instead of photochemical events, stretch-deformation acts as the adequate stimulus on sensory terminals and is translated into a characteristic discharge pattern. The discharge from the cold-blooded vertebrate retina (mainly frogs) proved much more complex. Hartline found three main types when recording from single optic nerve fibers: (i) \u201con\u201d discharges, similar to those in the Limulus, firing for the duration of the light stimulus, (ii) \u201coff\u201d discharges appearing when a light stimulus was withdrawn, and (iii) \u2018con-off\u201d discharges, a combination of the former two, with activity confined mainly to onset and cessation of illumination. The mammalian discharge patterns were studied in a number of species by Granit and his co-workers in the course of their extensive work on the physiology of the visual system (summaries in 13, 15). On the whole, they did not observe any fundamental differences between frog and mammalian discharge types (see later)."

                "text": "Nervous activity has been recorded from the unopened eye of decerebrate cats. Recordings were made with metal electrodes or with small micropipettes from ganglion cells or nerve fibers. Continuous maintained discharges were seen in all ganglion cells during steady illumination of their receptive fields, as well as in complete darkness. Possible artefacts, such as electrode pressure, abnormal circulation, anesthetic, and several other factors have been excluded as the source of the maintained discharge. Visual stimuli are therefore transmitted by modulating the ever present background activity. Discharge frequencies were measured following changes of retinal illumination. No consistent patterns of frequency change were found. The maintained discharge frequency may be permanently increased or decreased, or may remain practically unchanged by altering the steady level of illumination. In addition, there were often transient frequency changes during the first 5 to 10 minutes after changing illumination, before a final steady rate was established. A statistical analysis of the impulse intervals of the maintained discharge showed: (a) the intervals were distributed according to the gamma distribution (Pearson's type III), (b) the first serial correlation coefficient of the intervals was between \u20130.10 and \u20130.24, with a mean value of \u20130.17, which is significantly different from zero, (c) the higher order serial correlation coefficients were not significantly different from zero. Thus the firing probability at any time depends on the times of occurrence of the two preceding impulses only, and in such a way as to indicate that each impulse is followed by a transient depression of excitability that outlasts the following impulse. The possible sites at which spontaneous or maintained activity may originate in the retina are discussed."

Addam described in the Philosophical Magazine the faet, often before observed, that when, after looking at a sheet of falling water, the eyes were turned toward the adjacent bank, the latter with the rocks and trees upon it seemed for a short time to move slowly upward. This was explained by Addam and also by E. Javal by assuming that the eye followed the falling mass a moment, and then slipped back, and that this oscillation was associated with the impression of motion downward, but, by continuing after the eye had been turned upon a stationary object, caused us to attribute to the latter a movement in the opposite direction. This explanation is vague, was not favoured by the studies of nystagmus which it prompted, and has since been shown to be worthless, as we shall see later, by the fact that opposite motor aftereffects are possible for the same retina at the same time. Analogous observations were later made by Sir David Brewste r in the early days of railroad travelling'. When, e.g., after looking at objects from the window of a car we suddenly turn the eyes to the floor within, the latter seems to move away from our feet in the opposite direction. This apparent movement Helmholtz designates as dizziness (schwindel)', and explains it by saying that when the traveller tries to fixate the objects near the ttain outside, hia eye must be moved rapidly in a direction opposite the motion of the train. After he has become accustomed to regard the volitional impulses thus put forth as adapted to the fixation of objects, he tries, unconsciously believing his eyes to be motionless, to fixate objects at rest in the same way; thus objects on the train seem to move in the opposite sense although they are relatively at rest. If, Helmholtz continues, instead of looking out of the car, a point on the window-pane be fixated, this optical dizziness does not occur, because no motion is made by the eyeball for the fixation of"

Included are general analysis of signal detection, estimation, measurement, and related topics involving information transfer. Using the statistical Bayesian viewpoint, renowned author David Middleton employs statistical decision theory specifically tailored for the general tasks of signal processing. Dr. Middleton also provides a special focus on physical modeling of the canonical channel with real-world examples relating to radar, sonar, and general telecommunications. This book offers a detailed treatment and an array of problems and results spanning an exceptionally broad range of technical subjects in the communications field. Complete with special functions, integrals, solutions of integral equations, and an extensive, updated bibliography by chapter, An Introduction to Sta istical Communication Theory is a seminal reference, particularly for anyone working in the field of communications, as well as in other areas of statistical physics.

                "text": "The inhibition that is exerted mutually among receptor units (ommatidia) of the compound eye of Limulus is less for units widely separated than for those close together. This diminution of inhibition with distance is the resultant of two factors: (1) the threshold of inhibitory action increases with increasing distance between the units involved; and (2) the coefficient of inhibitory action decreases with increasing distance. The discharge of nerve impulses from ommatidia at various distances from one another may be described quantitatively by a set of simultaneous linear equations which express the excitatory effects of the illumination on each ommatidium and the inhibitory interactions between each ommatidium and its neighbors. The values of the thresholds and coefficients of inhibitory action, which appear as parameters in these equations, must be determined empirically: their dependence on distance is somewhat irregular and cannot yet be expressed in an exact general law. Nevertheless the diminution of inhibitory influences with distance is sufficiently uniform that patterns of neural response generated by various patterns of illumination on the receptor mosaic can be predicted qualitatively. Such predictions have been verified experimentally for two simple patterns of illumination: an abrupt step in intensity, and a simple gradient between two levels of intensity (the so-called Mach pattern). In each case, transitions in the pattern of illumination are accentuated in the corresponding pattern of neural response."
