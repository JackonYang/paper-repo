In this paper a new algorithm is introduced that attains efficiency by inferentially eliminating successor nodes in the tree search. To assess the time actually taken by the new algorithm, subgraph isomorphism, clique detection, graph isomorphism, and directed graph isomorphism experiments have been carried out with random and with various nonrandom graphs. A parallel asynchronous logic-in-memory implementation of a vital part of the algorithm is also described, although this hardware has not actually been built. The hardware implementation would allow very rapid determination of isomorphism."

We show that Latin square puzzles, finding N-ary relations, graph or auto-mata homomorphisms, graph colorings, as well as determining satisfiability of propositional logic statements and solving scene and edge labeling problems, are all special cases of the general consistent labeling problem. We then discuss the various approaches that researchers have used to speed up the tree search required to find consistent labelings. Each of these approaches uses a particular look-ahead operator to help eliminate backtracking in the tree search. Finally, we define the \u00bfKP two-parameter class of look-ahead operators which includes, as special cases, the operators other researchers have used."

Our approach to shape description is a formal model of a shape consisting of a set of primitives, their properties, and their interrelationships. The primitives are the simple parts and intrusions of the shape which can be derived through the graph-theoretic clustering procedure described in [31]. The interrelationships are two ternary relations on the primitives: the intrusion relation which relates two simple parts that join to the intrusion they surround and the protrusion relation which relates two intrusions to the protrusion between them. Using this model, a shape matching procedure that uses a tree search with look-ahead to find mappings from a prototype shape to a candidate shape has been developed. An experimental Snobol4 implementation has been used to test the program on hand-printed character data with favorable results."

An ordered-search algorithm is proposed for determining error-correcting isomorphisms.
