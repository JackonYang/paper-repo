Deep multi-layer neural networks have many levels of non-linearities allowing them to compactly represent highly non-linear and highly-varying functions. However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization appears to often get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently introduced a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning algorithm for Deep Belief Networks (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study this algorithm empirically and explore variants to better understand its success and extend it to cases where the inputs are continuous or where the structure of the input distribution is not revealing enough about the variable to be predicted in a supervised task. Our experiments also confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy mostly helps the optimization, by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, giving rise to internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input, bringing better generalization."

We argue that in order to progress toward this goal, the Machine Learning community must endeavor to discover algorithms that can learn highly complex functions, with minimal need for prior knowledge, and with minimal human intervention. We present mathematical and empirical evidence suggesting that many popular approaches to non-parametric learning, particularly kernel methods, are fundamentally limited in their ability to learn complex high-dimensional functions. Our analysis focuses on two problems. First, kernel machines are shallow architectures, in which one large layer of simple template matchers is followed by a single layer of trainable coefficients. We argue that shallow architectures can be very inefficient in terms of required number of computational elements and examples. Second, we analyze a limitation of kernel machines with a local kernel, linked to the curse of dimensionality, that applies to supervised, unsupervised (manifold learning) and semi-supervised kernel machines. Using empirical results on invariant image recognition tasks, kernel methods are compared with deep architectures, in which lower-level features or concepts are progressively combined into more abstract and higher-level representations.

However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization often appears to get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently proposed a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning procedure relying on the training algorithm of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) to initialize the parameters of a deep belief network (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. This was followed by the proposal of another greedy layer-wise procedure, relying on the usage of autoassociator networks. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study these algorithms empirically to better understand their success. Our experiments confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy helps the optimization by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, but also implicitly acts as a sort of regularization that brings better generalization and encourages internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input. We also present a series of experiments aimed at evaluating the link between the performance of deep neural networks and practical aspects of their topology, for example, demonstrating cases where the addition of more depth helps. Finally, we empirically explore simple variants of these training algorithms, such as the use of different RBM input unit distributions, a simple way of combining gradient estimators to improve performance, as well as on-line versions of those algorithms."

The building block of a DBN is a probabilistic model called a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), used to represent one layer of the model. Restricted Boltzmann machines are interesting because inference is easy in them and because they have been successfully used as building blocks for training deeper models. We first prove that adding hidden units yields strictly improved modeling power, while a second theorem shows that RBMs are universal approximators of discrete distributions. We then study the question of whether DBNs with more layers are strictly more powerful in terms of representational power. This suggests a new and less greedy criterion for training RBMs within DBNs."

Scaling such models to full-sized, high-dimensional images remains a difficult problem. To address this problem, we present the convolutional deep belief network, a hierarchical generative model which scales to realistic image sizes. This model is translation-invariant and supports efficient bottom-up and top-down probabilistic inference. Key to our approach is probabilistic max-pooling, a novel technique which shrinks the representations of higher layers in a probabilistically sound way. Our experiments show that the algorithm learns useful high-level visual features, such as object parts, from unlabeled images of objects and natural scenes. We demonstrate excellent performance on several visual recognition tasks and show that our model can perform hierarchical (bottom-up and top-down) inference over full-sized images."

Even though these new algorithms have enabled training deep models, many questions remain as to the nature of this di cult learning problem. Answering these questions is important if learning in deep architectures is to be further improved. We attempt to shed some light on these questions through extensive simulations. The experiments confirm and clarify the advantage of unsupervised pre-training. They demonstrate the robustness of the training procedure with respect to the random initialization, the positive e ect of pre-training in terms of optimization and its role as a regularizer. We empirically show the influence of pre-training with respect to architecture depth, model capacity, and number of training examples."

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind."

Efficient greedy algorithms for learning and approximate inference have allowed these models to be applied successfully in many application domains. The main building block of a DBN is a bipartite undirected graphical model called a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). Due to the presence of the partition function, model selection, complexity control, and exact maximum likelihood learning in RBM's are intractable. We show that Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) can be used to efficiently estimate the partition function of an RBM, and we present a novel AIS scheme for comparing RBM's with different architectures. We further show how an AIS estimator, along with approximate inference, can be used to estimate a lower bound on the log-probability that a DBN model with multiple hidden layers assigns to the test data. This is, to our knowledge, the first step towards obtaining quantitative results that would allow us to directly assess the performance of Deep Belief Networks as generative models of data."

Many unsupervised methods are based on reconstructing the input from the representation, while constraining the representation to have certain desirable properties (e.g. low dimension, sparsity, etc). Others are based on approximating density by stochastically reconstructing the input from the representation. We describe a novel and efficient algorithm to learn sparse representations, and compare it theoretically and experimentally with a similar machine trained probabilistically, namely a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. We propose a simple criterion to compare and select different unsupervised machines based on the trade-off between the reconstruction error and the information content of the representation. We demonstrate this method by extracting features from a dataset of handwritten numerals, and from a dataset of natural image patches. We show that by stacking multiple levels of such machines and by training sequentially, high-order dependencies between the input observed variables can be captured."

Data-dependent expectations are estimated using a variational approximation that tends to focus on a single mode, and dataindependent expectations are approximated using persistent Markov chains. The use of two quite different techniques for estimating the two types of expectation that enter into the gradient of the log-likelihood makes it practical to learn Boltzmann machines with multiple hidden layers and millions of parameters. The learning can be made more efficient by using a layer-by-layer \u201cpre-training\u201d phase that allows variational inference to be initialized with a single bottomup pass. We present results on the MNIST and NORB datasets showing that deep Boltzmann machines learn good generative models and perform well on handwritten digit and visual object recognition tasks."

Here, we formalize such training strategies in the context of machine learning, and call them \"curriculum learning\". In the context of recent research studying the difficulty of training in the presence of non-convex training criteria (for deep deterministic and stochastic neural networks), we explore curriculum learning in various set-ups. The experiments show that significant improvements in generalization can be achieved. We hypothesize that curriculum learning has both an effect on the speed of convergence of the training process to a minimum and, in the case of non-convex criteria, on the quality of the local minima obtained: curriculum learning can be seen as a particular form of continuation method (a general strategy for global optimization of non-convex functions)."

While several authors have formally or informally compared their algorithms to computations performed in visual area V1 (and the cochlea), little attempt has been made thus far to evaluate these algorithms in terms of their fidelity for mimicking computations at deeper levels in the cortical hierarchy. This paper presents an unsupervised learning model that faithfully mimics certain properties of visual area V2. Specifically, we develop a sparse variant of the deep belief networks of Hinton et al. (2006). We learn two layers of nodes in the network, and demonstrate that the first layer, similar to prior work on sparse coding and ICA, results in localized, oriented, edge filters, similar to the Gabor functions known to model V1 cell receptive fields. Further, the second layer in our model encodes correlations of the first layer responses in the data. Specifically, it picks up both colinear (\"contour\") features as well as corners and junctions. More interestingly, in a quantitative comparison, the encoding of these more complex \"corner\" features matches well with the results from the Ito & Komatsu's study of biological V2 responses. This suggests that our sparse variant of deep belief networks holds promise for modeling more higher-order features."

In contrast to the well-known backoff n-gram language models, the neural network approach tries to limit the data sparseness problem by performing the estimation in a continuous space, allowing by this means smooth interpolations. The complexity to train such a model and to calculate one n-gram probability is however several orders of magnitude higher than for the backoff models, making the new approach difficult to use in real applications. In this paper several techniques are presented that allow the use of a neural network language model in a large vocabulary speech recognition system, in particular very, fast lattice rescoring and efficient training of large neural networks on training corpora of over 10 million words. The described approach achieves significant word error reductions with respect to a carefully tuned 4-gram backoff language model in a state of the art conversational speech recognizer for the DARPA rich transcriptions evaluations."

In this paper a mechanism for {\\em automatically} learning or biasing the learner's hypothesis space is introduced. It works by first learning an appropriate {\\em internal representation} for a learning environment and then using that representation to bias the learner's hypothesis space for the learning of future tasks drawn from the same environment. \nAn internal representation must be learnt by sampling from {\\em many similar tasks}, not just a single task as occurs in ordinary machine learning. It is proved that the number of examples $m$ {\\em per task} required to ensure good generalisation from a representation learner obeys $m = O(a+b/n)$ where $n$ is the number of tasks being learnt and $a$ and $b$ are constants. If the tasks are learnt independently ({\\em i.e.} without a common representation) then $m=O(a+b)$. It is argued that for learning environments such as speech and character recognition $b\\gg a$ and hence representation learning in these environments can potentially yield a drastic reduction in the number of examples required per task. It is also proved that if $n = O(b)$ (with $m=O(a+b/n)$) then the representation learnt will be good for learning novel tasks from the same environment, and that the number of examples required to generalise well on a novel task will be reduced to $O(a)$ (as opposed to $O(a+b)$ if no representation is used). \nIt is shown that gradient descent can be used to train neural network representations and experiment results are reported providing strong qualitative support for the theoretical results."

The main drawback of NPLMs is their extremely long training and testing times. Morin and Bengio have proposed a hierarchical language model built around a binary tree of words, which was two orders of magnitude faster than the non-hierarchical model it was based on. However, it performed considerably worse than its non-hierarchical counterpart in spite of using a word tree created using expert knowledge. We introduce a fast hierarchical language model along with a simple feature-based algorithm for automatic construction of word trees from the data. We then show that the resulting models can outperform non-hierarchical neural models as well as the best n-gram models."

                "text": "Recently, many applications for Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) have been developed for a large variety of learning problems. However, RBMs are usually used as feature extractors for another learning algorithm or to provide a good initialization for deep feed-forward neural network classifiers, and are not considered as a standalone solution to classification problems. In this paper, we argue that RBMs provide a self-contained framework for deriving competitive non-linear classifiers. We present an evaluation of different learning algorithms for RBMs which aim at introducing a discriminative component to RBM training and improve their performance as classifiers. This approach is simple in that RBMs are used directly to build a classifier, rather than as a stepping stone. Finally, we demonstrate how discriminative RBMs can also be successfully employed in a semi-supervised setting."

While feature-learning machines in the form of hierarchial feed-forward models (e.g., convolutional neural networks) showed promise in this direction, they are still difficult to train especially when few training examples are available. In this paper, we present a framework for training hierarchical feed-forward models for visual recognition, using transfer learning from pseudo tasks. These pseudo tasks are automatically constructed from data without supervision and comprise a set of simple pattern-matching operations. We show that these pseudo tasks induce an informative inverse-Wishart prior on the functional behavior of the network, offering an effective way to incorporate useful prior knowledge into the network training. In addition to being extremely simple to implement, and adaptable across different domains with little or no extra tuning, our approach achieves promising results on challenging visual recognition tasks, including object recognition, gender recognition, and ethnicity recognition."

Performance at both regression and classification can then be further improved by using backpropagation through the DBN to discriminatively fine-tune the covariance kernel."

One fruitful approach is to build a parameterized stochastic generative model, independent draws from which are likely to produce the patterns. For all but the simplest generative models, each pattern can be generated in exponentially many ways. It is thus intractable to adjust the parameters to maximize the probability of the observed patterns. We describe a way of finessing this combinatorial explosion by maximizing an easily computed lower bound on the probability of the observations. Our method can be viewed as a form of hierarchical self-supervised learning that may relate to the function of bottom-up and top-down cortical processing pathways."

This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts."

The generative models can be learned one layer at a time and when learning is complete they have a very fast inference procedure for computing a good approximation to the posterior distribution in all of the hidden layers. Each hidden layer has its own MRF whose energy function is modulated by the top-down directed connections from the layer above. To generate from the model, each layer in turn must settle to equilibrium given its top-down input. We show that this type of model is good at capturing the statistics of patches of natural images."

The multiple tasks are themselves generated by sampling from a distribution over an environment of related tasks. Such an environment is shown to be naturally modelled within a Bayesian context by the concept of an objective prior distribution. It is argued that for many common machine learning problems, although in general we do not know the true (objective) prior for the problem, we do have some idea of a set of possible priors to which the true prior belongs. It is shown that under these circumstances a learner can use Bayesian inference to learn the true prior by learning sufficiently many tasks from the environment. In addition, bounds are given on the amount of information required to learn a task when it is simultaneously learnt with several other tasks. The bounds show that if the learner has little knowledge of the true prior, but the dimensionality of the true prior is small, then sampling multiple tasks is highly advantageous. The theory is applied to the problem of learning a common feature set or equivalently a low-dimensional-representation (LDR) for an environment of related tasks."

We introduce and motivate a new training principle for unsupervised learning of a representation based on the idea of making the learned representations robust to partial corruption of the input pattern. This approach can be used to train autoencoders, and these denoising autoencoders can be stacked to initialize deep architectures. The algorithm can be motivated from a manifold learning and information theoretic perspective or from a generative model perspective. Comparative experiments clearly show the surprising advantage of corrupting the input of autoencoders on a pattern classification benchmark suite."

Although trai ning error can be reduced either by exploiting only the top layers ability to fit the training examples, bett er generalization is achieved when all the layers are tuned appropriately. Another source of better generalizat ion could come from a form of regularization: with unsupervised pre-training, the lower layers are constrain ed to capture regularities of the input distribution. Consider random input-output pairs (X,Y ). Such regularization is similar to the hypothesized effec t of unlabeled examples in semi-supervised learning (Lasserre , Bishop, & Minka, 2006) or the regularization effect achieved by maximizing the likelihood of P (X,Y ) (generative models) vs P (Y |X) (discriminant models) (Ng & Jordan, 2002; Liang & Jordan, 2008). If the true P (X) andP (Y |X) are unrelated as functions ofX (e.g., chosen independently, so that learning about one doe s not inform us of the other), then unsupervised learning of P (X) is not going to help learning P (Y |X). But if they are related6, and if the same parameters are involved in estimating P (X) andP (Y |X)7, then each(X,Y ) pair brings information on P (Y |X) not only in the usual way but also through P (X). For example, in a Deep Belief Net, both distributions share essentially the same parameters, so th e parameters involved in estimating P (Y |X) benefit from a form of data-dependent regularization: they have to a gree to some extent with P (Y |X) as well as with P (X). Let us return to the optimization versus regularization exp lanation of the better results obtained with unsupervised pre-training. Note how one should be careful w hen using the word \u2019optimization\u2019 here. We do not have an optimization difficulty in the usual sense of th e word. Indeed, from the point of view of the whole network, there is no difficulty since one can drive t raining error very low, by relying mostly on the top two layers. However, if one considers the problem o f tuning the lower layers (while keeping small either the number of hidden units of the penultimate la y r (i.e. top hidden layer) or the magnitude of the weights of the top two layers), then one can maybe talk abo ut an optimization difficulty. One way to reconcile the optimization and regularization viewpoints might be to consider the truly online setting (where examples come from an infinite stream and one does not cycle ba k through a training set). In that case, online gradient descent is performing a stochastic optimiz ation of the generalization error. If the effect of unsupervised pre-training was purely one of regularizatio n, one would expect that with a virtually infinite training set, online error with or without pre-training wou ld converge to the same level. On the other hand, if the explanatory hypothesis presented here is correct, we wo uld expect that unsupervised pre-training would bring clear benefits even in the online setting. To explore th at question, we have used the \u2019infinite MNIST\u2019 dataset (Loosli, Canu, & Bottou, 2007) i.e. a virtually infin ite stream of MNIST-like digit images (obtained by random translations, rotations, scaling, etc. defined in Simard, LeCun, and Denker (1993))."

We argue that, in general, deep architectures can compactly represent highly-varying fun ctio s which would otherwise require a very large size to be represented with an inappropriate architecture. W say that a function ishighly-varyingwhen a piecewise approximation (e.g., piecewise-constant or pi ecewise-linear) of that function would require a large number of pieces. A deep architecture is a composition of many operations, and it could in any case be represented by a possibly very large depth-2 architectur . The composition of computational units in a small but deep circuit can actually be seen as an efficient \u201cf ac orization\u201d of a large but shallow circuit. Reorganizing the way in which computational units are compo sed can have a drastic effect on the efficiency of representation size. For example, imagine a depth 2k representation of polynomials where odd layers implement products and even layers implement sums. This arc hitecture can be seen as a particularly efficient factorization, which when expanded into a depth 2 architect ur such as a sum of products, might require a huge number of terms in the sum: consider a level 1 product (li ke x2x3 in Figure 3) from the depth2k architecture. It could occur many times as a factor in many te rms of the depth 2 architecture. One can see in this example that deep architectures can be advantageous if some computations (e.g. at one level) can be shared (when considering the expanded depth 2 expression ): in that case, the overall expression to be represented can be factored out, i.e., represented more com pa tly with a deep architecture. Further examples suggesting greater expressive power of de ep architectures and their potential for AI and machine learning are also discussed by Bengio and LeCun ( 2007). An earlier discussion of the expected advantages of deeper architectures in a more cogniti ve perspective is found in Utgoff and Stracuzzi (2002).

A single-hidden-layer neural network of this kind of model achieves 1.50% error on MNIST. We also introduce an existing criterion for learning slow, decorrelated features as a pretraining strategy for image models. This pretraining strategy results in orientation-selective features, similar to the receptive fields of complex cells. With this pretraining, the same single-hidden-layer model achieves 1.34% error, even though the pretraining sample distribution is very different from the fine-tuning distribution. To implement this pretraining strategy, we derive a fast algorithm for online learning of decorrelated features such that each iteration of the algorithm runs in linear time with respect to the number of features."

The modules communicate using these representations, which are global and publicly available in the system. The representations are developed automatically by all networks while they are learning their processing tasks. The resulting representations reflect the regularities in the subtasks, which facilitates robust processing in the face of noise and damage, supports improved generalization, and provides expectations about possible contexts. The lexicon can be extended by cloning new instances of the items, that is, by generating a number of items with known processing properties and distinct identities. This technique combinatorially increases the processing power of the system. The recurrent FGREP module, together with a central lexicon, is used as a basic building block in modeling higher level natural language tasks. A single module is used to form case-role representations of sentences from word-by-word sequential natural language input. A hierarchical organization of four recurrent FGREP modules (the DISPAR system) is trained to produce fully expanded paraphrases of script-based stories, where unmentioned events and role fillers are inferred."

We present a new model, based on the CRBM that preserves its most important computational properties and includes multiplicative three-way interactions that allow the effective interaction weight between two units to be modulated by the dynamic state of a third unit. We factor the three-way weight tensor implied by the multiplicative model, reducing the number of parameters from O(N3) to O(N2). The result is an efficient, compact model whose effectiveness we demonstrate by modeling human motion. Like the CRBM, our model can capture diverse styles of motion with a single set of parameters, and the three-way interactions greatly improve the model's ability to blend motion styles or to transition smoothly among them."

Insight into the nature of these complex Bayesian models is provided by a theoretical investigation of the priors over functions that underlie them. A practical implementation of Bayesian neural network learning using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is also described, and software for it is freely available over the Internet. Presupposing only basic knowledge of probability and statistics, this book should be of interest to researchers in statistics, engineering, and artificial intelligence."

In the standard depiction of the network's state space, memories of objects are stored as attractive fixed points of the dynamics. I argue for a modification of this picture: if an object has a continuous family of instantiations, it should be represented by a continuous attractor. This idea is illustrated with a network that learns to complete patterns. To perform the task of filling in missing information, the network develops a continuous attractor that models the manifold from which the patterns are drawn. From a statistical view-point, the pattern completion task allows a formulation of unsupervised learning in terms of regression rather than density estimation."

On the other hand, discriminative methods such as support vector machines enable us to construct flexible decision boundaries and often result in classification performance superior to that of the model based approaches. An ideal classifier should combine these two complementary approaches. In this paper, we develop a natural way of achieving this combination by deriving kernel functions for use in discriminative methods such as support vector machines from generative probability models. We provide a theoretical justification for this combination as well as demonstrate a substantial improvement in the classification performance in the context of DNA and protein sequence analysis."

Our discussion covers supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. These algorithms are found to be local in the sense that crucial properties of the learned function at x depend mostly on the neighbors of x in the training set. This makes them sensitive to the curse of dimensionality, well studied for classical non-parametric statistical learning. We show in the case of the Gaussian kernel that when the function to be learned has many variations, these algorithms require a number of training examples proportional to the number of variations, which could be large even though there may exist short descriptions of the target function, i.e. their Kolmogorov complexity may be low. This suggests that there exist non-local learning algorithms that at least have the potential to learn about such structured but apparently complex functions (because locally they have many variations), while not using very specific prior domain knowledge."

This way of combining individual expert models makes it hard to generate samples from the combined model but easy to infer the values of the latent variables of each expert, because the combination rule ensures that the latent variables of different experts are conditionally independent when given the data. A product of experts (PoE) is therefore an interesting candidate for a perceptual system in which rapid inference is vital and generation is unnecessary. Training a PoE by maximizing the likelihood of the data is difficult because it is hard even to approximate the derivatives of the renormalization term in the combination rule. Fortunately, a PoE can be trained using a different objective function called contrastive divergence whose derivatives with regard to the parameters can be approximated accurately and efficiently. Examples are presented of contrastive divergence learning using several types of expert on several types of data."

Inference consists in clamping the value of observed variables and finding config urations of the remaining variables that minimize the energy. Learning consists in finding an energy function in which observed configurations of the variables a re given lower energies than unobserved ones. The EBM approach provides a common theoretical framework for many learning models, including traditional discr iminative and generative approaches, as well as graph-transformer networks, co nditional random fields, maximum margin Markov networks, and several manifold learning methods. Probabilistic models must be properly normalized, which sometimes requires evaluating intractable integrals over the space of all poss ible variable configurations. Since EBMs have no requirement for proper normalization, this problem is naturally circumvented. EBMs can be viewed as a form of non-probabilistic factor graphs, and they provide considerably more flexibility in th e design of architectures and training criteria than probabilistic approaches ."

The model can be represented by a particular type of Boltzmann machine with a bipartite graph structure that we call the combination machine. This machine is closely related to the Harmonium model defined by Smolensky. In the first part of the paper we analyze properties of this distribution representation scheme. We show that arbitrary distributions of binary vectors can be approximated by the combination model. We show how the weight vectors in the model can be interpreted as high order correlation patterns among the input bits, and how the combination machine can be used as a mechanism for detecting these patterns. We compare the combination model with the mixture model and with principle component analysis. In the second part of the paper we present two algorithms for learning the combination model from examples. The first learning algorithm is the standard gradient ascent heuristic for computing maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters of the model. Here we give a closed form for this gradient that is significantly easier to compute than the corresponding gradient for the general Boltzmann machine. The second learning algorithm is a greedy method that creates the hidden units and computes their weights one at a time. This method is a variant of projection pursuit density estimation. In the third part of the paper we give experimental results for these learning methods on synthetic data and on natural data of handwritten digit images."

The connectionist models use a distributed representation of the items in the history and make much better use of contexts than currently used interpolated or back-off models, not only because of the inherent capability of the connectionist model in fighting the data sparseness problem, but also because of the sublinear growth in the model size when the context length is increased. The connectionist models can be further trained by an EM procedure, similar to the previously used procedure for training the SLM. Our experiments show that the connectionist models can significantly improve the PPL over the interpolated and back-off models on the UPENN Treebank corpora, after interpolating with a baseline trigram language model. The EM training procedure can improve the connectionist models further, by using hidden events obtained by the SLM parser."

Tieleman (2008) showed that better learning can be achieved by estimating the model's statistics using a small set of persistent \"fantasy particles\" that are not reinitialized to data points after each weight update. With sufficiently small weight updates, the fantasy particles represent the equilibrium distribution accurately but to explain why the method works with much larger weight updates it is necessary to consider the interaction between the weight updates and the Markov chain. We show that the weight updates force the Markov chain to mix fast, and using this insight we develop an even faster mixing chain that uses an auxiliary set of \"fast weights\" to implement a temporary overlay on the energy landscape. The fast weights learn rapidly but also decay rapidly and do not contribute to the normal energy landscape that defines the model."

                "text": "Maximum-likelihood (ML) learning of Markov random fields is challenging because it requires estimates of averages that have an exponential number of terms. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods typically take a long time to converge on unbiased estimates, but Hinton (2002) showed that if the Markov chain is only run for a few steps, the learning can still work well and it approximately minimizes a different function called \u201ccontrastive divergence\u201d (CD). CD learning has been successfully applied to various types of random fields. Here, we study the properties of CD learning and show that it provides biased estimates in general, but that the bias is typically very small. Fast CD learning can therefore be used to get close to an ML solution and slow ML learning can then be used to fine-tune the CD solution. Consider a probability distribution over a vector x (assumed discrete w.l.o.g.) and with parameters W p(x;W) = 1 Z(W) e (1) where Z(W) = \u2211 x e \u2212E(x;W) is a normalisation constant and E(x;W) is an energy function. This class of random-field distributions has found many practical applications (Li, 2001; Winkler, 2002; Teh et al., 2003; He et al., 2004). Maximum-likelihood (ML) learning of the parameters W given an iid sample X = {xn}n=1 can be done by gradient ascent: W = W + \u03b7 \u2202L(W;X ) \u2202W \u2223"

The basic model is defined as a gated conditional random field that is trained to predict transformations of its inputs using a factorial set of latent variables. Inference in the model consists in extracting the transformation, given a pair of images, and can be performed exactly and efficiently. We show that, when trained on natural videos, the model develops domain specific motion features, in the form of fields of locally transformed edge filters. When trained on affine, or more general, transformations of still images, the model develops codes for these transformations, and can subsequently perform recognition tasks that are invariant under these transformations. It can also fantasize new transformations on previously unseen images. We describe several variations of the basic model and provide experimental results that demonstrate its applicability to a variety of tasks."

We propose a sequential approach to adding features to a random field model by training them to improve classification performance between the data and an equal-sized sample of \"negative examples\" generated from the model's current estimate of the data density. Training in each boosting round proceeds in three stages: first we sample negative examples from the model's current Boltzmann distribution. Next, a feature is trained to improve classification performance between data and negative examples. Finally, a coefficient is learned which determines the importance of this feature relative to ones already in the pool. Negative examples only need to be generated once to learn each new feature. The validity of the approach is demonstrated on binary digits and continuous synthetic data."

In contrast to the causal generative extensions of ICA which maintain marginal independence of sources, we define features as deterministic (linear) functions of the inputs. This assumption results in marginal dependencies among the features, but conditional independence of the features given the inputs. By assigning energies to the features a probability distribution over the input states is defined through the Boltzmann distribution. Free parameters of this model are trained using the contrastive divergence objective (Hinton, 2002). When the number of features is equal to the number of input dimensions this energy-based model reduces to noiseless ICA and we show experimentally that the proposed learning algorithm is able to perform blind source separation on speech data. In additional experiments we train overcomplete energy-based models to extract features from various standard data-sets containing speech, natural images, hand-written digits and faces."

The model has a hierarchy of two layers, with the first layer broadly corresponding to Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and a second layer to represent higher order structure. We estimate the model using the mathematical framework of Score Matching (SM), a novel method for the estimation of non-normalized statistical models. The model incorporates a squaring nonlinearity, which we propose to be suitable for forming a higher-order code of invariances. Additionally the squaring can be viewed as modelling subspaces to capture residual dependencies, which linear models cannot capture."

We propose three new probabilistic language models that define the distribution of the next word in a sequence given several preceding words by using distributed representations of those words. We show how real-valued distributed representations for words can be learned at the same time as learning a large set of stochastic binary hidden features that are used to predict the distributed representation of the next word from previous distributed representations. Adding connections from the previous states of the binary hidden features improves performance as does adding direct connections between the real-valued distributed representations. One of our models significantly outperforms the very best n-gram models."

                "text": "When labelled training data is plentiful, discriminative techniques are widely used since they give excellent generalization performance. However, for large-scale applications such as object recognition, hand labelling of data is expensive, and there is much interest in semi-supervised techniques based on generative models in which the majority of the training data is unlabelled. Although the generalization performance of generative models can often be improved by \u2018training them discriminatively\u2019, they can then no longer make use of unlabelled data. In an attempt to gain the benefit of both generative and discriminative approaches, heuristic procedure have been proposed [2, 3] which interpolate between these two extremes by taking a convex combination of the generative and discriminative objective functions. In this paper we adopt a new perspective which says that there is only one correct way to train a given model, and that a \u2018discriminatively trained\u2019 generative model is fundamentally a new model [7]. From this viewpoint, generative and discriminative models correspond to specific choices for the prior over parameters. As well as giving a principled interpretation of \u2018discriminative training\u2019, this approach opens door to very general ways of interpolating between generative and discriminative extremes through alternative choices of prior. We illustrate this framework using both synthetic data and a practical example in the domain of multi-class object recognition. Our results show that, when the supply of labelled training data is limited, the optimum performance corresponds to a balance between the purely generative and the purely discriminative."

In Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the key ideas and algorithms of reinforcement learning. Their discussion ranges from the history of the field's intellectual foundations to the most recent developments and applications. The only necessary mathematical background is familiarity with elementary concepts of probability. The book is divided into three parts. Part I defines the reinforcement learning problem in terms of Markov decision processes. Part II provides basic solution methods: dynamic programming, Monte Carlo methods, and temporal-difference learning. Part III presents a unified view of the solution methods and incorporates artificial neural networks, eligibility traces, and planning; the two final chapters present case studies and consider the future of reinforcement learning."

In this context, machine learning algorithms that scale poorly could simply become irrelevant. We need learning algorithms that scale linearly with the volume of the data while maintaining enough statistical efficiency to outperform algorithms that simply process a random subset of the data. This volume offers researchers and engineers practical solutions for learning from large scale datasets, with detailed descriptions of algorithms and experiments carried out on realistically large datasets. At the same time it offers researchers information that can address the relative lack of theoretical grounding for many useful algorithms. After a detailed description of state-of-the-art support vector machine technology, an introduction of the essential concepts discussed in the volume, and a comparison of primal and dual optimization techniques, the book progresses from well-understood techniques to more novel and controversial approaches. Many contributors have made their code and data available online for further experimentation. Topics covered include fast implementations of known algorithms, approximations that are amenable to theoretical guarantees, and algorithms that perform well in practice but are difficult to analyze theoretically.ContributorsLeon Bottou, Yoshua Bengio, Stephane Canu, Eric Cosatto, Olivier Chapelle, Ronan Collobert, Dennis DeCoste, Ramani Duraiswami, Igor Durdanovic, Hans-Peter Graf, Arthur Gretton, Patrick Haffner, Stefanie Jegelka, Stephan Kanthak, S.

The machine conceptually implements the following idea: input vectors are non-linearly mapped to a very high-dimension feature space. In this feature space a linear decision surface is constructed. Special properties of the decision surface ensures high generalization ability of the learning machine. The idea behind the support-vector network was previously implemented for the restricted case where the training data can be separated without errors. We here extend this result to non-separable training data.High generalization ability of support-vector networks utilizing polynomial input transformations is demonstrated. We also compare the performance of the support-vector network to various classical learning algorithms that all took part in a benchmark study of Optical Character Recognition."

This paper follows up on proposed non-parametric algorithms which provide an estimated continuous label for the given unlabeled examples. It extends them to function induction algorithms that correspond to the minimization of a regularization criterion applied to an out-of-sample example, and happens to have the form of a Parzen windows regressor. The advantage of the extension is that it allows predicting the label for a new example without having to solve again a linear system of dimension 'n' (the number of unlabeled and labeled training examples), which can cost O(n^3). Experiments show that the extension works well, in the sense of predicting a label close to the one that would have been obtained if the test example had been included in the unlabeled set. This relatively efficient function induction procedure can also be used when 'n' is large to approximate the solution by writing it only in terms of a kernel expansion with 'm' Keywords: non-parametric models, classification, regression, semi-supervised learning, modeles non parametriques, classification, regression, apprentissage semi-supervise"

This representation neither captures dependencies between related words, nor handles synonyms or polysemous words. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to learn text document representations based on semi-supervised autoencoders that are stacked to form a deep network. The model can be trained efficiently on partially labeled corpora, producing very compact representations of documents, while retaining as much class information and joint word statistics as possible. We show that it is advantageous to exploit even a few labeled samples during training."

                "text": "Sparse coding is an unsupervised learning algorithm that learns a succinct high-level representation of the inputs given only unlabeled data; it represents each input as a sparse linear combination of a set of basis functions. Originally applied to modeling the human visual cortex, sparse coding has also been shown to be useful for self-taught learning, in which the goal is to solve a supervised classification task given access to additional unlabeled data drawn from different classes than that in the supervised learning problem. Shift-invariant sparse coding (SISC) is an extension of sparse coding which reconstructs a (usually time-series) input using all of the basis functions in all possible shifts. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for learning SISC bases. Our method is based on iteratively solving two large convex optimization problems: The first, which computes the linear coefficients, is an L1-regularized linear least squares problem with potentially hundreds of thousands of variables. Existing methods typically use a heuristic to select a small subset of the variables to optimize, but we present a way to efficiently compute the exact solution. The second, which solves for bases, is a constrained linear least squares problem. By optimizing over complex-valued variables in the Fourier domain, we reduce the coupling between the different variables, allowing the problem to be solved efficiently. We show that SISC's learned high-level representations of speech and music provide useful features for classification tasks within those domains. When applied to classification, under certain conditions the learned features outperform state of the art spectral and cepstral features."

However, finding sparse codes remains a very difficult computational problem. In this paper, we present efficient sparse coding algorithms that are based on iteratively solving two convex optimization problems: an L1-regularized least squares problem and an L2-constrained least squares problem. We propose novel algorithms to solve both of these optimization problems. Our algorithms result in a significant speedup for sparse coding, allowing us to learn larger sparse codes than possible with previously described algorithms. We apply these algorithms to natural images and demonstrate that the inferred sparse codes exhibit end-stopping and non-classical receptive field surround suppression and, therefore, may provide a partial explanation for these two phenomena in V1 neurons."

One can qualitatively understand the difference between mixtures and products by observing that a mixture distribution can have high probability for event x when only a single expert assigns high probability to that event. In contrast, a product can only have high probability for an event x when all experts assign high probability to that event. Hence, metaphorically speaking, a single expert in a mixture has the power to pass a bill while a single expert in a product has the power to veto it. Put another way, each component in a product represents a soft constraint , while each expert in a mixture represents a soft template or prototype.

We show how smoother priors can preserve the benefits of these sparse priors while adding stability to the Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) estimate that makes it more useful for prediction problems. Additionally, we show how to calculate the derivative of the MAP estimate efficiently with implicit differentiation. One prior that can be differentiated this way is KL-regularization. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a wide variety of applications, and find that online optimization of the parameters of the KL-regularized model can significantly improve prediction performance."

Overcomplete representations have been advocated because they have greater robustness in the presence of noise, can be sparser, and can have greater flexibility in matching structure in the data. Overcomplete codes have also been proposed as a model of some of the response properties of neurons in primary visual cortex. Previous work has focused on finding the best representation of a signal using a fixed overcomplete basis (or dictionary). We present an algorithm for learning an overcomplete basis by viewing it as probabilistic model of the observed data. We show that overcomplete bases can yield a better approximation of the underlying statistical distribution of the data and can thus lead to greater coding efficiency. This can be viewed as a generalization of the technique of independent component analysis and provides a method for Bayesian reconstruction of signals in the presence of noise and for blind source separation when there are more sources than mixtures."

We first study ways to control the capacity of Perceptrons (mainly regularization parameters and early stopping), using the margin idea introduced with SVMs. After showing that under simple conditions a Perceptron is equivalent to an SVM, we show it can be computationally expensive in time to train an SVM (and thus a Perceptron) with stochastic gradient descent, mainly because of the margin maximization term in the cost function. We then show that if we remove this margin maximization term, the learning rate or the use of early stopping can still control the margin. These ideas are extended afterward to the case of MLPs. Moreover, under some assumptions it also appears that MLPs are a kind of mixture of SVMs, maximizing the margin in the hidden layer space. Finally, we present a very simple MLP based on the previous findings, which yields better performances in generalization and speed than the other models."

In this framework, an energy function associates low energies to input points that are similar to training samples, and high energies to unobserved points. Learning consists in minimizing the energies of training samples while ensuring that the energies of unobserved ones are higher. Some traditional methods construct the architecture so that only a small number of points can have low energy, while other methods explicitly \u201cpull up\u201d on the energies of unobserved points. In probabilistic methods the energy of unobserved points is pulled by minimizing the log partition function, an expensive, and sometimes intractable process. We explore different and more efficient methods using an energy-based approach. In particular, we show that a simple solution is to restrict the amount of information contained in codes that represent the data. We demonstrate such a method by training it on natural image patches and by applying to image denoising."

This paper describes a set of concrete bestpractices that document analysis researchers can use toget good results with neural networks. The mostimportant practice is getting a training set as large aspossible: we expand the training set by adding a newform of distorted data. The next most important practiceis that convolutional neural networks are better suited forvisual document tasks than fully connected networks. Wepropose that a simple \"do-it-yourself\" implementation ofconvolution with a flexible architecture is suitable formany visual document problems. This simpleconvolutional neural network does not require complexmethods, such as momentum, weight decay, structure-dependentlearning rates, averaging layers, tangent prop,or even finely-tuning the architecture. The end result is avery simple yet general architecture which can yieldstate-of-the-art performance for document analysis. Weillustrate our claims on the MNIST set of English digitimages."

Although this approach has met with considerable success, the causal semantics of these models can make it difficult to infer the posterior distribution over the hidden variables. In this paper we propose an alternative two-layer model based on exponential family distributions and the semantics of undirected models. Inference in these \"exponential family harmoniums\" is fast while learning is performed by minimizing contrastive divergence. A member of this family is then studied as an alternative probabilistic model for latent semantic indexing. In experiments it is shown that they perform well on document retrieval tasks and provide an elegant solution to searching with keywords."

The model uses a linear encoder, and a linear decoder preceded by a sparsifying non-linearity that turns a code vector into a quasi-binary sparse code vector. Given an input, the optimal code minimizes the distance between the output of the decoder and the input patch while being as similar as possible to the encoder output. Learning proceeds in a two-phase EM-like fashion: (1) compute the minimum-energy code vector, (2) adjust the parameters of the encoder and decoder so as to decrease the energy. The model produces \"stroke detectors\" when trained on handwritten numerals, and Gabor-like filters when trained on natural image patches. Inference and learning are very fast, requiring no preprocessing, and no expensive sampling. Using the proposed unsupervised method to initialize the first layer of a convolutional network, we achieved an error rate slightly lower than the best reported result on the MNIST dataset. Finally, an extension of the method is described to learn topographical filter maps."

This observation invites an exploration of nonlocal manifold learning algorithms that attempt to discover shared structure in the tangent planes at different positions. A training criterion for such an algorithm is proposed, and experiments estimating a tangent plane prediction function are presented, showing its advantages with respect to local manifold learning algorithms: it is able to generalize very far from training data (on learning handwritten character image rotations), where local nonparametric methods fail."

Progress in face recognition relies critically on the creationof test sets against which the performance of various approaches can beevaluated. A good set must capture the essential elements of what makesthe problem hard, while conforming to practical scale limitations. How-ever, these goals are often deceptively di\u000ecult to achieve. In the relatedarea of object recognition, Pinto et al. [2] demonstrated the potentialdangers of using a large, uncontrolled natural image set, showing thatan extremely rudimentary vision system (inspired by the early stages ofvisual processing in the brain) was able to perform on par with manystate-of-the-art vision systems on the popular Caltech101 object set [3].At the same time, this same rudimentary system was easily defeatedby an ostensibly \\simpler\" synthetic recognition test designed to betterspan the range of real world variation in object pose, position, scale, etc.These results suggested that image sets that look \\natural\" to human ob-servers may nonetheless fail to properly embody the problem of interest,and that care must be taken to establish baselines against which perfor-mance can be judged. Here, we repeat this approach for the \\LabeledFaces in the Wild\" (LFW) dataset [1], and for a collection of standardface recognition tests. The goal of the present work is not to competein the LFW challenge, per se, but to provide a baseline against whichthe performance of other systems can be judged. In particular, we foundthat our rudimentary \\baseline\" vision system was able to achieve \u0018 68%correct performance on the LFW challenge, substantially higher than apure \\chance\" baseline. We argue that this value might serve as a moreuseful baseline against which to evaluate absolute performance and arguethat the LFW set, while perhaps not perfect, represents an improvementover other standard face sets."

The resulting feature extractor consists of multiple convolution filters, followed by a feature-pooling layer that computes the max of each filter output within adjacent windows, and a point-wise sigmoid non-linearity. A second level of larger and more invariant features is obtained by training the same algorithm on patches of features from the first level. Training a supervised classifier on these features yields 0.64% error on MNIST, and 54% average recognition rate on Caltech 101 with 30 training samples per category. While the resulting architecture is similar to convolutional networks, the layer-wise unsupervised training procedure alleviates the over-parameterization problems that plague purely supervised learning procedures, and yields good performance with very few labeled training samples."

We also introduced the related notion of a \"pseudo-loss\" which is a method for forcing a learning algorithm of multi-label concepts to concentrate on the labels that are hardest to discriminate. In this paper, we describe experiments we carried out to assess how well AdaBoost with and without pseudo-loss, performs on real learning problems. We performed two sets of experiments. The first set compared boosting to Breiman's \"bagging\" method when used to aggregate various classifiers (including decision trees and single attribute- value tests). We compared the performance of the two methods on a collection of machine-learning benchmarks. In the second set of experiments, we studied in more detail the performance of boosting using a nearest-neighbor classifier on an OCR problem."

We are particularly interested in estimators of the gradient of the log likelihood obtained through this expansion. We show that its residual term converges to zero, justifying the use of a truncationrunning only a short Gibbs chain, which is the main idea behind the contrastive divergence (CD) estimator of the log-likelihood gradient. By truncating even more, we obtain a stochastic reconstruction error, related through a mean-field approximation to the reconstruction error often used to train autoassociators and stacked autoassociators. The derivation is not specific to the particular parametric forms used in RBMs and requires only convergence of the Gibbs chain. We present theoretical and empirical evidence linking the number of Gibbs steps k and the magnitude of the RBM parameters to the bias in the CD estimator. These experiments also suggest that the sign of the CD estimator is correct most of the time, even when the bias is large, so that CD-k is a good descent direction even for small k."

We do not assume that the unlabeled data follows the same class labels or generative distribution as the labeled data. Thus, we would like to use a large number of unlabeled images (or audio samples, or text documents) randomly downloaded from the Internet to improve performance on a given image (or audio, or text) classification task. Such unlabeled data is significantly easier to obtain than in typical semi-supervised or transfer learning settings, making self-taught learning widely applicable to many practical learning problems. We describe an approach to self-taught learning that uses sparse coding to construct higher-level features using the unlabeled data. These features form a succinct input representation and significantly improve classification performance. When using an SVM for classification, we further show how a Fisher kernel can be learned for this representation."

It then uses a set of generative weights to convert the code vector into an approximate reconstruction of the input vector. We derive an objective function for training autoencoders based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. The aim is to minimize the information required to describe both the code vector and the reconstruction error. We show that this information is minimized by choosing code vectors stochastically according to a Boltzmann distribution, where the generative weights define the energy of each possible code vector given the input vector. Unfortunately, if the code vectors use distributed representations, it is exponentially expensive to compute this Boltzmann distribution because it involves all possible code vectors. We show that the recognition weights of an autoencoder can be used to compute an approximation to the Boltzmann distribution and that this approximation gives an upper bound on the description length. Even when this bound is poor, it can be used as a Lyapunov function for learning both the generative and the recognition weights. We demonstrate that this approach can be used to learn factorial codes."

The extracted information is then channeled through a feedforward chain of modules in successively higher visual areas for further analysis. Recent electrophysiological recordings from early visual neurons in awake behaving monkeys reveal that there are many levels of complexity in the information processing of the early visual cortex, as seen in the long-latency responses of its neurons. These new findings suggest that activity in the early visual cortex is tightly coupled and highly interactive with the rest of the visual system. They lead us to propose a new theoretical setting based on the mathematical framework of hierarchical Bayesian inference for reasoning about the visual system. In this framework, the recurrent feedforward/feedback loops in the cortex serve to integrate top-down contextual priors and bottom-up observations so as to implement concurrent probabilistic inference along the visual hierarchy. We suggest that the algorithms of particle filtering and Bayesian-belief propagation might model these interactive cortical computations. We review some recent neurophysiological evidences that support the plausibility of these ideas."

The advantage of our approach is that it suggests simple, novel extensions to overcomplete, undercomplete and multilayer non-linear versions of ICA. 1. ICA AS A CAUSAL GENERATIVE MODEL Factor analysis is based on a causal generative model in which an observation vector is generated in three stages. First, the activities of the factors (also known as latent or hidden variables) are chosen independently from one dimensional Gaussian priors. Next, these hidden activities are multiplied by a matrix of weights (the \u201cfactor loading\u201d matrix) to produce a noise-free observation vector. Finally, independent Gaussian \u201csensor noise\u201d is added to each component of the noise-free observation vector. Given an observation vector and a factor loading matrix, it is tractable to compute the posterior distribution of the hidden activities because this distribution is a Gaussian, though it generally has off-diagonal terms in the covariance matrix so it is not as simple as the prior distribution over hidden activities. ICA can also be viewed as a causal generative model [1, 2] that differs from factor analysis in two ways. First, the priors over the hidden activities remain independent but they are non-Gaussian. By itself, this modification would make it intractable to compute the posterior distribution over hidden activities. Tractability is restored by eliminating sensor noise and by using the same number of factors as input dimensions. This ensures that the posterior distribution over hidden activities collapses to a point. Interpreting ICA as a type of causal generative model suggests a number of ways in which it might be generalized, for instance to deal with more hidden units than input dimensions. Most of these generalizations retain marginal independence of the hidden activities and add sensor noise, but fail to preserve the property that the posterior distribution collapses to a point. As Funded by the Wellcome Trust and the Gatsby Charitable Foundation. a result inference is intractable and crude approximations are needed to model the posterior distribution, e.g., a MAP estimate in [3], a Laplace approximation in [4, 5] or more sophisticated variational approximations in [6]. 2. ICA AS AN ENERGY-BASED DENSITY MODEL We now describe a very different way of interpreting ICA as a probability density model. In the next section we describe how we can fit the model to data. The advantage of our energy-based view is that it suggests different generalizations of the basic ICA algorithm which preserve the computationally attractive property that the hidden activities are a simple deterministic function of the observed data. Instead of viewing the hidden factors as stochastic latent variables in a causal generative model, we view them as deterministic functions of the data with parameters . The hidden factors are then used for assigning an energy , to each possible observation vector :"

Almost all state.. o. f-the-art systems use statistical n-gram language models estimated on text corpora. One principle problem with such language models is the fact that many of the n-grams are never observed even in very large training corpora, and therefore it is common to back-off to a lower-order model. In this paper we propose to address this problem by carrying out the estimation task in a continuous space, enabling a smooth interpolation of the probabilities. A neural network is used to learn the projection of the words onto a continuous space and to estimate the n-gram probabilities. The connectionist language model is being evaluated on the DARPA HUB5 conversational telephone speech recognition task and preliminary results show consistent improvements in both perplexity and word error rate."

Energy-based models (EBM) associate an energy to those configurations, eliminating the need for proper normalization of probability distributions. Making a decision (an inference) with an EBM consists in comparing the energies associated with various configurations of the variable to be predicted, and choosing the one with the smallest energy. Such systems must be trained discriminatively to associate low energies to the desired configurations and higher energies to undesired configurations. A wide variety of loss function can be used for this purpose. We give sufficient conditions that a loss function should satisfy so that its minimization will cause the system to approach to desired behavior. We give many specific examples of suitable loss functions, and show an application to object recognition in images."

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

Labeled and unlabeled data are represented as vertices in a weighted graph, with edge weights encoding the similarity between instances. The learning problem is then formulated in terms of a Gaussian random field on this graph, where the mean of the field is characterized in terms of harmonic functions, and is efficiently obtained using matrix methods or belief propagation. The resulting learning algorithms have intimate connections with random walks, electric networks, and spectral graph theory. We discuss methods to incorporate class priors and the predictions of classifiers obtained by supervised learning. We also propose a method of parameter learning by entropy minimization, and show the algorithm's ability to perform feature selection. Promising experimental results are presented for synthetic data, digit classification, and text classification tasks."

Overcomplete bases allow for better approximation of the underlying statistical density. Using a Laplacian prior on the basis coefficients removes redundancy and leads to representations that are sparse and are a nonlinear function of the data. This can be viewed as a generalization of the technique of independent component analysis and provides a method for blind source separation of fewer mixtures than sources. We demonstrate the utility of overcomplete representations on natural speech and show that compared to the traditional Fourier basis the inferred representations potentially have much greater coding efficiency."

In a first stage, the method automatically identifies distinctive parts in the training set by applying a clustering algorithm to patterns selected by an interest operator. It then learns the statistical shape model using expectation maximization. The method achieves very good classification results on human faces and rear views of cars."

There may have been times when developments in neuroscience, artificial intelligence, or cognitive psychology seduced researchers into believing that their discipline was on the verge of discovering the secret of intelligence. But a humbling history of hopes disappointed has produced the realization that understanding the mind will challenge the power of all these methodologies combined. The work reported in this chapter rests on the conviction that a methodology that has a crucial role to play in the development of cognitive science is mathematical analysis. The success of cognitive science, like that of many other sciences, will, I believe, depend upon the construction of a solid body of theoretical results: results that express in a mathematical language the conceptual insights of the field; results that squeeze all possible implications out of those insights by exploiting powerful mathematical techniques. This body of results, which I will call the theory of information processing, exists because information is a concept that lends itself to mathematical formalization. One part of the theory of information processing is already well-developed. The classical theory of computation provides powerful and elegant results about the notion of effective procedure, including languages for precisely expressing them and theoretical machines for realizing them."

The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs-30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 10(6) optic nerve fibers-a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure."

                "text": "Many classification algorithms were originally designed for fixed-size vectors. Recent applications in text and speech processing and computational biology require however the analysis of variable-length sequences and more generally weighted automata. An approach widely used in statistical learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is that of kernel methods, due to their computational efficiency in high-dimensional feature spaces. We introduce a general family of kernels based on weighted transducers or rational relations, rational kernels , that extend kernel methods to the analysis of variable-length sequences or more generally weighted automata. We show that rational kernels can be computed efficiently using a general algorithm of composition of weighted transducers and a general single-source shortest-distance algorithm. Not all rational kernels are positive definite and symmetric (PDS), or equivalently verify the Mercer condition, a condition that guarantees the convergence of training for discriminant classification algorithms such as SVMs. We present several theoretical results related to PDS rational kernels. We show that under some general conditions these kernels are closed under sum, product, or Kleene-closure and give a general method for constructing a PDS rational kernel from an arbitrary transducer defined on some non-idempotent semirings. We give the proof of several characterization results that can be used to guide the design of PDS rational kernels. We also show that some commonly used string kernels or similarity measures such as the edit-distance, the convolution kernels of Haussler, and some string kernels used in the context of computational biology are specific instances of rational kernels. Our results include the proof that the edit-distance over a non-trivial alphabet is not negative definite, which, to the best of our knowledge, was never stated or proved before. Rational kernels can be combined with SVMs to form efficient and powerful techniques for a variety of classification tasks in text and speech processing, or computational biology. We describe examples of general families of PDS rational kernels that are useful in many of these applications and report the result of our experiments illustrating the use of rational kernels in several difficult large-vocabulary spoken-dialog classification tasks based on deployed spoken-dialog systems. Our results show that rational kernels are easy to design and implement and lead to substantial improvements of the classification accuracy."

The algorithm does not assume any knowledge of the input distributions, and is defined here for the zero-noise limit. Under these conditions, information maximization has extra properties not found in the linear case (Linsker 1989). The nonlinearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalization of principal components analysis. We apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to 10 speakers. We also show that a variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal). Finally, we derive dependencies of information transfer on time delays. We suggest that information maximization provides a unifying framework for problems in \"blind\" signal processing."

                "text": "Kernel-based learning algorithms work by embedding the data into a Euclidean space, and then searching for linear relations among the embedded data points. The embedding is performed implicitly, by specifying the inner products between each pair of points in the embedding space. This information is contained in the so-called kernel matrix, a symmetric and positive semidefinite matrix that encodes the relative positions of all points. Specifying this matrix amounts to specifying the geometry of the embedding space and inducing a notion of similarity in the input space---classical model selection problems in machine learning. In this paper we show how the kernel matrix can be learned from data via semidefinite programming (SDP) techniques. When applied to a kernel matrix associated with both training and test data this gives a powerful transductive algorithm---using the labeled part of the data one can learn an embedding also for the unlabeled part. The similarity between test points is inferred from training points and their labels. Importantly, these learning problems are convex, so we obtain a method for learning both the model class and the function without local minima. Furthermore, this approach leads directly to a convex method for learning the 2-norm soft margin parameter in support vector machines, solving an important open problem."

The network is self-organized by \u201clearning without a teacher\u201d, and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname \u201cneocognitron\u201d. After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consits of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of \u201cS-cells\u201d, which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of \u201cC-cells\u201d similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any \u201cteacher\u201d during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cell of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern."

As in the model of Serre, Wolf, and Poggio, we first apply Gabor filters at all positions and scales; feature complexity and position/scale invariance are then built up by alternating template matching and max pooling operations. We refine the approach in several biologically plausible ways. Sparsity is increased by constraining the number of feature inputs, lateral inhibition, and feature selection. We also demonstrate the value of retaining some position and scale information above the intermediate feature level. Our final model is competitive with current computer vision algorithms on several standard datasets, including the Caltech 101 object categories and the UIUC car localization task. The results further the case for biologically-motivated approaches to object classification."

Under the assumption that the data lie on a submanifold in a high dimensional space, we develop an algorithmic framework to classify a partially labeled data set in a principled manner. The central idea of our approach is that classification functions are naturally defined only on the sub-manifold in question rather than the total ambient space. Using the Laplace Beltrami operator one produces a basis for a Hilbert space of square integrable functions on the submanifold. To recover such a basis, only unlabeled examples are required. Once a basis is obtained, training can be performed using the labeled data set. Our algorithm models the manifold using the adjacency graph for the data and approximates the Laplace Beltrami operator by the graph Laplacian. Practical applications to image and text classification are considered."

The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large datasets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of datasets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualizations produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the datasets."

Recent research has been aimed at learning discriminative sparse models instead of purely reconstructive ones. This paper proposes a new step in that direction, with a novel sparse representation for signals belonging to different classes in terms of a shared dictionary and discriminative class models. The linear version of the proposed model admits a simple probabilistic interpretation, while its most general variant admits an interpretation in terms of kernels. An optimization framework for learning all the components of the proposed model is presented, along with experimental results on standard handwritten digit and texture classification tasks."

The RBF rules of signs provide tight bounds for the number of zeros of univariate networks with certain parameter restrictions. Moreover, they can be used to infer that the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension and pseudodimension of these networks are no more than linear. This contrasts with previous work showing that RBF neural networks with two or more input nodes have superlinear VC dimension. The rules also give rise to lower bounds for network sizes, thus demonstrating the relevance of network parameters for the complexity of computing with RBF neural networks."

The latent and visible variables at each time step receive directed connections from the visible variables at the last few time-steps. Such an architecture makes on-line inference efficient and allows us to use a simple approximate learning procedure. After training, the model finds a single set of parameters that simultaneously capture several different kinds of motion. We demonstrate the power of our approach by synthesizing various motion sequences and by performing on-line filling in of data lost during motion capture."

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund & R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148\u2013156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting.

Slow feature analysis (SFA) is a new method for learning invariant or slowly varying features from a vectorial input signal. It is based on a nonlinear expansion of the input signal and application of principal component analysis to this expanded signal and its time derivative. It is guaranteed to find the optimal solution within a family of functions directly and can learn to extract a large number of decor-related features, which are ordered by their degree of invariance. SFA can be applied hierarchically to process high-dimensional input signals and extract complex features. SFA is applied first to complex cell tuning properties based on simple cell output, including disparity and motion. Then more complicated input-output functions are learned by repeated application of SFA. Finally, a hierarchical network of SFA modules is presented as a simple model of the visual system. The same unstructured network can learn translation, size, rotation, contrast, or, to a lesser degree, illumination invariance for one-dimensional objects, depending on only the training stimulus. Surprisingly, only a few training objects suffice to achieve good generalization to new objects. The generated representation is suitable for object recognition. Performance degrades if the network is trained to learn multiple invariances simultaneously."

Given a novel video sequence, the model is able to categorize human actions in a frame-by-frame basis. We test the model on a publicly available human action dataset [2] and show that our new method performs well on the classification task. We also conducted control experiments to show that the use of the proposed mixture of hierarchical models improves the classification performance over bag of feature models. An additional experiment shows that using both dynamic and static features provides a richer representation of human actions when compared to the use of a single feature type, as demonstrated by our evaluation in the classification task."

We first discuss the geometry of feature space. In particular, we review what is known about the shape of the image of input space under the feature space map, and how this influences the capacity of SV methods. Following this, we describe how the metric governing the intrinsic geometry of the mapped surface can be computed in terms of the kernel, using the example of the class of inhomogeneous polynomial kernels, which are often used in SV pattern recognition. We then discuss the connection between feature space and input space by dealing with the question of how one can, given some vector in feature space, find a preimage (exact or approximate) in input space. We describe algorithms to tackle this issue, and show their utility in two applications of kernel methods. First, we use it to reduce the computational complexity of SV decision functions; second, we combine it with the Kernel PCA algorithm, thereby constructing a nonlinear statistical denoising technique which is shown to perform well on real-world data."

Our purpose is to demonstrate that nonlinear autoassociators actually behave differently from linear methods and that they can outperform these methods when used for latent extraction, projection, and classification. While linear autoassociators emulate PCA, and thus exhibit a flat or unimodal reconstruction error surface, autoassociators with nonlinearities in their hidden layer learn domains by building error reconstruction surfaces that, depending on the task, contain multiple local valleys. This interpolation bias allows nonlinear autoassociators to represent appropriate classifications of nonlinear multimodal domains, in contrast to linear autoassociators, which are inappropriate for such tasks. In fact, autoassociators with hidden unit nonlinearities can be shown to perform nonlinear classification and nonlinear recognition."

This is the case in problems where data points actually simultaneously belong to multiple, overlapping clusters. For example a particular gene may have several functions, therefore belonging to several distinct clusters of genes, and a biologist may want to discover these through unsupervised modeling of gene expression data. We present a new nonparametric Bayesian method, the Infinite Overlapping Mixture Model (IOMM), for modeling overlapping clusters. The IOMM uses exponential family distributions to model each cluster and forms an overlapping mixture by taking products of such distributions, much like products of experts (Hinton, 2002). The IOMM allows an unbounded number of clusters, and assignments of points to (multiple) clusters is modeled using an Indian Buffet Process (IBP), (Griffiths and Ghahramani, 2006). The IOMM has the desirable properties of being able to focus in on overlapping regions while maintaining the ability to model a potentially infinite number of clusters which may overlap. We derive MCMC inference algorithms for the IOMM and show that these can be used to cluster movies into multiple genres. \u2217ZG is also an Associate Research Professor in the Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University"

A large dataset comprising stereo image pairs of 50 uniform-colored toys under 36 azimuths, 9 elevations, and 6 lighting conditions was collected (for a total of 194,400 individual images). The objects were 10 instances of 5 generic categories: four-legged animals, human figures, airplanes, trucks, and cars. Five instances of each category were used for training, and the other five for testing. Low-resolution grayscale images of the objects with various amounts of variability and surrounding clutter were used for training and testing. Nearest neighbor methods, support vector machines, and convolutional networks, operating on raw pixels or on PCA-derived features were tested. Test error rates for unseen object instances placed on uniform backgrounds were around 13% for SVM and 7% for convolutional nets. On a segmentation/recognition task with highly cluttered images, SVM proved impractical, while convolutional nets yielded 16/7% error. A real-time version of the system was implemented that can detect and classify objects in natural scenes at around 10 frames per second."

Our approach couples topic models originally developed for text analysis with spatial transformations, and thus consistently accounts for geometric constraints. By building integrated scene models, we may discover contextual relationships, and better exploit partially labeled training images. We first consider images of isolated objects, and show that sharing parts among object categories improves detection accuracy when learning from few examples. Turning to multiple object scenes, we propose nonparametric models which use Dirichlet processes to automatically learn the number of parts underlying each object category, and objects composing each scene. The resulting transformed Dirichlet process (TDP) leads to Monte Carlo algorithms which simultaneously segment and recognize objects in street and office scenes.\n"

This problem can be expressed in information theoretic terms as coding and transmitting a multi-dimensional, analog signal over a set of noisy channels. Previously, we have shown that robust, overcomplete codes can be learned by minimizing the reconstruction error with a constraint on the channel capacity. Here, we present a theoretical analysis that characterizes the optimal linear coder and decoder for one- and two-dimensional data. The analysis allows for an arbitrary number of coding units, thus including both under- and over-complete representations, and provides a number of important insights into optimal coding strategies. In particular, we show how the form of the code adapts to the number of coding units and to different data and noise conditions to achieve robustness. We also report numerical solutions for robust coding of high-dimensional image data and show that these codes are substantially more robust compared against other image codes such as ICA and wavelets."

Typically, one then has to resort to Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, or approximations of the normalization constant. Here, we propose that such models can be estimated by minimizing the expected squared distance between the gradient of the log-density given by the model and the gradient of the log-density of the observed data. While the estimation of the gradient of log-density function is, in principle, a very difficult non-parametric problem, we prove a surprising result that gives a simple formula for this objective function. The density function of the observed data does not appear in this formula, which simplifies to a sample average of a sum of some derivatives of the log-density given by the model. The validity of the method is demonstrated on multivariate Gaussian and independent component analysis models, and by estimating an overcomplete filter set for natural image data."

A second stage of more invariant features is fed with patches provided by the first stage feature extractor, and is trained in the same way. The method is used to pre-train the first four layers of a deep convolutional network which achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.

We should therefore strive to develop learning algorithms tha t use the data to determine the depth of the final architecture. Depth of architecture is connected to the notion of highly-v arying functions. We argue that, in general, deep architectures can compactly represent highly-varying fun ctio s which would otherwise require a very large size to be represented with an inappropriate architecture. W say that a function is highly-varying when a piecewise approximation (e.g., piecewise-constant or pi ecewise-linear) of that function would require a large number of pieces. A deep architecture is a composition of many operations, and it could in any case be represented by a possibly very large depth-2 architectur . The composition of computational units in a small but deep circuit can actually be seen as an efficient fac torization of a large but shallow circuit. Reorganizing the way in which computational units are composed c an have a drastic effect on the efficiency of representation size. For example, whereas the polynomial \u220fn i=1 \u2211m j=1 aijxj can be represented efficiently as a product of sums, with only O(mn) computational elements, it would be very inefficiently repr esented with a sum of product architecture, requiring O(n) computational elements. Further examples suggesting greater expressive power of de ep architectures and their potential for AI and machine learning are also discussed in Bengio and Le Cun (200 7). An earlier discussion of the expected advantages of deeper architectures in a more cognitive pers pective is found in Utgoff and Stracuzzi (2002). Having established some theoretical grounds justifying th e need for learning deep architectures, we next turn to a related question: deep architectures can represent hig hly-varying functions compactly, with less computational elements than there are variations in the repres nt d function, but many state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms do not have that characteristic."

In the above equation, f(x) could be the discriminant function of a classifier, or the out put of regression predictor. A kernel is local, when K(x, xi) > \u03c1 is true forx in some connected region around xi. The size of that region can usually be controlled by a hyper-parameter. An example of local kernel is t he Gaussian kernel K(x, xi) = ei (2)/\u03c3(2) , where\u03c3 controls the size of the region around xi. We can see the Gaussian kernel as computing a soft conjunction, because it can be written as a product of one-dimen sional conditions: K(u, v) = \u220f i e \u2212(ui\u2212vi) (2)/\u03c3(2) . If |ui \u2212 vi|/\u03c3 is small for alli, then the pattern matches and K(u, v) is large. If |ui \u2212 vi|/\u03c3 is large for a singlei, then there is no match and K(u, v) is small. Well-known example of kernel machines include Support Vect or Machines (SVMs) (Boser, Guyon, & Vapnik, 1992; Cortes & Vapnik, 1995) and Gaussian processes (Wi lliams & Rasmussen, 1996) 2 for classification and regression, but also classical non-parametric lea rning algorithms for classification, regression and density estimation, such as the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, Nadaraya-Watson or Parzen wi ndo s density and regression estimators, etc. In Section 3.2 we discuss manifold learning algorithmsuch as Isomap and LLE that can also be seen as local kernel machines, as well as r elated semi-supervised learning algorithms also based on the construction of a neighborhood graph (with one node per example and arcs between neighboring examples). Kernel machines with a local kernel yield generalization by exploiting what could be called the smoothness prior : the assumption that the target function is smooth or can be w ell approximated with a smooth function. For example, in supervised learning, if we have the training example(xi, yi), then it makes sense to construct a predictorf(x) which will output something close to yi whenx is close toxi. Note how this prior requires defining a notion of proximity in input space. This is a useful prior, but one of the claims made in Bengio, Delalleau, and Le Roux (2006) and Bengio and Le Cun (2007) is t hat such a prior if often insufficient to generalize when the target function is highly-varying in in put space (according to the notion of proximity embedded in the prior or kernel)."

We analyse its theoretical properties, proving that it is sharply concentrated around its expected value, and we discuss its relation with other standard measures of performance. Finally we describe some of the algorithms that can be obtained within this framework, giving experimental results showing that adapting the kernel to improve alignment on the labelled data significantly increases the alignment on the test set, giving improved classification accuracy.

Methods for efficiently searching this incredibly rich resource are vital for a large number of applications. These include object recognition, computer graphics, personal photo collections, online image search tools. In this paper, our goal is to develop efficient image search and scene matching techniques that are not only fast, but also require very little memory, enabling their use on standard hardware or even on handheld devices. Our approach uses recently developed machine learning techniques to convert the Gist descriptor (a real valued vector that describes orientation energies at different scales and orientations within an image) to a compact binary code, with a few hundred bits per image. Using our scheme, it is possible to perform real-time searches with millions from the Internet using a single large PC and obtain recognition results comparable to the full descriptor. Using our codes on high quality labeled images from the LabelMe database gives surprisingly powerful recognition results using simple nearest neighbor techniques."

In the square linear blind source separation problem without time delays, \none must find an unmixing matrix which can detangle the result of mixing n unknown independent sources \nthrough an unknown n x n mixing matrix. The recently introduced ICA blind source separation algorithm \n(Baram and Roth 1994; Bell and Sejnowski 1995) is a powerful and surprisingly simple technique for solving \nthis problem. ICA is all the more remarkable for performing so well despite making absolutely no use of the \ntemporal structure of its input! This paper presents a new algorithm, contextual ICA, which derives from a \nmaximum likelihood density estimation formulation of the problem. cICA can incorporate arbitrarily complex \nadaptive history-sensitive source models, and thereby make use of the temporal structure of its input. \nThis allows it to separate in a number of situations where standard ICA cannot, including sources with low \nkurtosis, colored gaussian sources, and sources which have gaussian histograms. Since ICA is a special case \nof cICA, the MLE derivation provides as a corollary a rigorous derivation of classic ICA."

A principled approach to semi-supervised learning is to design a classifying function which is sufficiently smooth with respect to the intrinsic structure collectively revealed by known labeled and unlabeled points. We present a simple algorithm to obtain such a smooth solution. Our method yields encouraging experimental results on a number of classification problems and demonstrates effective use of unlabeled data."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

Whereas spectral embedding methods provided only coordinates for the training points, the analysis justifies a simple extension to out-of-sample examples (the Nystrm formula) for multidimensional scaling (MDS), spectral clustering, Laplacian eigenmaps, locally linear embedding (LLE), and Isomap. The analysis provides, for all such spectral embedding methods, the definition of a loss function, whose empirical average is minimized by the traditional algorithms. The asymptotic expected value of that loss defines a generalization performance and clarifies what these algorithms are trying to learn. Experiments with LLE, Isomap, spectral clustering, and MDS show that this out-of-sample embedding formula generalizes well, with a level of error comparable to the effect of small perturbations of the training set on the embedding."

Unlike a standard mixture model which assumes that each data point belongs to one and only one mixture component, or cluster, a partial membership model allows data points to have fractional membership in multiple clusters. Algorithms which assign data points partial memberships to clusters can be useful for tasks such as clustering genes based on microarray data (Gasch & Eisen, 2002). Our Bayesian Partial Membership Model (BPM) uses exponential family distributions to model each cluster, and a product of these distibtutions, with weighted parameters, to model each datapoint. Here the weights correspond to the degree to which the datapoint belongs to each cluster. All parameters in the BPM are continuous, so we can use Hybrid Monte Carlo to perform inference and learning. We discuss relationships between the BPM and Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Mixed Membership models, Exponential Family PCA, and fuzzy clustering. Lastly, we show some experimental results and discuss nonparametric extensions to our model."

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

We show, both theoretically and empirically, how the fragmentation problem adversely affects predictive accuracy as variation \u2207 (a measure of concept difficulty) increases. Applying feature-construction techniques at every tree node, which we implement on a decision tree inducer DALI, is proved to only partially solve the fragmentation problem. Our study illustrates how a more robust solution must also assess the value of each partial hypothesis by recurring to all available training data, an approach we name global data analysis, which decision tree induction alone is unable to accomplish. The value of global data analysis is evaluated by comparing modified versions of C4.5 rules with C4.5 trees and DALI, on both artificial and real-world domains. Empirical results suggest the importance of combining both feature construction and global data analysis to solve the fragmentation problem."

The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text."

We wish to recover an input vector f/spl isin/R/sup n/ from corrupted measurements y=Af+e. Here, A is an m by n (coding) matrix and e is an arbitrary and unknown vector of errors. Is it possible to recover f exactly from the data y? We prove that under suitable conditions on the coding matrix A, the input f is the unique solution to the /spl lscr//sub 1/-minimization problem (/spl par/x/spl par//sub /spl lscr/1/:=/spl Sigma//sub i/|x/sub i/|) min(g/spl isin/R/sup n/) /spl par/y - Ag/spl par//sub /spl lscr/1/ provided that the support of the vector of errors is not too large, /spl par/e/spl par//sub /spl lscr/0/:=|{i:e/sub i/ /spl ne/ 0}|/spl les//spl rho//spl middot/m for some /spl rho/>0. In short, f can be recovered exactly by solving a simple convex optimization problem (which one can recast as a linear program). In addition, numerical experiments suggest that this recovery procedure works unreasonably well; f is recovered exactly even in situations where a significant fraction of the output is corrupted. This work is related to the problem of finding sparse solutions to vastly underdetermined systems of linear equations. There are also significant connections with the problem of recovering signals from highly incomplete measurements. In fact, the results introduced in this paper improve on our earlier work. Finally, underlying the success of /spl lscr//sub 1/ is a crucial property we call the uniform uncertainty principle that we shall describe in detail."

Global minimization problems are difficult to solve when the objective functions have many local minimizers, such as the energy functions for protein folding. In our approach, to avoid directly minimizing a \u201cdifficult\u201d function, a special integral transformation is introduced to transform the function into a class of gradually deformed, but \u201csmoother\u201d or \u201ceasier\u201d functions. An optimization procedure is then applied to the new functions successively, to trace their solutions back to the original function. The method can be applied to a large class of nonlinear partially separable functions including energy functions for molecular conformation and protein folding. Mathematical theory for the method, as a special continuation approach to global optimization, is established. Algorithms with different solution tracing strategies are developed. Different levels of parallelism are exploited for the implementation of the algorithms on massively parallel architectures."

In online convex programming, the convex set is known in advance, but in each step of some repeated optimization problem, one must select a point in F before seeing the cost function for that step. This can be used to model factory production, farm production, and many other industrial optimization problems where one is unaware of the value of the items produced until they have already been constructed. We introduce an algorithm for this domain. We also apply this algorithm to repeated games, and show that it is really a generalization of infinitesimal gradient ascent, and the results here imply that generalized infinitesimal gradient ascent (GIGA) is universally consistent."

If the things are found to be concentrated in a small area of the region of each class in the measurement space then the deviations will be small, and with reference to the average class properties most of the information about a thing is given by naming the class to which it belongs. In this case the information may be recorded much more briefly than if a classification had not been used. We suggest that the best classification is that which results in the briefest recording of all the attribute information. In this context, we will regard the measurements of each thing as being a message about that thing. Shannon (1948) showed that where messages may be regarded as each nominating the occurrence of a particular event among a universe of possible events, the information needed to record a series of such messages is minimised if the messages are encoded so that the length of each message is proportional to minus the logarithm of the relative frequency of occurrence of the event which it nominates. The information required is greatest when all frequencies are equal. The messages here nominate the positions in measurement space of the 5 1 points representing the attributes of the things. If the expected density of points in the measurement space is everywhere uniform, the positions of the points cannot be encoded more briefly than by a simple list of the measured values. However, if the expected density is markedly non-uniform, application"

Besides the methods of Cross-Validation and Leave-One-Out, minimizing some upper bounds on the generalization error, such as the radius-margin bound, was also proposed to more efficiently learn the optimal kernel parameters. In this paper, a class separability criterion is proposed for learning kernel parameters. The optimal kernel parameters are regarded as those that can maximize the class separability in the induced feature space. With this criterion, learning the kernel parameters in SVM can avoid solving the quadratic programming problem. The relationship between this criterion and the radius-margin bound is also explored. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the class separability criterion is effective in learning kernel parameters for SVM."

The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents (\u201csemantic structure\u201d) in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising."

Recently, a number of authors have demonstrated good performance on this task using methods that are based on eigenvectors of the affinity matrix. These approaches are extremely attractive in that they are based on simple eigendecomposition algorithms whose stability is well understood. Nevertheless, the use of eigendecompositions in the context of segmentation is far from well understood. In this paper we give a unified treatment of these algorithms, and show the close connections between them while highlighting their distinguishing features. We then prove results on eigenvectors of block matrices that allow us to analyze the performance of these algorithms in simple grouping settings. Finally, we use our analysis to motivate a variation on the existing methods that combines aspects from different eigenvector segmentation algorithms. We illustrate our analysis with results on real and synthetic images."

More complex, better suited distance measures are often expensive and rather ad-hoc (elastic matching, deformable templates). We propose a new distance measure which (a) can be made locally invariant to any set of transformations of the input and (b) can be computed efficiently. We tested the method on large handwritten character databases provided by the Post Office and the NIST. Using invariances with respect to translation, rotation, scaling, shearing and line thickness, the method consistently outperformed all other systems tested on the same databases."

We consider the case where only a subset of the distances between atoms is given and formulate this distance geometry problem as a global minimization problem with special structure. We show that global smoothing techniques and a continuation approach for global optimization can be used to determine global solutions of this problem reliably and efficiently. The global continuation approach determines a global solution with less computational effort than is required by a standard multistart algorithm. Moreover, the continuation approach usually finds the global solution from any given starting point, while the multistart algorithm tends to fail."

The analysis holds under mild assumptions on the inputs and the cost function. The method of analysis is based on an asymptotic analysis of fixed stepsize adaptive algorithms and gives almost sure results regarding the behavior of the parameter estimates, whereas previous stochastic analyses typically consider mean and mean square behavior. The parameter estimates are shown to enter a small neighborhood about the optimum value and remain there for a finite length of time. Furthermore, almost sure exponential bounds are given for the rate of convergence of the parameter estimates. The asymptotic distribution of the parameter estimates is shown to be Gaussian with mean equal to the optimum value and covariance matrix that depends on the input statistics. Specific adaptive algorithms that fall under the framework of this paper are signed error least mean squre (LMS), dual sign LMS, quantized state LMS, least mean fourth, dead zone algorithms, momentum algorithms, and leaky LMS."

Action potentials and postsynaptic effects of glutamate are predicted to consume much of the energy (47% and 34%, respectively), with the resting potential consuming a smaller amount (13%), and glutamate recycling using only 3%. Energy usage depends strongly on action potential rate\u2014an increase in activity of 1 action potential/cortical neuron/s will raise oxygen consumption by 145 mL/100 g grey matter/h. The energy expended on signaling is a large fraction of the total energy used by the brain; this favors the use of energy efficient neural codes and wiring patterns. Our estimates of energy usage predict the use of distributed codes, with \u226415% of neurons simultaneously active, to reduce energy consumption and allow greater computing power from a fixed number of neurons. Functional magnetic resonance imaging signals are likely to be dominated by changes in energy usage associated with synaptic currents and action potential propagation."

Skinner never actually shaped an operant response by hand until a memorable incident of startling serendipity on the top floor of a flour mill in Minneapolis in 1943. That occasion appears to have been a genuine eureka experience for Skinner, causing him to appreciate as never before the significance of reinforcement mediated by biological connections with the animate social environment, as opposed to purely mechanical connections with the inanimate physical environment. This insight stimulated him to coin a new term (shaping), and also led directly to a shift in his perspective on verbal behavior from an emphasis on antecedents and molecular topographical details to an emphasis on consequences and more molar, functional properties in which the social dyad inherent to the shaping process became the definitive property of verbal behavior. Moreover, the insight seems to have emboldened Skinner to explore the greater implications of his behaviorism for human behavior writ large, an enterprise that characterized the bulk of his post-World War II scholarship."

The model may be imbedded in the same job step or it may be a separate job step. Similarly, there may be several subsets which must be extracted before the link to a model is made. The paper also demonstrates some of the fundamental advantages of a Data Base Language including macro-type statements, utility calls, hold files, simple sorts and the use of a Data Description Table (DDT) which may be incorporated in a program by a one line Call statement."

We show that the, Gaussian transform can be viewed as a special case of a generalized transform and that these generalized transforms share many of the properties of the Gaussian transform. We also show that the smoothing behavior of the generalized transform can be studied in terms of the Fourier transform and that these results indicate that the Gaussian transform has superior smoothing properties."

Note that deep convolutional neural networks (LeCun, Boser, Denker, Henderson, Howard, Hubbard, & Jackel, 1989; Le Cun, Bottou, Ben gio, & Haffner, 1998; Simard, Steinkraus, & Platt, 2003; Ranzato et al., 2007) were found easier to trai n, as discussed in Section 4.5, for reasons that have yet to be really clarified. Many unreported negative observations as well as the experi mental results in Bengio et al. (2007), Erhan et al. (2009) suggest that gradient-based training of deep s upervised multi-layer neural networks (starting from random initialization) gets stuck in \u201capparent local m ini a or plateaus\u201d 4, and that as the architecture gets deeper, it becomes more difficult to obtain good general ization. When starting from random initialization, the solutions obtained with deeper neural networks ap pe r to correspond to poor solutions that perform worse than the solutions obtained for networks with 1 or 2 hid den layers (Bengio et al., 2007; Larochelle, Bengio, Louradour, & Lamblin, 2009). This happens even thou gh k + 1-layer nets can easily represent what ak-layer net can represent (without much added capacity), whe reas the converse is not true. However, it was discovered (Hinton et al., 2006) that much bette r results could be achieved when pre-training each layer with an unsupervised learning algorithm, one lay r fter the other, starting with the first layer (that directly takes in input the observed x). The initial experiments used the RBM generative model for each layer (Hinton et al., 2006), and were followed by experi m nts yielding similar results using variations of auto-encoders for training each layer (Bengio et al., 200 7; Ranzato et al., 2007; Vincent et al., 2008). Most of these papers exploit the idea of greedy layer-wise un supervised learning (developed in more detail in the next section): first train the lower layer with an u s pervised learning algorithm (such as one for the RBM or some auto-encoder), giving rise to an initial s et of parameter values for the first layer of a neural network. Then use the output of the first layer (a new r epresentation for the raw input) as input for another layer, and similarly initialize that layer with an unsupervised learning algorithm. After having thus initialized a number of layers, the whole neural networ k can be fine-tuned with respect to a supervised training criterion as usual. The advantage of unsupervised pr -training versus random initialization was clearly demonstrated in several statistical comparisons ( Bengio et al., 2007; Larochelle et al., 2007, 2009; Erhan et al., 2009). What principles might explain the impro vement in classification error observed in the literature when using unsupervised pre-training? One clue may help to identify the principles behind the success of some training algorithms for deep architectures , and it comes from algorithms that exploit neither RBMs nor auto-encoders (Weston et al., 2008; Mobahi et al., 2 009). What these algorithms have in common with the training algorithms based on RBMs and auto-encoder s is layer-local unsupervised criteria , i.e., the idea that injecting anunsupervised training signal at each layer may help to guide the parameters of that layer towards better regions in parameter space. In Weston e t al. (2008), the neural networks are trained using pairs of examples (x, x\u0303), which are either supposed to be \u201cneighbors\u201d (or of the same c lass) or not. Considerh(x) the level-k representation of x in the model. A local training criterion is defined at each layer that pushes the intermediate representations h(x) andh(x\u0303) either towards each other or away from each other, according to whether x andx\u0303 are supposed to be neighbors or not (e.g., k-nearest neighbors in input space). The same criterion had already been used succe ssfully to learn a low-dimensional embedding with an unsupervised manifold learning algorithm (Hadsell , Chopra, & LeCun, 2006) but is here (Weston et al., 2008) applied at one or more intermediate layer of the neural network. Following the idea of slow feature analysis (Wiskott & Sejnowski, 2002), Mobahi et al. (2009), Bergstra and Bengio (2010) exploit the temporal constancy of high-level abstraction to provid e an unsupervised guide to intermediate layers: successive frames are likely to contain the same object."

However, it was discovered (Hinton et al., 2006) that much bette r results could be achieved when pre-training each layer with an unsupervised learning algorithm, one lay r fter the other, starting with the first layer (that directly takes in input the observed x). The initial experiments used the RBM generative model for each layer (Hinton et al., 2006), and were followed by experi m nts yielding similar results using variations of auto-encoders for training each layer (Bengio et al., 200 7; Ranzato et al., 2007; Vincent et al., 2008). Most of these papers exploit the idea of greedy layer-wise un supervised learning (developed in more detail in the next section): first train the lower layer with an u s pervised learning algorithm (such as one for the RBM or some auto-encoder), giving rise to an initial s et of parameter values for the first layer of a neural network. Then use the output of the first layer (a new r epresentation for the raw input) as input for another layer, and similarly initialize that layer with an unsupervised learning algorithm. After having thus initialized a number of layers, the whole neural networ k can be fine-tuned with respect to a supervised training criterion as usual. The advantage of unsupervised pr -training versus random initialization was clearly demonstrated in several statistical comparisons ( Bengio et al., 2007; Larochelle et al., 2007, 2009; Erhan et al., 2009). What principles might explain the impro vement in classification error observed in the literature when using unsupervised pre-training? One clue may help to identify the principles behind the success of some training algorithms for deep architectures , and it comes from algorithms that exploit neither RBMs nor auto-encoders (Weston et al., 2008; Mobahi et al., 2 009). What these algorithms have in common with the training algorithms based on RBMs and auto-encoder s is layer-local unsupervised criteria , i.e., the idea that injecting anunsupervised training signal at each layer may help to guide the parameters of that layer towards better regions in parameter space. In Weston e t al. (2008), the neural networks are trained using pairs of examples (x, x\u0303), which are either supposed to be \u201cneighbors\u201d (or of the same c lass) or not."

The size of that region can usually be controlled by a hyper -parameter of the kernel function. An example of local kernel is the Gaussian kernel K(x,xi) = ei (2)/\u03c3(2) , where\u03c3 controls the size of the region aroundxi. We can see the Gaussian kernel as computing a soft conjuncti on, because it can be written as a product of one-dimensional conditions: K(u,v) = \u220f j e \u2212(uj\u2212vj) (2)/\u03c3(2) . If |uj \u2212 vj |/\u03c3 is small for all dimensionsj, then the pattern matches and K(u,v) is large. If |uj \u2212 vj |/\u03c3 is large for a singlej, then there is no match and K(u,v) is small. Well-known examples of kernel machines include Support Vec or Machines (SVMs) (Boser, Guyon, & Vapnik, 1992; Cortes & Vapnik, 1995) and Gaussian processes (Williams & Rasmussen, 1996) 3 for classification and regression, but also classical non-parametric l arning algorithms for classification, regression and density estimation, such as the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, Nadaraya-Watson or Parzen wi ndo s density and regression estimators, etc. Below, we discuss manifold learning algorithmsuch as Isomap and LLE that can also be seen as local kernel machines, as well as related s emi-supervised learning algorithms also based on the construction of aneighborhood graph(with one node per example and arcs between neighboring examples). Kernel machines with a local kernel yield generalization by exploiting what could be called the smoothness prior : the assumption that the target function is smooth or can be w ell approximated with a smooth function. For example, in supervised learning, if we have th e training example(xi, yi), then it makes sense to construct a predictor f(x) which will output something close to yi whenx is close toxi. Note how this prior requires defining a notion of proximity in input space. This is a useful prior, but one of the claims made in Bengio, Delalleau, and Le Roux (2006) and Bengio and L eCun (2007) is that such a prior is often insufficient to generalize when the target function is highl y-varying in input space. The limitations of a fixed generic kernel such as the Gaussian ker el have motivated a lot of research in designing kernelsbased on prior knowledge about the task (Jaakkola & Haussler , 1998; Sch\u00f6lkopf, Mika, Burges, Knirsch, M\u00fcller, R\u00e4tsch, & Smola, 1999b; G\u00e4rtne , 2003; Cortes, Haffner, & Mohri, 2004). However, if we lack sufficient prior knowledge for designing an a ppropriate kernel, can we learn it? This question also motivated much research (Lanckriet, Cristianini, Bar tlett, El Gahoui, & Jordan, 2002; Wang & Chan, 2002; Cristianini, Shawe-Taylor, Elisseeff, & Kandola, 20 0 ), and deep architectures can be viewed as a promising development in this direction. It has been shown t hat a Gaussian Process kernel machine can be improved using a Deep Belief Network to learn a feature spa ce (Salakhutdinov & Hinton, 2008): after training the Deep Belief Network, its parameters are used to ini ialize a deterministic non-linear transformation (a multi-layer neural network) that computes a featu re vector (a new feature space for the data), and that transformation can be tuned to minimize the prediction error made by the Gaussian process, using a gradient-based optimization. The feature space can be seen as a learned representation of the data. Good representations bring close to each other examples which sh are abstract characteristics that are relevant factors of variation of the data distribution. Learning algori thms for deep architectures can be seen as ways to learn a good feature space for kernel machines. Consider one directionv in which a target functionf (what the learner should ideally capture) goes up and down (i.e. as\u03b1 increases,f(x + \u03b1v) \u2212 b crosses 0, becomes positive, then negative, positive, then negative, etc.), in a series of \u201cbumps\u201d.
