A hierarchical structure is proposed to represent the structure of a form by using lines and the XY-tree approach. The approach is top-down and no domain knowledge such as the preprinted data or filled-in data is used. Geometrical modifications and slight variations are handled by this representation. Logically identical forms are associated to the same or similar hierarchical structure. Identification and the retrieval of similar forms are performed by computing the edit distances between the generated trees."

The proposed method represents the cell structure by the location of the center points of each cell. This representation allows the form identification to be realized by a process of matching the points in an input image to the points in registered forms. We have implemented the point matching process using the two-dimensional hash table. This implementation enables the system to robustly identify an input form even if it is skewed or deformed by a scanning process, and to reduce the time for the identification. Moreover, the similarity between two forms defined by the implementation can be used to evaluate the identification ability when a set of registered forms is specified. Experimental results show the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed technique."

The outline of this method is described as follows. First, ruled lines are extracted from the input image of a form. After that, several lines are grouped as one to be recognised as data corresponding to a sub-form. These lines and sub-forms are both used for understanding the form, taking into account their feature attributes and the relationships between them. Each feature in the input image of a form is expected to correspond to a feature in one of the model forms, which are described as structured features. This correspondence is represented by a node in an association graph, where an arc represents compatible correspondences established on the basis of feature relationships. The best match is found as the largest maximal clique in the association graph. Experimental results show the method is robust and effective for document images of poor quality, and also for various styles of forms."

The form modeling module builds explicit representations of scanned form templates to facilitate form recognition and dropout. It can also assist a user to define various fields on a form. The automatic form recognition eliminates the need for manually sorting input forms. The form dropout module effectively removes pre-printed form content to achieve a high data compression rate and to provide clean data for OCR. Our model-driven form dropout scheme has two major advantages over image-based subtraction methods in both dropout efficiency and quality preservation of filled-in data."

However, these approaches are applicable to only the same kind of documents because they are based on the paradigm that specifies the structure definition information in advance so as to be able to analyze a particular class of documents intelligently. In this paper, the authors propose a method to recognize the layout structures of multi-kinds of table-form document images. For this purpose, the authors introduce a classification tree to manage the relationships among different classes of layout structures. The authors' recognition system has two modes: layout knowledge acquisition and layout structure recognition. In the layout knowledge acquisition mode, table-form document images are distinguished according to this. Classification tree and then the structure description trees which specify the logical structures of table-form documents are generated automatically. While, in the layout structure recognition mode, individual item fields in the table-form document images are extracted and classified successfully by searching the classification tree and interpreting the structure description tree. >"

The paper presents a method called Box Driven Reasoning (BDR) to robustly analyze the structure of table form documents which include touching characters and broken lines. Most previous methods employ a line oriented approach. Real documents are copied repeatedly and overlaid with printed data, resulting in characters which touch cells and lines which are broken. BDR deals with regions directly, in contrast with other previous methods. Experimental tests show that BDR reliably recognizes cells and strings in document images with touching characters and broken lines."
