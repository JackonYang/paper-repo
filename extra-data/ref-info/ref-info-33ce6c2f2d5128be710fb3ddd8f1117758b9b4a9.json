                "text": "We propose a model of direction-sensitive units in human vision. It is a modified and elaborated version of a model by Reichardt [Z. Naturforsch . Teil B 12, 447 (1957)]. The model is applied to threshold experiments in which subjects view adjacent vertical bars with independently (typically sinusoidally), temporally modulated luminances. The subject must report whether the patterns moved to the left or to the right. According to the model, a basic motion-detecting unit consists of two subunits tuned to opposite directions. Each performs a spatial and temporal linear filtering of its input; outputs of the filters are multiplied, and the multiplied output is integrated (for a time that is long relative to the modulation period). The model's output consists of the difference between the subunit outputs. Direction of movement is indicated by the sign of the model output. Mathematical analysis of the model yielded several predictions that were confirmed experimentally. Specifically, we found that (1) performance with complex patterns can be predicted by spatiotemporal Fourier analysis that results in the segregation and linear addition in the output for different temporal frequencies; (2) under special conditions, performance depends on the product of adjacent bar amplitudes, offering strong support for the multiplication principle; (3) performance is unaffected by addition of stationary patterns; and (4) addition of homogeneous flicker normally produces no effect but under special conditions reverses perceived direction. These and other results confirm our model and reject several other models, including Reichardt 's original model."

We derive the spatiotemporal-frequency spectra for some simple moving images and illustrate how these spectra are altered by sampling in the time domain. We construct a simple model of the human perceiver that predicts the critical sample rate required to render sampled and continuous moving images indistinguishable. The rate is shown to depend on the spatial and the temporal acuity of the observer and on the velocity and spatial-frequency content of the image. Several predictions of this model are tested and confirmed. The model is offered as an explanation of many of the phenomena known as apparent motion.

Because there is a family of physical motions of various directions and speeds that appear identical, the motion of the grating is ambiguous. In contrast, when two crossed moving gratings are superimposed, the resulting plaid pattern usually moves unambiguously and predictably. In certain cases, however, two gratings do not combine into a single coherent percept, but appear to slide across one another. We have studied the conditions under which coherence does and does not occur, and we report here that it depends on the relative contrasts, spatial frequencies and directions of motion of the gratings. These effects may reveal the previously unstudied properties of a higher order stage of motion analysis."

How similar must successive pictures be to give apparent movement? This is the 'correspondence problem'. Manipulations of the local and global correspondences between pictures included motion phenomena such as reversed apparent movement; a four-stroke oscillatory cycle which gave an illusion of continuous motion in one direction; edges defined by texture, stereoscopic depth, or flicker, kinetic edges; and wave motion. It was concluded that human motion perception may comprise two separate mechanisms. Local point-by-point correlations between pictures are detected by a relatively peripheral system, probably based on directonally selective neural units. More subtle global correspondences are analysed by a more cognitive system which extracts edges before it process motion."

The Fourier transforms of these constant-velocity passbands have the same form as retinal receptive fields of various sizes. At low velocities, in the range of the natural drift motions of the eye, the stabilized contrast-sensitivity function matches the normal, unstablized result. At higher velocities (corresponding to motions of objects in the environment), this curve maintains the same shape but shifts toward lower spatial frequencies. The constant-velocity passband is displaced across the spatio-temporal frequency domain in a manner that is almost symmetric about the constant-velocity plane at v = 2 deg/s. Interpolating these diagonal profiles by a suitable analytic expression, we construct the spatio-temporal threshold surface for stabilized vision, and display its properties in terms of the usual frequency parameters; e.g., at low spatial frequencies, the temporal response becomes nearly independent of spatial frequency, while at low temporal frequencies, the spatial response becomes independent of temporal frequency."

The success with which the perception of motion is produced depends or. factors such as the fineness of the raster and the temporal and spatiai reiationships of the stimulus points. For a given velocity, the more points there are on the movement trajectory, and the closer their spacing, the better is the perceived movement. Moderately slow retinal velocities (on the order of .4 to .8 deg/sec) produce the highest quality of perceived movement. One can discriminate among possible subclasses of movement detectors by presenting a complex sequence of intensities at two or more points and varying their cross correlation. Motion between two areas can be perceived even when there is zero correlation between the spatial patterns in each location. Perceived motion can be of rotation, as well as of translation. The two-dimensional shadow of a rotating three-dimensional wire figure is perceived as a rotating, rigid, three-dimensional wire figure (the kinetic depth effect). A three-dimensional \u201cshadow\u201d of a hypothetical four-dimensional wire figure also has been produced; it was not seen as rigid."

                "text": "A model of visual apparent motion is derived from four observations on path selection in ambiguous displays in which apparent motion of illuminated dots could, in principle, be perceived along many possible paths: (a) Whereas motion over each path is clearly visible when its stimulus is presented in isolation, motion is usually seen over only one path when two or more such stimuli are combined (competition), (b) Path selection is nearly independent of viewing distance (scale invariance). (c) At transition points between paths (' and j (where apparent motion is equally likely to be perceived along / and j), the time t and distance d between successive points along the paths are described by a log linear d/t relationship; that is, t = A - B log (d/d,). (d) When successive elements along a path differ in orientation or size, the perceived motion along this path is not necessarily weaker than motion along a path composed entirely of identical elements. The model is a form of strength theory in which the path with greatest strength 5 becomes the dominant path. From scale invariance, we prove that the contributions of time and distance to stimulus strength are independent. From the log linear d/t relationship, we derive the precise trade-off function between d and / and show the existence of an optimal interstimulus interval to maximize the strength for any path. The model accounts well for the path-selection data and suggests a neural interpretation in which motion perception is based on the outputs of elementary detectors that are scaled replicas of each other, all having the same geometry and time delays, and differing only in size and orientation. A visual stimulus, such as a bar or a disk, which is flashed first at one position and then flashed again nearby, may evoke a powerful illusion of movement, provided the spacing and timing of the two flashes is chosen appropriately. The vividness of this apparent motion depends strongly on the spatial and temporal separation of the stimuli and only weakly on the figural similarity of one stimulus to the other (see Kolers, 1972, for a review). However, efforts by Korte (1915), Neuhaus (1930), and others to discover a"

The zero crossings of \u22072G(x, y) \u2217 I(x, y) are located, as in Marr & Hildreth (1980). That is, the image is filtered through centre-surround receptive fields, and the zero values in the output are found. In addition, the time derivative \u2202[\u22072G(x, y) \u2217 l(x, y)]/\u2202t is measured at the zero crossings, and serves to constrain the local direction of motion to within 180\u00b0. The direction of motion can be determined in a second stage, for example by combining the local constraints.

The author has analyzed the computations performed in the course of visual motion analysis. Workable schemes able to perform certain tasks performed by the visual system have been constructed and used as vehicles for investigating the problems faced by the visual system and its methods for solving them.Two major problems are treated: first, the correspondence problem, which concerns the identification of image elements that represent the same object at different times, thereby maintaining the perceptual identity of the object in motion or in change. The second problem is the three-dimensional interpretation of the changing image once a correspondence has been established.The author's computational approach to visual theory makes the work unique, and it should be of interest to psychologists working in visual perception and readers interested in cognitive studies in general, as well as computer scientists interested in machine vision, theoretical neurophysiologists, and philosophers of science."

The extent of this perceived continuity may be measured by probing the perceived spatial location at times between the target jumps, by either a vernier alignment or a stereoscopic technique. As the time between jumps increase the accuracy of spatial interpolation falls, until finally the object is seen only at its actual spatial locations. These results can be analysed in the frequency domain by treating the signal for apparent motion as the analogue of a periodic waveform containing relatively low frequencies (the continuous motion) and higher frequencies giving rise to the discreteness of the motion. If such an input has the higher frequencies progressively removed by physical filtering, it is perceived ads increasingly continuous. The fact that such filtering is not necessary for perceived continuity when the discrete jumps occur at rates greater than about 30 Hz suggests that frequencies greaster than that limit are removed by the visual system itself."

                "text": "1. We have examined the responses of simple cells in the cat's atriate cortex to visual patterns that were designed to reveal the extent to which these cells may be considered to sum light\u2010evoked influences linearly across their receptive fields. We used one\u2010dimensional luminance\u2010modulated bars and grating as stimuli; their orientation was always the same as the preferred orientation of the neurone under study. The stimuli were presented on an oscilloscope screen by a digital computer, which also accumulated neuronal responses and controlled a randomized sequence of stimulus presentations. 2. The majority of simple cells respond to sinusoidal gratings that are moving or whose contrast is modulated in time in a manner consistent with the hypothesis that they have linear spatial summation. Their responses to moving gratings of all spatial frequencies are modulated in synchrony with the passage of the gratings' bars across their receptive fields, and they do not produce unmodulated responses even at the highest spatial frequencies. Many of these cells respond to temporally modulated stationary gratings simply by changing their response amplitude sinusoidally as the spatial phase of the grating the grating is varied. Nonetheless, their behavior appears to indicate linear spatial summation, since we show in an Appendix that the absence of a 'null' phase in a visual neurone need not indicate non\u2010linear spatial summation, and further that a linear neurone lacking a 'null' phase should give responses of the form that we have observed in this type of simple cell. 3. A minority of simple cells appears to have significant non\u2010linearities of spatial summation. These neurones respond to moving gratings of high spatial frequency with a partially or totally unmodulated elevation of firing rate. They have no 'null' phases when tested with stationary gratings, and reveal their non\u2010linearity by giving responses to gratings of some spatial phases that are composed partly or wholly of even harmonics of the stimulus frequency ('on\u2010off' responses). 4. We compared simple receptive fields with their sensitivity to sinusoidal gratings of different spatial frequencies. Qualitatively, the most sensitive subregions of simple cells' receptive fields are roughly the same width as the individual bars of the gratings to which they are most sensitive. Quantitatively, their receptive field profiles measured with thin stationary lines, agree well with predicted profiles derived by Fourier synthesis of their spatial frequency tuning curves."

These insensitivities to low rates of change in space and time are not independent: a gentle gradient of illumination can be made more visible by moving it, or modulating its brightness in time. Patterns of alternating light and dark bars with a sinusoidal luminance profile across the bars\u2014sinusoidal gratings\u2014are commonly used to study spatial interactions in the visual system. Some of the earliest workers to use these stimuli noticed that human sensitivity to steady sinusoidal gratings of low spatial frequency is poor, but is markedly enhanced if the grating is moved or modulated in time1,2."

Such a counterphase grating is used as a suprathreshold masking pattern. When the mask is of low spatial frequency and is modulated rapidly, a test pattern consisting of an increment of the rightward component and an equivalent simultaneous decrement of the leftward component is highly detectable compared with simultaneous increments or decrements of both components. The visibility of the opponent-movement test signal is strongly facilitated by high-contrast masks. This facilitation is accompanied by a high sensitivity for judging the direction of motion of the test. These results show that certain detection mechanisms are highly sensitive to the difference of the rightward and leftward components. However, when the mask is of threshold contrast, the rightward- and leftward-moving test components appear to be detected independently. A high-contrast grating that rapidly moves in one direction strongly masks gratings moving in the same or opposite direction; this shows that moving patterns are not detected by unidirectional mechanisms when contrast is clearly suprathreshold. The results may be explained by a model with mechanisms that are excited by one direction of motion and inhibited by the opposite direction."

                "text": "Stroboscopic presentation of a moving object can be interpolated by our visual system into the perception of continuous motion. The precision of this interpolation process has been explored by measuring the vernier discrimination threshold for targets displayed stroboscopically at a sequence of stations. The vernier targets, moving at constant velocity, were presented either with a spatial offset or with a temporal offset or with both. The main results are: (1) vernier acuity for spatial offset is rather invariant over a wide range of velocities and separations between the stations (see Westheimer & McKee 1975); (2) vernier acuity for temporal offset depends on spatial separation and velocity. At each separation there is an optimal velocity such that the strobe interval is roughly constant at about 30 ms; optimal acuity decreases with increasing separation; (3) blur of the vernier pattern decreases acuity for spatial offsets, but improves acuity for temporal offsets (at high velocities and large separations); (4) a temporal offset exactly compensates the equivalent (at the given velocity) spatial offset only for a small separation and optimal velocity; otherwise the spatial offset dominates. A theoretical analysis of the interpolation problem suggests a computational scheme based on the assumption of constant velocity motion. This assumption reflects a constraint satisfied in normal vision over the short times and small distances normally relevant for the interpolation process. A reasonable implementation of this scheme only requires a set of independent, direction selective spatiotemporal channels, that is receptive fields with the different sizes and temporal properties revealed by psychophysical experiments.

The threshold contrast for detecting a drifting sinusoidal grating was found to be independent of the contrast of an added subthreshold grating which moved in the opposite direction. 3. The detection threshold for a counterphase flickering grating is twice that for a moving grating, suggesting that the visual system analyses a counterphase grating as the sum of two half\u2010contrast gratings which move in opposite directions. 4. Threshold for a counterphase grating may be linearly reduced by the addition of subthreshold background gratings drifting in either direction. Additivity between counterphase grating and moving background is complete. 5. After adaptation to a drifting grating, the behaviour of counterphase detection threshold as a function of the contrast of a moving subthreshold background depends upon the direction of background movement. When the background moves in a direction opposite that of the adaptation stimulus, complete linear additivity results. When the background moves in the same direction as the adapting grating, counterphase threshold is constant for low background contrasts, but drops linearly for higher background contrasts. 6. The results support the hypothesis that directionally selective channels in human vision are independent contrast detectors. Counterphase gratings are detected by one or the other of these direction\u2010specific mechanisms, whichever is momentarily the more sensitive."

The reciprocal nature of these spatio-temporal interactions can be particularly clearly ap\u00ad preciated if the threshold contrast is determined for a grating target whose luminance perpendicular to the bars is given by where m is the contrast, v the spatial frequency, and \u0192 the temporal frequency of the target.

                "text": "1. All complex cells in the cat's striate cortex exhibit gross non\u2010linearities of spatial summation when tested with sinusoidal grating stimuli. Their responses to moving gratings of all but the lowest spatial frequencies are usually dominated by a component that is not modulated by the passage of the bars of the grating across the receptive field. They give responses to temporally modulated stationary gratings that consist mostly of even harmonics of the stimulus frequency and that vary little in amplitude or wave form as the spatial phase of the grating is varied. 2. We compared complex cells' receptive fields with their sensitivity to sinusoidal gratings of different spatial frequencies. Qualitatively, the receptive fields are usually two to five times wider than the bars of the gratings that stimulate them most effectively. Quantitatively, the receptive field profiles of complex cells are invariably broader than those predicted by Fourier synthesis of their spatial frequency tuning curves, and in particular lack predicted spatially antagonistic regions. 3. We further examined the receptive field organization of these cells, using pairs of stationary lines flashed synchronously on their receptive fields. If both lines are of the same polarity (bright or dark), complex cells respond to the paired stimulus much less well than they do to either of its component bars, unless the bars are separated by less than about one quarter of the width of the receptive field. If the lines are of opposite polarity, one bright and one dark, the opposite situation obtains: closely spaced bars elicit small responses, while paired bars of larger separation are much more effective. In either case, the results are independent in general character of the absolute positions of the stimuli within the receptive field; rather, they depend in a manner characteristic of each cell on the relative positions of the two bars. 4. The two\u2010line interaction profile that plots the change in a complex cell's response to one bar as a function of the position of a second added bar corresponds closely to the receptive field profile predicted from Fourier synthesis of the cell's spatial frequency tuning curve. These profiles may thus reveal the spatial characteristics of subunits within complex cell\u2010receptive fields. We examined the nature of the interaction between these subunits by performing several two\u2010line interaction experiments in which the onset of the second bar was delayed some time after the onset of the first. The results suggest that neighbouring subunits interact in a facilitatory fashion: for an interval after the presentation of one bar, responses to neighbouring bars are enhanced. 5. The subunits of a complex receptive field may, by their spatial properties, determine the spatial selectivities of complex cells, while the nature of the interaction among the subunits may determine these cells' sensitivity and selectivity for moving visual stimuli..."

                "text": "1. We have examined the spatial and temporal tuning properties of 238 cortical neurones, recorded using conventional techniques from acutely prepared anaesthetized cats. We determined spatial and temporal frequency tuning curves using sinusoidal grating stimuli presented to each neurone's receptive field by a digital computer on a cathode ray tube. 2. We measured tuning curves either by determining response amplitude as a function of spatial or temporal frequency, or by measuring contrast sensitivity (the inverse of the contrast of the grating that just elicited a detectable response). The two measures give very similar tuning curves in all cases. 3. We recorded from 184 neurones in area 17; of these 156 had receptive fields within 5 degrees of the area centralis. The range of preferred spatial frequency for these neurones was 0.3\u2010\u20103 c/deg, and their spatial frequency tuning band widths varied from 0.7 to 3.2 octaves at half\u2010amplitude. The most common band width was roughly 1.3 octaves. Simple and complex cells in area 17 did not differ in their distributions of preferred spatial frequency, although complex cells were, on average, slightly less selective for spatial frequency than simple cells. 4. We recorded from fifty\u2010four neurones from area 18, and performed several experiments in which we recorded from corresponding portions of both area 17 and area 18 in the same electrode penetration. Neurones in area 18 preferred spatial frequencies that were, on average, one third as high as those preferred by area 17 neurones at the same retinal eccentricity. Thus the range of preferred spatial frequency in area eighteen cells having receptive fields within 5 deg of the area centralis was between less than 0.1 and 0.5 c/deg. The distributions of optimum spatial frequency in the two areas were practically non\u2010overlapping at eccentricities as high as 15 deg, the greatest eccentricity we examined. Neurones in area 18 were about as selective for spatial frequency as were neurones in area 17. 5. We determined temporal frequency tuning characteristics for some neurones from each area, using gratings that moved steadily across the screen. Neurones from area 17 all responded well to low temporal frequencies, and less well to higher frequencies (in excess of, usually, 2 or 4 Hz). In contrast, neurones recorded from area 18 sometimes had similar tuning properties, but more commonly showed a pronounced reduction in response as the temporal frequency was moved either above or below some optimum value (usually 2\u2010\u20108 Hz). 6. We conclude from these results that areas 17 and 18 act in parallel to process different aspects of the visual information relayed from the retina via the lateral geniculate complex. Some or all of the differences between the areas may be attributable to the predominance of Y cell input to area 18 and the predominance of X cell input to area 17..."

An otherwise undetectable camouflaged target form was made visible by the sequential presentation of two random-contoured patterns that were identical except for the presence of the camouflaged form in one of the patterns. Experiment 1 found that form identifications became less accurate as a function of the luminance and contours of an intervening stimulus pattern and as a function of the ISI, falling to nearly a chance level by only 30 msec. Experiment 2 illustrated contrasts in stimulus conditions and in temporal characteristics of the differentiation and the integration of sequential visual patterns. Differentiation apparently differs from integration in the following respects: (1) it requires the sequential presentation of correlated patterns, in contrast to the uncorrelated patterns that produce masking when integrated; (2) it has a maximal effect with sequential presentation at ISI=0 rather than with simultaneous presentation; and (3) it operates over a shorter range of ISI than does integration."

                "text": "In the central nervous system the visual pathway from retina to striate cortex provides an opportunity to observe and compare single unit responses at several distinct levels. Patterns of light stimuli most effective in influencing units at one level may no longer be the most effective at the next. From differences in responses at successive stages in the pathway one may hope to gain some understanding of the part each stage plays in visual perception. By shining small spots of light on the light-adapted cat retina Kuffler (1953) showed that ganglion cells have concentric receptive fields, with an 'on' centre and an 'off ' periphery, or vice versa. The 'on' and 'off' areas within a receptive field were found to be mutually antagonistic, and a spot restricted to the centre of the field was more effective than one covering the whole receptive field (Barlow, FitzHugh & Kuffler, 1957). In the freely moving lightadapted cat it was found that the great majority of cortical cells studied gave little or no response to light stimuli covering most of the animal's visual field, whereas small spots shone in a restricted retinal region often evoked brisk responses (Hubel, 1959). A moving spot of light often produced stronger responses than a stationary one, and sometimes a moving spot gave more activation for one direction than for the opposite. The present investigation, made in acute preparations, includes a study of receptive fields of cells in the cat's striate cortex. Receptive fields of the cells considered in this paper were divided into separate excitatory and inhibitory ('on' and 'off') areas. In this respect they resembled retinal ganglion-cell receptive fields. However, the shape and arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory areas differed strikingly from the concentric pattern found in retinal ganglion cells. An attempt was made to correlate responses to moving stimuli"

The technical parameters of the composite television signals in use at present are considered in relation to their transmission via frequency-modulated satellite channels at 12GHz, and a completely new transmission system (MAC, or multiplexed analogue components) is suggested. The MAC system is analysed in some detail, and shown to have many advantages over composite signals; ways in which the system could form the basis of a pan-European satellite television system are discussed. It is shown that MAC transmissions, in combination with suitable video signal processing, could eventually provide extended-definition high-quality television pictures with more efficient use of the RF spectrum than other proposed extended-definition television systems."
