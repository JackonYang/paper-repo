There are two fundamental problems associated with image processing based on such random field models. First, we want to generate realizations of the random fields to determine their suitability as models of our prior knowledge. Second, we want to collect statistics and perform optimizations associated with the random fields to solve model-based estimation problems, e.g., image restoration and segmentation. According to the Hammersley-Clifford Theorem [3], MRF's which are defined on a lattice are in one-to-one correspondence with Gibbs distributions. Starting with [4] there have been various constructions of Markov chains which possess a Gibbs invariant distribution, and whose common characteristic is that their transition probabilities depend only on the ratio of the Gibbs probabilities (and not on the normalization constant). These chains can be used via Monte Carlo simulation for sampling from Gibbs distributions at a fixed temperature, and for finding globally minimum energy states by slowly decreasing the temperature as in the simulated annealing (or stochastic relaxation) method [5], [6]. Certain types of diffusion processes which also have a Gibbs invariant distribution can be used for the same purposes when the random fields are continuous-valued [7], [8]."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

One of the key limitations of reaction-diffusion systems is that they are generally unbounded, making them awkward for digital image processing. In this paper we introduce the \"M-lattice\", a system that preserves the pattern-formation properties of reaction-diffusion and is bounded. On the theoretical front, we establish how the M-lattice is closely related to the analog Hopfield network and the cellular neural network, but has more flexibility in how its variables interact. Like many \"neurally inspired\" systems, the bounded M-lattice also enables computer or analog VLSI implementations to simulate a variety of partial and ordinary differential equations. On the practical front, we demonstrate two novel applications of reaction-diffusion formulated as the new M-lattice. These are adaptive filtering, applied to the restoration and enhancement of fingerprint images, and nonlinear programming, applied to image halftoning in both \"faithful\" and \"special effects\" styles."

Here, we consider the Markov random field formalism, a special case of the Bayesian approach, in which the probability distributions are specified by an energy function.We show that: (i) our discrete formulations for the energy function is closely related to the continuous formulation; (ii) by using the mean field (MF) theory approach, introduced by Geiger and Girosi [1991], several previous attempts to solve these energy functions are effectively equivalent; (iii) by varying the parameters of the energy functions we can obtain connections to nonlinear diffusion and minimal description length approaches to image segmentation; and (iv) simple modifications to the energy can give a direct relation to robust statistics or can encourage hysteresis and nonmaximum suppression."

In computer vision, a fundamental problem is to appropriately decompose the domain R of a function g (x,y) of two variables. This problem starts by describing the physical situation which produces images: assume that a three-dimensional world is observed by an eye or camera from some point P and that g1(rho) represents the intensity of the light in this world approaching the point sub 1 from a direction rho. If one has a lens at P focusing this light on a retina or a film-in both cases a plane domain R in which we may introduce coordinates x, y then let g(x,y) be the strength of the light signal striking R at a point with coordinates (x,y); g(x,y) is essentially the same as sub 1 (rho) -possibly after a simple transformation given by the geometry of the imaging syste. The function g(x,y) defined on the plane domain R will be called an image. What sort of function is g? The light reflected off the surfaces Si of various solid objects O sub i visible from P will strike the domain R in various open subsets R sub i. When one object O1 is partially in front of another object O2 as seen from P, but some of object O2 appears as the background to the sides of O1, then the open sets R1 and R2 will have a common boundary (the 'edge' of object O1 in the image defined on R) and one usually expects the image g(x,y) to be discontinuous along this boundary.

We start by studying the statistics of natural images including the scale invariant properties, then generic prior models were learnt to duplicate the observed statistics. The learned Gibbs distributions confirm and improve the forms of existing prior models. More interestingly inverted potentials are found to be necessary, and such potentials form patterns and enhance preferred image features. The learned model is compared with existing prior models in experiments of image restoration."

To understand the representation of images by the mammalian visual system, it might therefore be useful to consider the statistics of images from the natural environment (i.e., images with trees, rocks, bushes, etc). In this study, various coding schemes are compared in relation to how they represent the information in such natural images. The coefficients of such codes are represented by arrays of mechanisms that respond to local regions of space, spatial frequency, and orientation (Gabor-like transforms). For many classes of image, such codes will not be an efficient means of representing information. However, the results obtained with six natural images suggest that the orientation and the spatial-frequency tuning of mammalian simple cells are well suited for coding the information in such images if the goal of the code is to convert higher-order redundancy (e.g., correlation between the intensities of neighboring pixels) into first-order redundancy (i.e., the response distribution of the coefficients). Such coding produces a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio and permits information to be transmitted with only a subset of the total number of cells. These results support Barlow's theory that the goal of natural vision is to represent the information in the natural environment with minimal redundancy."

Specifically, we show that anisotropic diffusion can be seen as a robust estimation procedure that estimates a piecewise smooth image from a noisy input image. The \"edge-stopping\" function in the anisotropic diffusion equation is closely related to the error norm and influence function in the robust estimation framework. This connection leads to a new \"edge-stopping\" function based on Tukey's biweight robust estimator that preserves sharper boundaries than previous formulations and improves the automatic stopping of the diffusion. The robust statistical interpretation also provides a means for detecting the boundaries (edges) between the piecewise smooth regions in an image that has been smoothed with anisotropic diffusion. Additionally, we derive a relationship between anisotropic diffusion and regularization with line processes. Adding constraints on the spatial organization of the line processes allows us to develop new anisotropic diffusion equations that result in a qualitative improvement in the continuity of edges."

This problem is typical of ill-conditioned inverse problems that frequently arise in low-level computer vision. A conventional method to stabilize the problem is to introduce a priori constraints on X/sup 0/ and design a cost functional H(X) over images X, which is a weighted average of the prior constraints (regularization term) and posterior constraints (data term); the reconstruction is then the image X, which minimizes H. A prominent weakness in this approach, especially with quadratic-type stabilizers, is the difficulty in recovering discontinuities. The authors therefore examine prior smoothness constraints of a different form, which permit the recovery of discontinuities without introducing auxiliary variables for marking the location of jumps and suspending the constraints in their vicinity. In this sense, discontinuities are addressed implicitly rather than explicitly. >"

The restoration algorithm is a global-optimization algorithm applicable to other optimization problems. It generates iteratively a multilevel cascode of restored images corresponding to different levels of resolution, or scale.

FRAME combines attractive aspects of two important themes in texture modeling: multi-channel filtering and Markov random field (MRF) modeling. It incorporates the responses of a set of well selected filters into the distribution over a random field and hence has a much stronger descriptive ability than the traditional MRF models. Furthermore, it interprets and clarifies many previous concepts and methods for texture analysis and synthesis from a unified point of view. Algorithms are proposed for probability inference, stochastic simulation and filter selection. Experiments on a variety of textures are described to illustrate our theory and to show the performance of our algorithms. These experiments demonstrate that many textures previously considered as different categories can be modeled and synthesized in a common framework."

This principle consists of two parts. The first is the maximum entropy principle for feature binding (or fusion): for a given set of observed feature statistics, a distribution can be built to bind these feature statistics together by maximizing the entropy over all distributions that reproduce them. The second part is the minimum entropy principle for feature selection: among all plausible sets of feature statistics, we choose the set whose maximum entropy distribution has the minimum entropy. Computational and inferential issues in both parts are addressed; in particular, a feature pursuit procedure is proposed for approximately selecting the optimal set of features. The minimax entropy principle is then corrected by considering the sample variation in the observed feature statistics, and an information criterion for feature pursuit is derived. The minimax entropy principle is applied to texture modeling, where a novel Markov random field (MRF) model, called FRAME (filter, random field, and minimax entropy), is derived, and encouraging results are obtained in experiments on a variety of texture images. The relationship between our theory and the mechanisms of neural computation is also discussed."

Reaction-diffusion is a process in which two or more chemicals diffuse at unequal rates over a surface and react with one another to form stable patterns such as spots and stripes. Biologists and mathematicians have explored the patterns made by several reaction-diffusion systems. We extend the range of textures that have previously been generated by using a cascade of multiple reaction-diffusion systems in which one system lays down an initial pattern and then one or more later systems refine the pattern. Examples of patterns generated by such a cascade process include the clusters of spots on leopards known as rosettes and the web-like patterns found on giraffes. In addition, this paper introduces a method which reaction-diffusion textures are created to match the geometry of an arbitrary polyhedral surface. This is accomplished by creating a mesh over a given surface and then simulating the reaction-diffusion process directly on this mesh. This avoids the often difficult task of assigning texture coordinates to a complex surface. A mesh is generated by evenly distributing points over the model using relaxation and then determining which points are adjacent by constructing their Voronoi regions. Textures are rendered directly from the mesh by using a weighted sum of mesh values to compute surface color at a given position. Such textures can also be used as bump maps."

The latter is a test of efficiency. Here, we explore a code modeled on the simple cells of the primate striate cortex. The Cortex transform maps a digital image into a set of subimages (layers) that are bandpass in spatial frequency and orientation. The layers are sampled so as to minimize the number of samples and still avoid aliasing. Samples are quantized in a manner that exploits the bandpass contrast-masking properties of human vision. The entropy of the samples is computed to provide a lower bound on the code size. Finally, the image is reconstructed from the code. We devise psychophysical methods for comparing the original and reconstructed images to evaluate the sufficiency of the code. When each resolution is coded at the threshold for detection artifacts, the image-code size is about 1 bit/pixel."

The classic snakes/balloons and region growing algorithms can be directly derived from our approach. We provide theoretical analysis of region competition including accuracy of boundary location, criteria for initial conditions, and the relationship to edge detection using filters. It is straightforward to generalize the algorithm to multiband segmentation and we demonstrate it on gray level images, color images and texture images. The novel color model allows us to eliminate intensity gradients and shadows, thereby obtaining segmentation based on the albedos of objects. It also helps detect highlight regions."

The theoretical lower limit for the joint entropy, or uncertainty, of these variables is achieved by an optimal 2D filter family whose spatial weighting functions are generated by exponentiated bivariate second-order polynomials with complex coefficients, the elliptic generalization of the one-dimensional elementary functions proposed in Gabor's famous theory of communication [J. Inst. Electr. Eng. 93, 429 (1946)]. The set includes filters with various orientation bandwidths, spatial-frequency bandwidths, and spatial dimensions, favoring the extraction of various kinds of information from an image. Each such filter occupies an irreducible quantal volume (corresponding to an independent datum) in a four-dimensional information hyperspace whose axes are interpretable as 2D visual space, orientation, and spatial frequency, and thus such a filter set could subserve an optimally efficient sampling of these variables. Evidence is presented that the 2D receptive-field profiles of simple cells in mammalian visual cortex are well described by members of this optimal 2D filter family, and thus such visual neurons could be said to optimize the general uncertainty relations for joint 2D-spatial-2D-spectral information resolution. The variety of their receptive-field dimensions and orientation and spatial-frequency bandwidths, and the correlations among these, reveal several underlying constraints, particularly in width/length aspect ratio and principal axis organization, suggesting a polar division of labor in occupying the quantal volumes of information hyperspace.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Learning as approximation and learning as hypersurface reconstruction are discussed. Two extensions of the regularization approach are presented, along with the approach's corrections to splines, regularization, Bayes formulation, and clustering.

We adapt reaction-diffusion system to the needs of computer graphics by presenting a method to synthesize patterns which compensate for the effects of non-uniform surface parameterization.

                "text": "It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns onHydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis.The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading."

                "text": "The paper describes a model of competition that explains the formation of the ocular dominance stripes found in layer IVc of cat and monkey visual cortex. The main proposal is that synapses exert effects on the growth of other synapses, and that these effects extend over distances of at least 600 \u03bcm and vary in magnitude and sign within this distance. Interactions between like type synapses are assumed to be stimulating for distances up to about 200 \u03bcm, and inhibitory for distances of 200-600 \u03bcm. The reverse is true of interactions between synapses of opposite eye type, where the effects are inhibitory for distances up to about 200 \u03bcm and stimulating for longer ones. The interactions are assumed to be circularly symmetric. Growth of, for example, right eye synapses at one point will therefore (a) encourage local growth of right eye synapses and inhibit local growth of left eye synapses and (b) encourage growth of left eye synapses and inhibit growth of right eye synapses in an annular ring surrounding the point of initial increase. At the start of development, right and left eye synapses are assumed to be intermixed randomly within layer IVc. Computer simulations show that a wide variety of conditions incorporating these assumptions will lead to the formation of stripe patterns. These reproduce many of the morphological features of monkey ocular dominance stripes, including Y- and \u041d-type branches and terminations, the tendency for stripes to run at right angles into the boundaries of the pattern, and to narrow at branch points. The model can explain the effects of monocular deprivation on stripe morphology if it is assumed that the effectiveness of deprived eye synapses in determining rates of growth locally is reduced. The existence of a critical period for these effects can be explained if it is assumed that lateral growth of terminals does not occur, and that some factor such as a limited availability of postsynaptic sites decreases the rate of growth of synapses as their density approaches a maximum. The model can be generalized to account for pattern formation in other systems, such as zebra or mackerel skin, where similar striped patterns occur. In this context, the simplest model based on diffusion that will produce a pattern of stripes requires that one cell type should secrete two substances, one of which stimulates growth or differentiation of its parent cell type and has a low rate of diffusion or is rapidly inactivated, and another that inhibits growth or differentiation and either has a higher rate of diffusion or is less rapidly inactivated. A preliminary account of some of these results has appeared elsewhere (Swindale 1979)."

By simply iterating the transform upon which a \u039e-filter is based without changing the size of the convolution kernel, the cutoff frequency may be varied. Use of \u039e-filters is analyzed and demonstrated as applied to ultrahigh-speed image processing using table-lookup computation."
