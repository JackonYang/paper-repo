                "text": "A neural network model for naming visual objects and their attributes, and understanding certain simple types of sentences has been presented. The model is based on neural processes rather than linguistic or symbolic constructs. The following are the major structural features of the model: 1. Memory stores are associative networks that perform an analysis of their inputs in real time. This analysis converts the input pattern into a \"recognition pattern\" that depends on the specific stored information and its location in the store. 2. The naming store is an analyzer network that converts the sensory encoding of a sentence into a \"sentence pattern\". The sentence pattern is obtained by averaging the recognition signals from several memory locations in the naming store. Because of the organization of words in the naming store, sentence patterns are an encoding of the structure of the sentences. 3. The sentence store is an associative memory store that recognizes sentence patterns and associates with each one an \"instruction sequence\" or \"program\" that specifies how the system should respond to the sentence. It is the enabling of access to this \"program\" that constitutes \"understanding.\" Sentences are understood in real time, without the explicit grammatical analysis that is usual in sentence-understanding systems. Understanding a sentence involves two functionally distinct processes: (1) associating with its sentence pattern an instruction sequence that specifices what to do in order to generate an appropriate response to the sentence matching that pattern: for example, to look in the visual field for an object, determine its location, and so on, and (2) analysis of the tokens in the sentence that indicate specific attributes or entities to look for or determine."

                "text": "An introduction is given to a theory of early visual information processing. The theory has been implemented, and examples are given of images at various stages of analysis. It is argued that the first step of consequence is to compute a primitive but rich description of the grey-level changes present in an image. The description is expressed in a vocabulary of kinds of intensity change (EDGE, SHADING-EDGE, EXTENDED-EDGE, LINE, BLOB etc.). Modifying parameters are bound to the elements in the description, specifying their POSITION, ORIENTATION, TERMINATION points, CONTRAST, SIZE and FUZZINESS. This description is obtained from the intensity array by fixed techniques, and it is called the primal sketch. For most images, the primal sketch is large and unwieldy. The second important step in visual information processing is to group its contents in a way that is appropriate for later recognition. From our ability to interpret drawings with little semantic content, one may infer the presence in our perceptual equipment of symbolic processes that can define \"place-tokens\" in an image in various ways, and can group them according to certain rules. Homomorphic techniques fail to account for many of these grouping phenomena, whose explanations require mechanisms of construction rather than mechanisms of detection. The necessary grouping of elements in the primal sketch may be achieved by a mechanism that has available the processes inferred from above, together with the ability to select items by first order discriminations acting on the elements' parameters. Only occasionally do these mechanisms use downward-flowing information about the contents of the particular image being processed. It is argued that \"non-attentive\" vision is in practice implemented by these grouping operations and first order discriminations acting on the primal sketch. The class of computations so obtained differs slightly from the class of second order operations on the intensity array. The extraction of a form from the primal sketch using these techniques amounts to the separation of figure from ground. It is concluded that most of the separation can be carried out by using techniques that do not depend upon the particular image in question. Therefore, figure-ground separation can normally precede the description of the shape of the extracted form. Up to this point, higher-level knowledge and purpose are brought to bear on only a few of the decisions taken during the processing. This relegates the widespread use of downward-flowing information to a later stage than is found in current machine-vision programs, and implies that such knowledge should influence the control of, rather than interfering with, the actual data-processing that is taking place lower down."

In contrast, when people are presented with the task of locating one unfamiliar face among a collection of similar faces, or of determining whether an upside-down face or one presented in photographic negative is similar to a given face, or of determining whether two faces depict the same person seen from different points of view (front or profile), then processing is sequential and is based on locating and comparing features rather than processing the entire face as a Gestalt image. We will first consider the instantaneous recognition process relating to familiar faces, and defer until later a discussion of face recognition tasks that use sequential processes. Most computer programs for face recognition are based on locating and measuring selected facial features which are then compared with corresponding measurements of known faces. Examples of the types of measurements used are ratios of distances between eye corners and mouth; ratio of height of face to width of face; and lines and angles of points along the face profile. Althoug.h these processes resemble the sequential face recognition processes used by people when performing complex face recognition tasks, they do not appear to be related to the instantaneous processes that people use when recognizing familiar faces. One question that immediately comes to mind is: are there any computational techniques that can instantaneously distinguish between different faces? The answer is yes. Preston (1965) reported that instantaneous recognition of human faces was carried out successfully using an optical computer."

What patterns are stored in the sensory buffer elements? What is the nature of the retinal input pattern to each sensory buffer element, and what is the nature of the test pattern? Finally, what is the origin of the test pattern? Although there are no definitive answers to these questions, we will suggest answers that are based on experimental and psychological evidence as well as information processing considerations. The primary visual cortex is organized into columnar processing elements that receive inputs from the retina via the lateral geniculate bodies. These inputs, which arrive at the primary visual cortex in layers IVc, as well as I, IVa, and possibly VI, convey information about the nature of the retinal images in a relatively small region, including (but not exclusively) color, texture, and brightness information. These local primary patterns are immediately transformed by the cortical connections to a more complex representation of the visual field in layers II, III, V, and VI. Although there are numerous ways to represent visual information, our ability to choose which component we wish to attend suggests that a representation is used that enhances the selection processes. For example, we can look for an object with a specific color or texture, at a specific distance, or one which is moving. Marr (Marr, 1976; Marr & Poggio, 1977) calls this representation a primal sketch, but the question still remains, what is the nature of the transformation from retina to cortex and beyond? One transformation, which appears to be particularly likely is the Hueckel (1971) transform, which is the product of radial and angular spatial Fourier transformations, but other transformations are also likely."

                "text": "Of the many possible functions of the macaque monkey primary visual cortex (striate cortex, area 17) two are now fairly well understood. First, the incoming information from the lateral geniculate bodies is rearranged so that most cells in the striate cortex respond to specifically oriented line segments, and, second, information originating from the two eyes converges upon single cells. The rearrangement and convergence do not take place immediately, however: in layer IVc, where the bulk of the afferents terminate, virtually all cells have fields with circular symmetry and are strictly monocular, driven from the left eye or from the right, but not both; at subsequent stages, in layers above and below IVc, most cells show orientation specificity, and about half are binocular. In a binocular cell the receptive fields in the two eyes are on corresponding regions in the two retinas and are identical in structure, but one eye is usually more effective than the other in influencing the cell; all shades of ocular dominance are seen. These two functions are strongly reflected in the architecture of the cortex, in that cells with common physiological properties are grouped together in vertically organized systems of columns. In an ocular dominance column all cells respond preferentially to the same eye. By four independent anatomical methods it has been shown that these columns have the form of vertically disposed alternating left-eye and right-eye slabs, which in horizontal section form alternating stripes about 400 \u03bcm thick, with occasional bifurcations and blind endings. Cells of like orientation specificity are known from physiological recordings to be similarly grouped in much narrower vertical sheeet-like aggregations, stacked in orderly sequences so that on traversing the cortex tangentially one normally encounters a succession of small shifts in orientation, clockwise or counterclockwise; a 1 mm traverse is usually accompanied by one or several full rotations through 180\u00b0, broken at times by reversals in direction of rotation and occasionally by large abrupt shifts. A full complement of columns, of either type, left-plus-right eye or a complete 180\u00b0 sequence, is termed a hypercolumn. Columns (and hence hypercolumns) have roughly the same width throughout the binocular part of the cortex. The two independent systems of hypercolumns are engrafted upon the well known topographic representation of the visual field. The receptive fields mapped in a vertical penetration through cortex show a scatter in position roughly equal to the average size of the fields themselves, and the area thus covered, the aggregate receptive field, increases with distance from the fovea. A parallel increase is seen in reciprocal magnification (the number of degrees of visual field corresponding to 1 mm of cortex). Over most or all of the striate cortex a movement of 1-2 mm, traversing several hypercolumns, is accompanied by a movement through the visual field about equal in size to the local aggregate receptive field. Thus any 1-2 mm block of cortex contains roughly the machinery needed to subserve an aggregate receptive field. In the cortex the fall-off in detail with which the visual field is analysed, as one moves out from the foveal area, is accompanied not by a reduction in thickness of layers, as is found in the retina, but by a reduction in the area of cortex (and hence the number of columnar units) devoted to a given amount of visual field: unlike the retina, the striate cortex is virtually uniform morphologically but varies in magnification. In most respects the above description fits the newborn monkey just as well as the adult, suggesting that area 17 is largely genetically programmed. The ocular dominance columns, however, are not fully developed at birth, since the geniculate terminals belonging to one eye occupy layer IVc throughout its length, segregating out into separate columns only after about the first 6 weeks, whether or not the animal has visual experience. If one eye is sutured closed during this early period the columns belonging to that eye become shrunken and their companions correspondingly expanded. This would seem to be at least in part the result of interference with normal maturation, though sprouting and retraction of axon terminals are not excluded."

                "text": "intellectual activity may be largely preserved In lesions oCthefeft temporal region. However, the patient with a disturbance of the phonemic and conceptual structure of the speech processes always experiences considerable difficulty notwithstanding the adequate preservation of the ability to engage in certain forms of abstract intellectual activity, when he attempts to carry out systematic, successive operations with relationships requiring the constant participation of speech associations as mediators. In such circumstances the ability to discriminate between relationships becomes manifestly inadequate and the patient'S intellectual operations begin to suffer. The intellectual defects of a patient with temporal aphasia become apparent in nonspeech operations in which an essential part of the process entails the use of systems of speech associations retained in the memory. For instance, a patient who could still sort out a series of pictures telling a story, provided he was allowed to mix them up himself, found the process very difficult if he was not allowed to touch the pictures and was asked to put them in the proper order as indicated by the appropriate numbers (Ombredane, 1951). These patients experience similar difficulties with series of geometrical operations. The defects were found to be particularly serious when such patients attempted to do mental arithmetical calculations. They had no difficulty in grasping numerical relationships but, although usually preserving the general plan of the necessary actions, they became helpless when given problems requiring a series of successive operations with some of the results to be kept in mind. An attempt to assist the process by allowing them to speak out loud was unsuccessful, and without the support of a well-established and differentiated system of word associations it was seriously impaired. It should be noted that the operations of discursive intellectual activity, which are wholly dependent on speech, for example, the solution of logical problems as in Burt's tests on the establishment of multiple relationships (Part III, Section 8E), remained completely beyond these patients' ability. They \u2022 Among our patients was a bookkeeper with a severe form of sensory aphasia who could still draw up the annual balance sheet in spite of severe disturbances of speech and although he was unable to remember the names of his subordinates and used to refer to them incorrectly."

Automatic processing is activation of a learned sequence of elements in long-term memory that is initiated by appropriate inputs and then proceeds automatically\u2014without subject control, without stressing the capacity limitations of the system, and without necessarily demanding attention. Controlled processing is a temporary activation of a sequence of elements that can be set up quickly and easily but requires attention, is capacity-limited (usually serial in nature), and is controlled by the subject. A series of studies using both reaction time and accuracy measures is presented, which traces these concepts in the form of automatic detection and controlled, search through the areas of detection, search, and attention. Results in these areas are shown to arise from common mechanisms. Automatic detection is shown to develop following consistent mapping of stimuli to responses over trials. Controlled search is utilized in varied-mapping paradigms, and in our studies, it takes the form of serial, terminating search. The approach resolves a number of apparent conflicts in the literature."

Each picture was later divided into 64 squares, and 20 other Ss judged their recognizability on a 10-point scale. Both measures gave high readings for unusual details and for unpredictable contours. Although they were judged to be highly recognizable, all the redundant (or predictable) contours received few fixations. Areas of mere texture scored low on both measures. The relations between fixation densities and estimated recognizability suggest that a scene may be divided into informative features and redundant regions. Not only do the eyes have to be aimed, they are usually aimed intelligently, even during the casual inspection of pictures."
