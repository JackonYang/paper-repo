We show that the method leads to markedly improved segmentation results and can deal with significant variation in shape and varying backgrounds. We discuss the relative merits of class-specific and general image-based segmentation methods and suggest how they can be usefully combined."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

In this paper, we consider priors from unitary generative models, partially labeled data and spatial attention. These priors are modelled as constraints in the solution space. By imposing uniformity condition on the constraints, we restrict the feasible space to one of smooth solutions. A subspace projection method is developed to solve this constrained eigenproblem. We demonstrate that simple priors can greatly improve image segmentation results."

Natural images contain both textured and untextured regions, so the cues of contour and texture differences are exploited simultaneously. Contours are treated in the intervening contour framework, while texture is analyzed using textons. Each of these cues has a domain of applicability, so to facilitate cue combination we introduce a gating operator based on the texturedness of the neighborhood at a pixel. Having obtained a local measure of how likely two nearby pixels are to belong to the same region, we use the spectral graph theoretic framework of normalized cuts to find partitions of the image into regions of coherent texture and brightness. Experimental results on a wide range of images are shown."

The feature of interest, an eye for example, is described by a parameterized template. An energy function is defined which links edges, peaks, and valleys in the image intensity to corresponding properties of the template. The template then interacts dynamically with the image by altering its parameter values to minimize the energy function, thereby deforming itself to find the best fit. The final parametr values can be used as descriptors for the feature. We illustrate this method by showing deformable templates detecting eyes and mouths in real images. We demonstrate their ability for tracking features."

Unlike previous theories, our model is derived from a single assumption: that the prior probability distribution of boundary completion shape can be modeled by a random walk in a lattice whose points are positions and orientations in the image plane (i.e., the space that one can reasonably assume is represented by neurons of the mammalian visual cortex). Our model does not employ numerical relaxation or other explicit minimization, but instead relies on the fact that the probability that a particle following a random walk will pass through a given position and orientation on a path joining two boundary fragments can be computed directly as the product of two vector-field convolutions. We show that for the random walk we define, the maximum likelihood paths are curves of least energy, that is, on average, random walks follow paths commonly assumed to model the shape of illusory contours. A computer model is demonstrated on numerous illusory contour stimuli from the literature."

In particular it is concerned with understanding, specifying and learning prior models of varying strength and applying them to dynamic contours. Its aim is to develop and analyse these modelling tools in depth and within a consistent framework."
