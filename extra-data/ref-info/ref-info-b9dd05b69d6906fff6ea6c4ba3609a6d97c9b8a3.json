                "text": "Abstract The concept of conditional experimental frames of reference has a significance for the general theory of statistical inference which has been emphasized by R. A. Fisher, D. R. Cox, J. W. Tukey, and others. This concept is formulated as a principle of conditionality, from which some general consequences are deduced mathematically. These include the likelihood principle, which has not hitherto been very widely accepted, in contrast with the conditionality concept which many statisticians are inclined to accept for purposes of \u201cinformative inference.\u201d The likelihood principle states that the \u201cevidential meaning\u201d of experimental results is characterized fully by the likelihood function, without other reference to the structure of an experiment, in contrast with standard methods in which significance and confidence levels are based on the complete experimental model. The principal writers supporting the likelihood principle have been Fisher and G. A. Barnard, in addition to Bayesian writers for whom i..."
