This method involves examining a predetermined space or language of possible concept descriptions, finding those which are consistent with the observed training instances. Rather than use heuristic search techniques to examine this concept description space, the subspace (version space) of all plausible concept descriptions is represented and updated with each training instance. This version space approach determines all concept descriptions consistent with the training instances, without backtracking to reexamine past training instances or previously rejected concept descriptions. Proofs are given for the correctness of the method for representing version spaces, and of the associated concept learning algorithm, for any countably infinite concept description language. Empirical results obtained from computer implementations in two domains are presented. The version space approach has been implemented as one component of the Meta-DENDRAL program for learning production rules in the domain of chemical spectroscopy. Its implementation in this program is described in detail."

The algorithm put forth uses a representation of the space of those rules consistent with the observed training data. This \"rule version space\" is modified in response to new training instances by eliminating candidate rule versions found to conflict with each new instance.

In examples three \"blocks world\" operators are learned from six before-and-after pairs and also from a sequence of fifteen blocks world situations.

It then attempts to discover all the ways the relations of this minimal set can interact with each other, thus generating a set of inference rules. Although the system was originally designed to explore automatic techniques for theory construction for question-answering systems, it is currently being expanded to function as a symbiotic system to help social scientists explore certain kinds of data bases."

Patterns to be recognized are defined by templates consisting of a set of predicate calculus relations. Productions are representable by associating actions with templates. A network for recognizing occurrences of any of the template patterns in data may be automatically compiled. The compiled network is economical in the sense that conjunctive products (subsets) of relations common to several templates are represented in and computed by the network only once. The recognition network operates in a bottom-up fashion, in which all possibilities for pattern matches are evaluated simultaneously. The distribution of the recognition process throughout the network means that it can readily be decomposed into parallel processes for use on a multiprocessor machine. The method is expected to be especially useful in errorful domains (e.g., vision, speech) where parallel treatment of alternative hypotheses is desired. The network is illustrated with an example from the current syntax and semantics module in the Hearsay II speech understanding system."

It divides the field into four cor~ topics (embodying the base fo\u00b7r a science of intelligence) and eight applications topics (in which research has been contributing to core ideas).. The paper discusses the history, the major landmarks, and some of the controversies in each of these twelve topics. Each topic is represented by a chart citing the major references. These references are contained in an extensive bibliography. The paper concludes with a discussion of some of the criticisms of 'AI and with some predictions about the course of future research."

First published in 1956 and hailed at its appearance as a groundbreaking study, it is still read three decades later as a major contribution to our understanding of the mind. In their insightful new introduction, the authors relate the book to the cognitive revolution and its handmaiden, artificial intelligence."
