Scene analysis programs have been awkward to develop using conventional programming systems because of the difficulty of formulating pictorial descriptions in symbolic terms. Picture processing techniques are inherently ad hoc and must be deduced empirically for each application. We have constructed an interactive system specifically designed for expressing and experimenting with perceptual strategies. The system allows an experimenter to describe basic perceptual concepts to a computer in terms of pictorial examples. The examples are designated graphically by encircling areas of a displayed scene with a cursor. A concept is represented internally by values of primitive feature-extraction operators that distinguish it from examples of previously defined concepts. Concepts so defined constitute a common vocabulary, shared by man and machine, that can be used symbolically in describing objects and specifying scene analysis procedures. The system bas been used to formulate interactively descriptions that distinguish objects in indoor room scenes and programs that locate these objects in images."

                "text": "The papers presented in this volume were contributed by participants in \nthe U.S.-Japan Seminar on Fuzzy Sets and Their Applications, held at the \nUniversity of California, Berkeley, in July 1974. These papers cover a broad \nspectrum of topics related to the theory of fuzzy sets, ranging from its mathematical aspects to applications in human cognition, communication, decisionmaking, and engineering systems analysis. Basically, a fuzzy set is a class in which there may be a continuum of grades of membership as, say, in the class of long objects. Such sets underlie much of our ability to summarize, communicate, and make decisions under uncertainty or partial information. Indeed, fuzzy sets appear to play an essential role in human cognition, especially in relation to concept formation, pattern classification, and logical reasoning. \nSince its inception about a decade ago, the theory of fuzzy sets has evolved in many directions, and is finding pplications in a wide variety of fields in which the phenomena under study are too complex or too ill defined to be analyzed by conventional techniques. Thus, by providing a basis for a systematic approach to approximate reasoning, the theory of fuzzy sets may well have a substantial impact on scientific methodology in the years ahead, particularly in the realms of psychology, economics, law, medicine, decision analysis, information retrieval, and artificial intelligence. \nThe U.S.-Japan Seminar on Fuzzy Sets was sponsored by the U.S.-Japan Cooperative Science Program, with the joint support of the National Science Foundation and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. In organizing the seminar, the co-chairmen received considerable help from J.E. O\u2019Connell and L. Trent of the National Science Foundation; the staff of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; and D. J. Angelakos and his staff at the University of California, Berkeley. As co-editors of this volume, we wish also to express our heartfelt appreciation to Terry Brown for her invaluable assistance in the preparation of the manuscript, and to Academic Press for undertaking its publication. \nFor the convenience of the reader, a brief introduction to the theory of fuzzy sets is provided in the Appendix of the first paper in this volume. An up-to-date bibliography on fuzzy sets and their applications is included at the \nend of the volume."
