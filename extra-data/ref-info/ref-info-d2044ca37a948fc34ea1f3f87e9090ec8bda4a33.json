                "text": "The study of computerized correction of spelling errors has a relatively long history and remains of considerable current interest if regularly appearing papers on the topic are any gauge. Whereas early papers focused on the correction of output from optical character recognition (OCR), voice recognition, Morse code, or on spelling errors in program code, the application of most interest today is probably the correction of machine-readable text. Also, the techniques involved in spelling error correction have other important applications, for example, measuring the similarity of two strings of symbols to determine the evolutionary distance of proteins. The specialized subtopics are covered extensively in recent bibliographies by Peterson [7] and Pollock [8] and are not discussed further here. The most suitable correction strategy for text often depends on both its nature and its source. Correcting source code for a procedural language with a smafl vocabulary of short words (e.g., a typical programming language or the command language for a bibliographic search system) presents quite different problems than scientific text. Similarly, OCR output contains almost exclusively substitution errors, which ordinarily account for less than 20 percent of keyboarded misspellings [9, 10]. This paper describes the correction pro.gram developed as part of SPEEDCOP (Spelling Error. Detection/ \u00a91984ACM0001-0782/84/0400-0358 75\u00a2 Correction Project), a Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) project supported by the National Science Foundation. The program is intended not as a theoretical construct but as a useful tool for text editing. Under SPEEDCOP, approximately 25,000,000 words from seven scientific and scholarly textual databases were processed to extract over 50,000 misspellings using a dictionary equivalent to 40,000 words. This contrasts sharply with most work on spelling correction that tends to feature small dictionaries and either few or artificial misspellings. In our case, the use of real data gave credibility to the proposed solution, whereas the large dictionary revealed problems such as ambiguity that would not otherwise have been discovered. Internal reports [10-13] and papers [9, 19] describe in considerable detail how the misspellings were gathered and analyzed. The core of the SPEEDCOP program is an algorithm for correcting only isolated misspellings that contain a single error and whose correct forms are in a dictionary. This is not as drastic a restriction as it may seem as 90-95 percent of misspellings in raw keyboarding typically contain only one error [9, 10]. The SPEEDCOP program also incorporates a common misspelling dictionary and a function word routine and is therefore not rigidly restricted to the above class of misspellings. In practice, the program corrected 85-95 percent of the misspellings for which it was designed, 75-90 percent of those whose corresponding words were in the dic-"

The probability scores are the novel contribution of this work. They are based on a noisy channel model. It is assumed that the typist knows what words he or she wants to type but some noise is added on the way to the keyboard (in the form of typos and spelling errors). Using a classic Bayesian argument of the kind that is popular in recognition applications, especially speech recognition (Jelinek, 1985), one can often recover the intended correction,c, from a typo,t, by finding the correctionc that maximizesPr(c) Pr(t/c). The first factor,Pr(c), is a prior model of word probabilities; the second factor,Pr(t/c), is a model of the noisy channel that accounts for spelling transformations on letter sequences (insertions, deletions, substitutions and reversals). Both sets of probabilities were estimated using data collected from the Associated Press (AP) newswire over 1988 and 1989 as a training set. The AP generates about 1 million words and 500 typos per week.In evaluating the program, we found that human judges were extremely reluctant to cast a vote given only the information available to the program, and that they were much more comfortable when they could see a concordance line or two. The second half of this paper discusses some very simple methods of modeling the context usingn-gram statistics. Althoughn-gram methods are much too simple (compared with much more sophisticated methods used in artificial intelligence and natural language processing), we have found that even these very simple methods illustrate some very interesting estimation problems that will almost certainly come up when we consider more sophisticated models of contexts. The problem is how to estimate the probability of a context that we have not seen. We compare several estimation techniques and find that some are useless. Fortunately, we have found that the Good-Turing method provides an estimate of contextual probabilities that produces a significant improvement in program performance. Context is helpful in this application, but only if it is estimated very carefully.At this point, we have a number of different knowledge sources\u2014the prior, the channel and the context\u2014and there will certainly be more in the future. In general, performance will be improved as more and more knowledge sources are added to the system, as long as each additional knowledge source provides some new (independent) information. As we shall see, it is important to think more carefully about combination rules, especially when there are a large number of different knowledge sources."

However, a great deal of natural language text (for example, memos, messages, rough drafts, conversation transcripts, etc.) have features that differ significantly from \"neat\" texts, posing special problems for readers, such as misspelled words, missing words, poor syntactic construction, unclear or ambiguous interpretation, missing crucial punctuation, etc. Our solution to these problems is to make use of expectations, based both on knowledge of surface English and on world knowledge of the situation being described. These syntactic and semantic expectations can be used to figure out unknown words from context, constrain the possible word senses of words with multiple meanings (ambiguity), fill in missing words (ellipsis), and resolve referents (anaphora). This method of using expectations to aid the understanding of \"scruffy\" texts has been incorporated into a working computer program called NOMAD, which understands scruffy texts in the domain of Navy ship-to-shore messages."

In this paper, we demonstrate how spelling errors can be efficiently handled from an algorithmic, computer science point of view. We first show that the various types of spelling errors must receive different treatments, and we especially focus on phonographic errors, on which relatively little work has been done. We provide some quantitative data on the phonographic structure of language and develop a mathematical framework for modeling the various types of errors, including phonographic ones. Finally, we outline an application to fast retrieval of misspelt words in dictionaries, which can be implemented in natural-language interfaces to make computers interact more gracefully with non-specialists."

The parser is an extension of the well-known Tomita algorithm (Tomita, 1986). The parser interacts with the spelling corrector and handles certain types of structural errors. Both modules have been integrated with a compound analyzer and a dictionary of 275,000 word forms into a program for stand-alone proof-reading of Dutch texts on a large scale. The system is in its final testing phase and will be commercially available as from 1992."

The experiments have used n-gram matching, non-phonetic coding and dynamic programming methods for spelling correction, and have demonstrated that high-recall searches can be carried out, although some of the searches are very demanding of computational resources. The methods are, in principle, applicable to historical texts in many languages and from many diffeent periods."

The probability scores are the novel contribution of this work. Probabilities are based on a noisy channel model. It is assumed that the typist knows what words he or she wants to type but some noise is added on the way to the keyboard (in the form of typos and spelling errors). Using a classic Bayesian argument of the kind that is popular in the speech recognition literature (Jelinek, 1985), one can often recover the intended correction, c, from a typo, t, by finding the correction c that maximizes Pr(c) Pr(t/c). The first factor, Pr(c), is a prior model of word probabilities; the second factor, Pr(t/c), is a model of the noisy channel that accounts for spelling transformations on letter sequences (e.g., insertions, delections, substitutions and reversals). Both sets of probabilities were trained on data collected from the Associated Press (AP) newswire. This text is ideally suited for this purpose since it contains a large number of typos (about two thousand per month)."

                "text": "Natural languages are full of collocations, arbitrary and recurrent combinations of words that co-occur more often than chance. Such combinations correspond to arbitrary word usages and are termed collocations. Recent work in lexicography indicates that collocations are pervasive in English; apparently, they are common in all types of writing, including both technical and non-technical genres. \nIn the dissertation, we describe a set of techniques for retrieving and identifying collocations from large textual corpora. These techniques are based on statistical methods, and identify a wide range of collocations. A statistical filtering technique is described for identifying word pairs involved in a syntactic relation. The words can appear in any order and can be separated by an arbitrary number of other words. Another technique describes how n word collocations (or n-grams) can be identified in a simpler and cheaper way than other methods. The techniques also feature an original method for syntactically labeling and filtering collocations. These techniques have been implemented in a lexicographic tool, Xtract that automatically acquires collocations. Xtract identifies collocations of arbitrary length as well as more flexible collocations. The techniques are described and some results are presented on a 10 million word corpus of stock market news reports. A lexicographic evaluation of Xtract as a collocation retrieval tool estimated the precision of Xtract to be 80%. The evaluation is presented in the dissertation. \nAs a performance task, we demonstrate how such collocations enhance the task of lexical selection in language generation. Previous language generation works were not able to account for co-occurrence knowledge for two principal reasons. They did not have the compiled information and the lexicon formalisms available were not able to properly handle collocational knowledge. The knowledge problem is handled with the use of lexicographic tools such as Xtract, and the representation problem is handled with Functional Unification Grammars (FUGs). We show how the use of FUGs allows to properly handle the interactions of collocational and various other constraints. \nFinally, we consider several other applications of our work such as computer assisted lexicography, information retrieval, machine translation and spelling correction."

The resulting static trigram language model (STLM) has fixed probabilities that are independent of the document being dictated. To improve the language model (LM), one can adapt the probabilities of the trigram language model to match the current document more closely. The partially dictated document provides significant clues about what words are more likely to be used next. Of many methods that can be used to adapt the LM, we describe in this paper a simple model based on the trigram frequencies estimated from the partially dictated document. We call this model a cache trigram language model (CTLM) since we are caching the recent history of words. We have found that the CTLM reduces the perplexity of a dictated document by 23%. The error rate of a 20,000-word isolated word recognizer decreases by about 5% at the beginning of a document and by about 24% after a few hundred words."

This paper proposes a method for representing some context information so that the correct meaning for a word in a sentence can be selected. The approach is primarily based on work by Waltz and Pollack (1985, 1984), who emphasized neutrally plausible systems. By contrast this paper focuses on computationally feasible methods applicable to full-scale natural language processing systems. There are two key elements: a collection of context vectors defined for every word used by a natural language processing system, and a context algorithm that computes a dynamic context vector at any position in a body of text. Once the dynamic context vector has been computed it is easy to choose among competing meanings for a word. This choice of definitions is essentially a neural network computation, and neural network learning algorithms should be able to improve such choices. Although context vectors do not represent all context information, their use should improve those full-scale systems that have avoided context as being too difficult to deal with. Good candidates for full-scale context vector implementations are machine translation systems and Japanese word processors. A main goal of this paper is to encourage such large-scale implementations and tests of context vector approaches. A variety of interesting directions for research in natural language processing and machine learning will be possible once a full set of context vectors has been created. In particular the development of more powerful context algorithms will be an important topic for future research."

Some methods have also been devised for the treatment of input that is almost well-formed. Nevertheless, it is still quite easy to stray over the bounds imposed by current natural language systems. Without proper diagnosis, this leads to interactive systems that are not habitable, i.e. systems that are not able to perform up to the user's expectations. \nThis thesis presents an overall system for the treatment of several areas normally outside the limits of natural language systems, and for the diagnosis of any input. The system, Robust Sentence Analysis, includes procedures for handling ambiguous input, resolving input with anaphors (e.g. pronouns), making several kinds of major and minor corrections to input, and the interactions of all these areas. The system does not treat every aspect of these methods of human interaction, but does provide for the more prevalent forms as found in simulations of user interaction in several modes: face-to-face, terminal-to-terminal, and human-to-computer (using a previously implemented natural language system). Thus the system incorporates the most likely forms found in human performance. Diagnostics are designed to lead the user back into the boundaries of the system. \nThe Robust Sentence Analysis system is implemented as a part of the ASK system, A Simple Knowledgeable System."

For example, most optical character recognition [OCR] machines are limited to a few fonts of machine print, or text that is handprinted under certain constraints; any deviation from these constraints will produce highly garbled text. This paper describes an algorithm for text recognition/correction that effectively merges a bottom-up refinement process that is based on the utilization of transitional probabilities and letter confusion probabilities, known as the Viterbi algorithm [VA], together with a top-down process based on searching a trie structure representation of a lexicon. The algorithm is applicable to text containing an arbitrary number of character substitution errors such as that produced by OCR machines."

If appropriate care is taken, we find that it is possible to make useful estimates of contextual probabilities that improve performance in a spelling correction application. In contrast, less careful estimates are found to be useless. Specifically, we will show that the Good-Turing method makes the use of contextual information practical for a spelling corrector, while attempts to use the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) or expected likelihood estimator (ELE) fail. Spelling correction was selected as an application domain because it is analogous to many important recognition applications based on a noisy channel model (such as speech recognition), though somewhat simpler and therefore possibly more amenable to detailed statistical analysis."

Various algorithms utilizing context are considered, from a dictionary algorithm which has available the maximum amount of information, to a set of contextual algorithms utilizing positional binary n-gram statistics. The latter information differs from the usual n-gram letter statistics in that the probabilities are position-dependent and each is quantized to 1 or 0, depending upon whether or not it is nonzero. This type of information is extremely compact and the computation for error correction is orders of magnitude less than that required by the dictionary algorithm."

We described a tool, Xtract, that implements these methods and able to retrieve a wide range of collocations in a two stage process. These methods as well as other related methods however have some limitations. Mainly, the produced collocations do not include any kind of functional information and many of them are invalid. In this paper we introduce methods that address these issues. These methods are implemented in an added third stage to Xtract that examines the set of collocations retrieved during the previous two stages to both filter out a number of invalid collocations and add useful syntactic information to the retained ones. By combining parsing and statistical techniques the addition of this third stage has raised the overall precision level of Xtract from 40% to 80% with a precision of 94%. In the paper we describe the methods and the evaluation experiments."

Error messages which provide good diagnostic information are generated automatically. Error correction is done by discarding some input symbols and popping up some symbols from the parsing\u2010stack in order to restore the parser to a valid configuration. Thus, symbol deletions and insertions are simulated. The choice between different possible corrections is made by comparing the cost of the inserted (popped) symbols with the reliability value of the recovery symbol (the first input symbol that is not discarded). Our concept of reliability is based on the observation that input symbols differ from each other in their ability to serve as recovery points. A high reliability value of a symbol asserts that it was probably not placed in the input by accident. So it is reasonable not to discard that symbol but to resume parsing. This is done even if a string with high insert\u2010cost has to be inserted before that symbol in order to fit it to the part of the program that has already been analysed. The error recovery routine is invoked only when an error is detected. Thus, there is no additional time required for parsing correct programs. Error\u2010correcting parsers for different languages, including Pascal, have been generated. Some experimental results are summarized."

This study of natural \ndialogue was undertaken to reveal those characteristics \nwhich can make computer English more \nnatural. Experiments were made in three modes \nof communication: face-to-face, terminal-to-terminal \nand human-to-computer, involving over \n80 subjects, over 80,000 words and over 50 \nhours. They showed some striking similarities, \nespecially in sentence length and proportion of \nwords in sentences. The three modes also share \nthe use of fragments, typical of dialogue. \nDetailed statistical analysis and comparisons \nare given. The nature and relative frequency of \nfragments, which have been classified into \ntwelve categories, is shown in all modes. Special \ncharacteristics of the face-to-face mode \nare due largely to these fragments (which \ninclude phatics employed to keep the channel of \ncommunication open). Special characteristics of \nthe computational mode include other fragments, \nnamely definitions, which are absent from other \nmodes. Inclusion of fragments in computational \ngrammar is considered a major factor in improving \ncomputer naturalness. \n \nThe majority of experiments involved a real \nlife task of loading Navy cargo ships. The \npeculiarities of face-to-face mode were similar \nin this task to results of earlier experiments \ninvolving another task. It was found that in \ntask oriented situations the syntax of interactions \nis influenced in all modes by this context \nin the direction of simplification, resulting in \nshort sentences (about 7 words long). Users \nseek to maximize efficiency In solving the problem. \nWhen given a chance, in the computational \nmode, to utilize special devices facilitating \nthe solution of the problem, they all resort to \nthem. \n \nAnalyses of the special characteristics of \nthe computational mode, including the analysis \nof the subjects\" errors, provide guidance for \nthe improvement of the habitability of such systems. \nThe availability of the REL System, a \nhigh performance natural language system, made \nthe experiments possible and meaningful. The \nindicated improvements in habitability are now \nbeing embodied in the POL (Problem Oriented \nLanguage) System, a successor to REL."

Tests of network performance on a transfer set yielded a very low error rate. In a second study, a network was trained to identify words from expert transcriptions of speech. On a transfer test, error rate for correct simultaneous identification of words and word boundaries was 18%. The third study used the output of a phoneme classifier as the input to the word and word boundary identification network. The error rate on a transfer test set was 49% for this task.

Misspellings are highlighted by a standard spelling checker; syntactic errors are detected and corrections are suggested; and stylistic infelicities are called to the user's attention.Central to the EPISTLE processing strategy is its technique of fitted parsing. When the rules of a conventional syntactic grammar are unable to produce a parse for an input string, this technique can be used to produce a reasonable approximate parse that can serve as input to the remaining stages of processing.This paper first describes the fitting process and gives examples of ill-formed language situations where it is called into play. We then show how a fitted parse allows EPISTLE to carry on its text-critiquing mission where conventional grammars would fail either because of input problems or because of limitations in the grammars themselves. Some inherent difficulties of the fitting technique are also discussed. In addition, we explore how style critiquing relates to the handling of ill-formed input, and how a fitted parse can be used in style checking."

Specifically, the problem is to estimate the probability that a given word will be the next word uttered. Algorithms are presented for automatically constructing a binary decision tree designed to estimate these probabilities. At each node of the tree there is a yes/no question relating to the words already spoken, and at each leaf there is a probability distribution over the allowable vocabulary. Ideally, these nodal questions can take the form of arbitrarily complex Boolean expressions, but computationally cheaper alternatives are also discussed. Some results obtained on a 5000-word vocabulary with a tree designed to predict the next word spoken from the preceding 20 words are included. The tree is compared to an equivalent trigram model and shown to be superior. >"

Systems must be able to partially understand, or at least give specific, appropriate error messages, when input does not correspond to their model of language and of context.We propose meta-rules and a control structure under which they are invoked as a framework for processing ill-formed input. The left-hand side of a meta-rule diagnoses a problem as a violated rule of normal processing. The right-hand side relaxes the violated rule and states how processing may be resumed, if at all.Examples discussed in the paper include violated grammatical tests, omitted articles, homonyms, spelling/typographical errors, unknown words, violated selection restrictions, personification, and metonymy. An implementation of a meta-rule processor within the framework of an augmented transition network parser is also described."

Improvements included use of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) statistical classifier to identify the likely linguistic provenance of a surname, and application of language-specific rules to generate plausible spelling variations of names. These two components were incorporated into a prototype front-end system driving existing name search procedures. HMM models and sets of linguistic rules were constructed for Farsi, Spanish and Vietnamese surnames and tested on a database of over 11,000 entries. Preliminary evaluation indicates improved retrieval of 20--30% as measured by number of correct items retrieved."

The design and implementation of this system is described and illustrated with detailed examples of the operation of system components and examples of overall system operation. The language processing portion of the system uses a number of augmented transition networks, each of which matches phrases with a specific meaning, along with context registers (history keepers) and concept case frames; these are used for judging meaningfulness of questions, generating dialogue for clarifying partially understood questions, and resolving ellipsis and pronoun reference problems. Other system components construct a formal query for the relational database, and optimize the order of searching relations. Methods are discussed for handling vague or complex questions and for providing browsing ability. Also included are discussions of important issues in programming natural language systems for limited domains, and the relationship of this system to others."

The Bell Laboratories Text-toSpeech system, TTS, takes a radical dictionarybased approach; dictionary methods (with morphological and analogical extensions) are used for the vast majority of words. Only a fraction of a percent (0.5% of words overall; 0.1% of lowercase words) are left for letter-to-sound rules. Moving to an extreme dictionary-based approach cuts the error rate by at least an order of magnitude. Now that the dictionary is the rule and not the exception, the term \u2018\u2018exceptions dictionary\u2019\u2019 seems somewhat dated."

The modified algorithm uses aheuristic to limit the search through a directed graph or trellis. The effectiveness of the algorithm is investigated via exhaustive experimentation on an input of machine-printed text. The algorithm assumes language to be a Markov chain and uses transition probabilities between characters. The results empirically answer the long-standing question of what is the benefit, if any, of using transition probabilities that depend on the length of a word and their position in it."

The theory is based on past studies of how people read that show there are two steps of visual processing in reading and that these steps are influenced by cognitive processes. This paper discusses the development of a similar set of algorithms. A gross visual description of a word is used to suggest a set of hypotheses about its identity. These then drive further selective analysis of the image that can be altered by knowledge of language characteristics such as syntax. This is not a character recognition algorithm since an explicit segmentation of a word and a recognition of its isolated characters is avoided. This paper presents a unified discussion of this methodology with a concentration on the second stage of selective image analysis. An algorithm is presented that determines the minimum number of tests that have to be programmed under the constraint that the minimum number of tests are to be executed. This is used to compare the proposed technique to a similar character recognition algorithm."

Chapter 1 is a glossary of terms and a classification of typing errors intended to be used as a standard nomenclature for future work. Chapter 2 is an overview of studies of typing and a brief review of the computer simulation model of skilled typing. Chapter 3 compares skilled and novice performance in discontinuous typing. Chapter 4 discusses keystroke timing in transcription typing, and Chapter 5 discusses error patterns in skilled and novice transcription typing. In general, the studies use a variety of methods, including computer simulation, stop-frame video analysis, studies of interkeystroke interval distributions, and analysis or error patterns. Subjects ranged from novice typists (taking a high school typing class) to expert and super typists: typing speeds studied ranged from 12 wpm to 112 wpm. The studies help explore the influence of motor schemas and preplanning in the learning and performance of highly skilled motor activities, examine the row of overlapping, parallel motor activity, analyze the significant differences in typing styles, even among typists of equivalent ability, and lead us towards better understanding of the cognitive control systems for complex motor tasks."

They can involve two, three or more words, these words can be of different syntactic categories and they can be involved in more or less rigid ways. This leads to two main difficulties: collocational knowledge has to be acquired and it must be represented flexibly so that it can be used for language generation. We address both problems in this paper, focusing on the acquisition problem. We describe a program, Xtract, that automatically acquires a range of collocations from large textual corpora and we describe how they can be represented in a flexible lexicon using a unification based formalism."

The system combines several techniques in order to improve the overall recognition rate. Thinning and shape extraction are performed directly on a graph of the run-length encoding of a binary image. The resulting strokes and other shapes are mapped, using a shape-clustering approach, into binary features which are then fed into a statistical Bayesian classifier. Large-scale trials have shown better than 97 percent top choice correct performance on mixtures of six dissimilar fonts, and over 99 percent on most single fonts, over a range of point sizes. Certain remaining confusion classes are disambiguated through contour analysis, and characters suspected of being merged are broken and reclassified. Finally, layout and linguistic context are applied. The results are illustrated by sample pages."

                "text": "Many examples of ill-formedness that people routinely and easily correct can be resolved by a natural language system only if it makes use of knowledge of the pragmatic context. This investigation centers around examples of alias errors, where the ill-formedness is due to a single word that is incorrect but still lexically understood, as with the substitution of on for in in the phrase stay on good shape. Localizing and resolving such errors frequently depends on pragmatic knowledge. This thesis presents a model for pragmatic context within expert advising dialogues, where an agent who is building a plan to solve a problem consults with a domain expert, and develops methods for applying that model to resolving ill-formed input. \nMetaplans are used to model the structure of the agent's problem-solving behavior, both the gradual refinement of the domain plans being considered and the connection between them and the queries motivated by them. The partially-specified domain plans that the agent is considering are represented by nodes in a plan classification hierarchy, and these classes of domain plans in turn serve as arguments to the problem-solving metaplans. The expansion and search of the metaplan tree that models the problem-solving context is governed by heuristics based both on its metaplan structure and on a model of the agent's world knowledge. This model can be used to track the problem-solving moves implicit in a sequence of well-formed queries and also to predict likely moves and queries as determined by the context which can then be linked to the partial interpretation of an ill-formed query suggesting corrections for the ill-formedness. \nThis approach has been implemented in a system called Pragma, which suggests corrections based on pragmatic context for alias errors in naval domain queries, using techniques that could also be extended to other classes of ill-formedness and to generating cooperative responses. Pragma demonstrates that a model capturing the pragmatic structure of a particular discourse setting can be used to increase the robustness of a natural language interface."

Developing an effectiveecologyrequires access to large amounts of textual and lexical data. A number of projects are currently underway in the United States, in Europe, and in Japan to provide such materials in a form that allows them to be shared as community resources. This paper first briefly reviews a number of these efforts. Then it presents the results of a Workshop on Open Lexical and Textual Resources that was convened to discuss the value of amassing such collections. Consideration is subsequently given to types of corpora and procedures for designing and analyzing them. Three projects are singled out for special mention: (1) theText Encoding Initiative, which is formulating and disseminating guidelines for the preparation and dissemination of machine-readable texts for research and for use by the language industries; (2) theData Collection Initiative, which is acquiring and preparing a large text corpus to be made available for scientific research at cost and without royalties; and (3) theConsortium for Lexical Research, which is collecting and disseminating lexical resources and providing a clearinghouse for research results that make use of them. Understanding theecology of languageand analyzing the resources that contribute to it will prove increasingly important for electronic document delivery."

The methods found are classified as either equivalence or similarity problems. Equivalence problems are seen to be readily solved using canonical forms. For sinuiarity problems difference measures are surveyed, with a full description of the wellestablmhed dynamic programming method relating this to the approach using probabilities and likelihoods. Searches for approximate matches in large sets using a difference function are seen to be an open problem still, though several promising ideas have been suggested. Approximate matching (error correction) during parsing is briefly reviewed."

This is clearly not satisfactory in the absence of a good measure of average power in each class. Thornton and Staley [8] have attempted something similar by using Grosch's Law but the applicability of Grosch's Law itself is being questioned (cf. [1]). To find a solution, the problem must be approached in another way. In measuring the level of computerization, what is really of interest is how much information is being processed by computers. Often scientific computing is not of concern although it may be consuming significant computing power. Therefore a good measure of level of information processing is the amount of information stored in computer readable form. This information could be on cards, tapes, disks or whatever. However, it has already been said that disks are the preferred storage medium of present computers and other mediums like tapes are being used more and more for backup and long-term storage only. It is expected that disks will play an even more dominant role as an I /O medium in the future. This is confirmed by analysis of prices presented in Phister [6, Section 2.12]. It seems therefore that the level of information processing or computerization may be measured in a satisfactory way by the total direct access storage capacity. Number of bits of information stored on-line per person could perhaps be used as the measure of computerization o f a country like GNP per capita is used for the economic welfare of a country. G. K.

Performance limits of such systems are defined by the robustness of the character templates and the ability of the system to segment characters. Published performance figures, however, are typically based on pre-segmented characters. Six experiments are reported (using a total of 128 subjects) that tested a state-of-the-art recognition system under more realistic conditions. Variables investigated include display format (grid, lined, and blank), surface texture, feedback (location and time delay), amount of training, practice, and effects of use over an extended period. Results indicated that novice users writing on a lined display (the most preferred format) averaged 57% recognition performance. By giving subjects continuous feedback of results, training, and after about 10 minutes of use, the system averaged 90.6% character recognition. Following three hours of interrupted use and with performance incentives, subjects achieved an average 96.8% accuracy with the system. Future work should focus on improving the ability of the recognition algorithm to segment characters and on developing non-obtrusive interaction techniques to train users, to provide feedback and to correct mis-recognized characters."

According to the model context aids the perception of target letters as they are processed in the perceptual system. The implication that the duration and timing of the context in which a letter occurs should greatly influence the perceptibility of the target is confirmed by a series of experiments demonstrating that early or enhanced presentations of word and pronounceablepseudoword contexts greatly increase the perceptibility of target letters. Also according to the model, letters in strings that share several letters with words should be equally perceptible whether they are orthographically regular and pronounceable (SLET) or irregular (SLNT) and should be much more perceptible than letters in contexts that share few letters with any word (XLQJ). This prediction is tested and confirmed. The basic results of all the experiments are accounted for, with some modification of parameters, although there are some discrepancies in detail. Several recent findings that seem to challenge the model are considered and a number of extensions are proposed."

The main advantages of trie memory over the other memoIw plans just mentioned are shorter access time, greater ease of addition or up-dating, greater convenience in handling arguments of diverse lengths, and the ability to take advantage of redundancies in the information stored. The main disadvantage is relative inefficiency in using storage space, but this inefficiency is not great when the store is large. In this paper several paradigms of trie memory are described and compared with other memory paradigms, their advantages and disadvantages are examined in detail, and applications are discussed. Many essential features of trie memory were mentioned by de la Briandais [1] in a paper presented to the Western Joint Computer Conference in 1959. The present development is essentially independent of his, having been described in memorandum form in January 1959 [2], and it is fuller in that it considers additional paradigms (finitedimensional trie memories) and includes experimental results bearing on the efficiency of utilization of storage space."

The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents (\u201csemantic structure\u201d) in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising."

The algorithm consists of constructing a finite state pattern matching machine from the keywords and then using the pattern matching machine to process the text string in a single pass. Construction of the pattern matching machine takes time proportional to the sum of the lengths of the keywords. The number of state transitions made by the pattern matching machine in processing the text string is independent of the number of keywords. The algorithm has been used to improve the speed of a library bibliographic search program by a factor of 5 to 10."

In the present paper, it is shown that if the operations on symbols of the strings are restricted to tests of equality, then O(nm) operations are necessary (and sufficient) to compute the distance."

In spite of this method's popularity, virtually nothing is known about its saturation/capacity and, in more general terms, about its performance as an associative memory. The authors address these issues using associative database retrieval as an original application domain. Experimental results show that the quality of recall and the network capacity are very significantly affected by the network topology (the number of hidden units), data representation (encoding), and the choice of learning parameters. On the basis of their results and the fact that back-propagation learning is not recursive, the authors conclude that back-propagation networks can be used mainly as read-only associative memories and represent a poor choice for read-and-write associative memories.<<ETX>>"

A split tree is a binary search tree each node of which contains two key values\u2014a <italic>node</italic> value which is a maximally frequent key in that subtree, and a <italic>split</italic> value which partitions the remaining keys (with respect to their lexical ordering) between the left and right subtrees. A <italic>median</italic> split tree (MST) uses the lexical median of a node's descendents as its split value to force the search tree to be perfectly balanced, achieving both a space efficient representation of the tree and high search speed. Unlike frequency ordered binary search trees, the cost of a successful search of an MST is log <italic>n</italic> bounded and very stable around minimal values. Further, an MST can be built for a given key ordering and set of frequencies in time <italic>n</italic> log <italic>n</italic>, as opposed to <italic>n</italic><supscrpt>2</supscrpt> for an optimum binary search tree.

One of the most common activities that can be computer assisted is the generation of text. People who cannot accurately control their extremities (due to disabilities such as cerebral palsy and spinal cord injury) use computers as writing tools. People whose physical disability restricts their spoken output may use a computer as a communication prosthesis. In both cases, the generation of text is a necessary activity that can be physically demanding. It should be made as easy for the user as possible. While the standard computer keyboard is an efficient interface for able-bodied people and some disabled people, it may present significant access problems for others. In these cases some alternative interface is necessary."

Two types of \"preference\", declarative and procedural, are distinguished. The PS framework is examined with respect to notions of well- and ill-formedness, and two criteria for ill-formedness are distinguished, both of which are possessed by PS: an absolute criterion that corresponds to conventional notions of well- and ill-formedness, and a relative criterion that does not.Four possible strategies are described for representing ill-formed input in general, and metaphors in particular. The strategies and the semantic representations produced by them are compared regarding their correspondence to human understanding (admittedly superficial given the shallowness of the PS representation) and their ability to produce correct sentence translations. We conclude that, because of the ambiguity of many individual and extended metaphors, two broad types of metaphor representation strategy are needed. A control mechanism is described that uses both these major types of strategy and that permits the temporary semantic representation of metaphorical ambiguity."

Analytic results for the noise performance of neural classifiers that can store several prototypes in one class are presented.

The repeater station includes a continuously operating transmitter, the keying of which is controlled by a local oscillator. Each of the remote stations includes a similar transmitter which is normally quiescent, but which is energized for local modulation and transmission by a push-to-talk button. Each cycle of the repeater station oscillator is modified by pulses received from a remote transmitting station, to reduce or increase the period as needed to produce identical periods and synchronization in each oscillator. The pulses received at the repeater station are not perceptible during its own transmission and hence, no control is then exerted. Hence, an equilibrium condition is immediately established at the repeater station in which the departure from coincidence of transmitted and received pulses at the repeater station is proportioned to its need for control. The transmissions from the repeater station are received by the remote stations not then transmitting. Intelligent modulation of the pulse period at these receiving remote stations is then evident and may be recovered."
