The PLP-RPS front-end is compared with standard linear predictive-cepstral metric (LP-CEP) front-end, and with LP-RPS and PLP-CEP front-ends. The two-spectral-peak models are the most efficient in modeling of linguistic information in speech. Consequently, in speaker-independent ASR, high analysis order front-ends are less effective than low-order front-ends. Synthetic speech is used for front-end evaluation. Some of perceptual inconsistencies of standard LP front-ends are alleviated in PLP front-ends. The PLP-RPS front-end is most sensitive to harmonic structure of speech spectrum. Perceptual experiments indicate similar tendencies in human auditory perception."

Four psychoacoustic factors are considered in PLP analysis, namely critical-band, masking effect, equal-loudness and intensity-loudness law. This paper presents experimental results aimed at illustrating the relative importance of each of these in the context of ASR. It is shown that the (J) SRU filter bank can be incorporated into the PLP process with very similar overall results. The ASR system is based on dynamic time warping (DTW), and a vocabulary consisting of the alphabet and zero-through-nine is used for tests."

This paper presents a novel approach to improve the accuracy in the estimation of the voiced speech production model based on the LP method. The presented method uses interpolation between spectral points which are least influenced by artifacts in the spectral analysis and by noise in the signal. We show, on analyses of both synthetic and natural speech, that the averaged parabolic approximation between harmonic peaks of voiced speech spectrum reduces the sensitivity of the LP analysis to changes in the fundamental frequency Fo and to noise. The method is well suited for combination with the Spectral Transform LP method, previously proposed by the authors [1]."

Those experiments evaluated the effect of spectral model order, in automatic speech recognition (ASR), using a small alpha\u2010numeric data base. PLP (perceptually based linear predictive) and LP (linear predictive) analyses were compared, using a cepstral and RPS (root power sums) metric. Those experiments dealing with a bigger data base were validated (104 words, ten speakers). PLP RPS front end is compared with about ten other ASR front ends (LP ceptrum, LP RPS, critical band,\u2026). Experiments were run at various different analysis model orders. Results of speaker\u2010dependent ASR show that the low\u2010dimensional PLP analysis is a good alternative to high\u2010dimensional LP or filter bank analysis. The index\u2010weighted metric improves the recognition accuracy, making the recognition results more uniform across the speakers. The speaker\u2010independent experiments (which use the templates of one male and one female speaker as references) confirm the superior performance of the PLP method for extracting speaker\u2010independent information. Most of the errors are on the consonants; some improvements on the recognition process are being investigated."

The method allows for arbitrary spectral shaping in the frequency domain, and for modeling of continuous as well as discrete spectra (such as filter bank spectra). In addition, using the method of selective linear, prediction, all-pole modeling is applied to selected portions of the spectrum, with applications to speech recognition and speech compression. LP is compared with traditional analysis-by-synthesis (AbS) techniques for spectral modeling. It is found that linear prediction offers computational advantages over AbS, as well as better modeling properties if the variations of the signal spectrum from the desired spectral model are large. For relatively smooth spectra and for filter bank spectra, AbS is judged to give better results. Finally, a sub-optimal solution to the problem of all-zero modeling using LP is given."

A model is described that generates such patterns for steady-state vowels. In addition to the nonlinear transformations underlying the loudness density and pitch scales, it incorporates experimentally established characteristics associated with frequency resolution and masking, such as the critical band concept. This model is combined with a measure of auditory perceptual distance which, operating on pairs of vowels, treats each stimulus representation as a single spectral shape. In order to test the distance metric and the model, experimental data were gathered from listeners' numerical estimates of quality differences between stimulus pairs which compared four-formant and two-formant vowels. The correlation between experimental and theoretical results was 0.89. We interpret this value to indicate that the present definition of auditory cue and auditory distance can be said to account for the experimental behavior of our listeners only in a rather gross fashion. On the other hand, the theory was developed on the basis of rather conservative assumptions about the nature of auditory cues. For instance, the model ignores the possibility of temporal coding and certain nonlinear effects, and it does not pay special attention to spectral peaks. Seen in that light, the agreement between observed and predicted auditory distance is remarkably good."

ICASSP, 1278\u20131281 (1982)] with Itakura distances between steady\u2010state synthetic reference vowels (/ae/ and /a/) and a set of acoustic variants of each vowel (approximating Klatt's stimulus sets). Despite the documented utility of the Itakura measure for speech recognition, correlations between the phonetic similarity measures and Itakura distances were very low (0.20 and 0.02 for /ae/ and /a/, respectively). Significant differences in rank across the two measures were observed for acoustic variants incorporating spectral tilt, low\u2010pass filtering and changes in F3. A second experiment measured Itakura distances and phonemic identification judgments for 21 acoustic variants of each often English reference vowels. For six reference vowels, at least one variant was identified as phonemically distinct from its reference: these phonemically distinct variants yielded smaller Itakura distances than 48% of those variants judged not phonemically distinct from the reference. These results quantify and corroborate the well\u2010known lack of optimality of the Itakura distance measure for speech recognition and may contribute to the design of more appropriate distance metrics."

An iterative algorithm for DAP modeling that is shown to converge to a unique global minimum is presented. Results of applying DAP modeling to real and synthetic speech are also presented.

These data can be used to evaluate a spectral distance metric. For example, distance calculations based on the sum-of-squares of differences in critical-band filter bank outputs and those based on the linear-prediction residual correlate poorly with the vowel distance-judgement data. On the other hand, a metric based on spectral slope differences near the peaks in the critical-band spectra to be compared can be made to correlate very well (0.93) with the perceptual data."

The equal-loudness contours are of considerable importance in this field, being fundamental to a proper understanding of aural judgments of the loudness of sounds of all kinds. They are also concerned in numerous practical applications in the study of noise. The first set of contours for free-field conditions was given by Fletcher and Munson in 1933, and a second determination was carried out by Churcher and King in 1937, but these two investigations showed considerable discrepancies over parts of the auditory diagram. The present work has been carried out on a more extensive scale, using a large team of otologically normal persons, and new techniques have been introduced enabling reliable measurements to be made over a wider range of intensity than has hitherto been possible. The new results cover a range of frequency of from 25 to 15 000 c/s and of sound pressure level up to about 130 dB relative to 0.000 2 dyn/cm2. The data show a greater degree of regularity than the former results, and allow the equivalent loudness of a pure tone of any frequency to be expressed by formulae quadratic in the sound pressure level, the coefficients varying smoothly with frequency. The results include a new determination of the normal threshold of hearing in free field, which is highly consistent with the equal-loudness contours. At frequencies above 1000 c/s account needs to be taken of variations due to the age of the observers, which become of particular importance at the upper end of the frequency range. The new results have indicated the causes of some of the discordant features in the earlier determinations and it is hoped that the work will facilitate agreement on a standard set of equal-loudness contours. On account of its relevance to noise measurement, some extension to equal-loudness relations for bands of noise is being undertaken."

It is shown that place of articulation information in the steady states, transitions, and bursts of F2 (or sometimes F3) can be reinterpreted to be information from the front cavity resonance. Furthermore, a number of synthesis results that have appeared anomalous when described in terms of numbered formants seem to find a coherent explanation in terms of the front cavity resonance.

They note a previous result that peaks found by perceptually based linear predictive (PLP) analysis closely track the F2'. The authors recall P. Mermelstein's (1967) observation of the relative invariance of the front cavity shape and size in vowels synthesized to maintain a constant F-pattern under variations of the vocal tract length. They show by tracing X-rays that humans with radically different vocal tract lengths tend to preserve the front cavity shape and size when producing vowels with identical phonetic values. Articulatory synthesis with variable vocal tract lengths is used to demonstrate that the F2' from the PLP model follows the resonance frequency of the front cavity.<<ETX>>"

Recognition results were obtained for two recognition methods: dynamic timewarping of vector codes and hidden Markov modeling. The experiments were carried out on a vocabulary of the ten digits and the word \"oh\". Two kinds of spectral analysis were considered: LPC, and a recently proposed, low dimensional, perceptually based representation (PLP). The effects of analysis order and varying degrees of quantization in the spectral representation were also considered. Recognition experiments indicate that the performance of the weighted cepstral distance with vector quantized spectral data is considerably different from that previously reported for unquantized data. Comparison of recognition rates shows wide variations due to interaction of the distance measure with the analysis technique and with vector quantization. The best recognition scores were obtained by the combination of weighted cepstral distance and low order PLP analysis. This combination maintained good recognition rates down to very low (16 or 8 codes) codebook sizes."

Although each of these sets provides equivalent information about the linear predictor, their properties under quantization are different. The results of a comparative study of the various parameter sets are reported. Specifically it is concluded that the reflection coefficients are the best set for use as transmission parameters. A more detailed investigation of the reflection coefficients is then carried out using a spectral sensitivity measure. A method of optimally quantizing the reflection coefficients is derived using a minimax spectral error criterion and the sensitivity analysis. The method consists of transforming the reflection coefficients to the so-called log area ratios and linearly quantizing them. A qualitative study on changes in pole locations due to quantization serves to corroborate the use of this optimal quantization. An optimal bit allocation strategy for the transmission parameters is also presented. The use of another spectral sensitivity measure renders logarithms of the ratios of normalized errors associated with linear predictors of successive orders as the optimal quantization parameters. Informal listening tests indicate that the use of log area ratios for quantization leads to better synthesis than the use of log error ratios."

Four formant frequency sets were formed by adding m Bark (m = 0,1,2,3) to the original formant frequencies for each vowel. The results are the following: (1) perceived vowel height articulation shifts upward when the F0 shifts upward, while all formant frequencies remain the same: (2) this shift in vowel height is more distinct amid mid and low vowels than for high vowels; and (3) vowel height does not change when the F0 as well as all formant frequencies are shifted upward the same amount along the Bark scale.

A procedure for generating vocal tract shapes from such formant frequencies yielded shapes which correspond to humanly realizable vowels and yet which are markedly different shapes. Three pairs of vowels synthesized with these formant frequencies were judged by listeners to be auditorily as different as the pair [i\u2010e] which is phonemically contrastive in many languages.

Scaling between movements of the tongue \u0394x (range of a few centimeters) and of the vocal\u2010tract constriction \u0394Lf (range of about 10 cm) is represented by an articulatory amplification factor \u03b1: \u0394Lf = \u03b1\u0394x. If x is a tongue\u2010surface coordinate parallel to the tract axis, then 1/F2\u2032 = k + 4\u03b1x/c, where k is a constant and c is the speed of sound. When x is the x coordinate of a tongue\u2010dorsum pellet tracked by x\u2010ray microbeam, the correlations between 1/F2\u2032 and x are 0.74 and 0.75 for two speakers' triple repetitions of /wiw\u0279ju\u0259ji\u0279/.

The sensitivity of PLP to Fo seems to be in principle consistent with human hearing. Recent perceptual experiments (Hermansky, 1987b; Hirahara, 1988) indicate that the perceived formant peak is shifted towards the nearest harmonic peak. Figure 10 shows the results of one of the perceptual experiments (Hermansky, 1987b). Each curve shows how different two synthetic vowel-like sounds with fixed F o were perceived to be as the difference between their second formants F 2 increased. This perceptual experiment is a replication of Flanagan's (1955) experiments aimed at finding just noticeable differences of formant frequencies."

The group-delay measure (quefrency-weighted measure, index-weighted cepstral measure, root-power-sum easure) is implemented by weighting cepstral coefficients of the all-pole PLP model spectrum in the Euclidean distance by a triangular lifter. The cepstral coefficients are computed recursively from autoregressive coefficients of the all-pole model (see, e.g., Vishwanathan and Makhoul, 1975 ). The triangular liftering (the index weighting of cepstral coefficients) is equivalent o computing a frequency derivative of the cepstrally smoothed phase spectrum (Yegnanarayana and Reddy, 1979). Consequently, the spectral peaks of the model are enhanced and its spectral slope is suppressed (Yegnanarayana, 1977). For a minimum-phase model (such as the PLP all-pole model) computing the Euclidean distance between index-weighted cepstral coefficients of two models is equivalent o evaluating the Euclidean distance between the frequency derivatives of the cepstrally smoothed power spectra of the models. Thus the group-delay distortion measure is closely related to the spectral slope measure proposed by Klatt (1982) for evaluating critical-band spectra."
