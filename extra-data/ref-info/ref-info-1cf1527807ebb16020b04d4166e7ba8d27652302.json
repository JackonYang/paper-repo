We introduce a simplified model of a deformable object class and derive the optimal detector for this model.

A cousin of the optimal detector is developed which uses \u201csoft\u201d part detectors with a probabilistic description of the spatial arrangement of the parts. Spatial arrangements are modeled probabilistically using shape statistics to achieve invariance to translation, rotation, and scaling. Improved recognition performance over methods based on \u201chard\u201d part detectors is demonstrated for the problem of face detection in cluttered scenes."

This paper describes an approach for generating such starting points automatically given no prior knowledge of the pose of the target(s) in the image. It relies upon choosing a suitable set of features, candidates for which can be found in the image. Hypotheses are formed from sets of candidates, and their plausibility tested using the statistics of their relative positions and orientations. The most plausible are used as the initial position of an Active Shape Model, which can then accurately locate the target object. The approach is demonstrated for two different image interpretation problems."

The dynamic link architecture exploits correlations in the fine-scale temporal structure of cellular signals to group neurons dynamically into higher-order entities. These entities represent a rich structure and can code for high-level objects. To demonstrate the capabilities of the dynamic link architecture, a program was implemented that can recognize human faces and other objects from video images. Memorized objects are represented by sparse graphs, whose vertices are labeled by a multiresolution description in terms of a local power spectrum, and whose edges are labeled by geometrical distance vectors. Object recognition can be formulated as elastic graph matching, which is performed here by stochastic optimization of a matching cost function. The implementation on a transputer network achieved recognition of human faces and office objects from gray-level camera images. The performance of the program is evaluated by a statistical analysis of recognition results from a portrait gallery comprising images of 87 persons. >"

We divide detection into visual selection and final classification, concentrating on the former: drastically reducing the number of candidate regions that require further, usually more intensive, processing, but with a minimum of computation and missed detections. Bottom-up processing is based on local groupings of edge fragments constrained by loose geometrical relationships. They have no a priori semantic or geometric interpretation. The role of training is to select special groupings that are moderately likely at certain places on the object but rare in the background. We show that the statistics in both populations are stable. The candidate regions are those that contain global arrangements of several local groupings. Whereas our model was not conceived to explain brain functions, it does cohere with evidence about the functions of neurons in V1 and V2, such as responses to coarse or incomplete patterns (e.g., illusory contours) and to scale and translation invariance in IT. Finally, the algorithm is applied to face and symbol detection."

The AAM contains a statistical, photo-realistic model of the shape and grey-level appearance of faces. This paper demonstrates the use of the AAM's efficient iterative matching scheme for image interpretation. We use the AAM as a basis for face recognition, obtain good results for difficult images. We show how the AAM framework allows identity information to be decoupled from other variation, allowing evidence of identity to be integrated over a sequence. The AAM approach makes optimal use of the evidence from either a single image or image sequence. Since we derive a complete description of a given image our method can be used as the basis for a range of face image interpretation tasks."

The effects of translation, rotation, and scale are eliminated by mapping to a set of shape variables. The constellations are then ranked according to the likelihood that the shape variables correspond to a face versus an alternative model. Incomplete constellations, which occur when some of the true features are missed, are handled in a principled way."

Because of this property, researchers have attempted to use affine invariants for recognition. However, there are two problems with this approach: (1) objects or object classes with inherent variability cannot be adequately treated using invariants; and (2) in practice the calculated affine invariants can be quite sensitive to errors in the image plane measurements. In this paper we use probability distributions to address both of these difficulties. Under the assumption that the feature positions of a planar object can be modeled using a jointly Gaussian density, we have derived the joint density over the corresponding set of affine coordinates. Even when the assumptions of a planar object and a weak perspective camera model do not strictly hold, the results are useful because deviations from the ideal can be treated as deformability in the underlying object model."

Such natural textures arise from spatial variation of two surface attributes: (1) reflectance and (2) surface normal. In this paper, we provide a unified model to address both these aspects of natural texture. The main idea is to construct a vocabulary of prototype tiny surface patches with associated local geometric and photometric properties. We call these 3D textons. Examples might be ridges, grooves, spots or stripes or combinations thereof Associated with each texton is an appearance vector, which characterizes the local irradiance distribution, represented as a set of linear Gaussian derivative filter outputs, under different lighting and viewing conditions. Given a large collection of images of different materials, a clustering approach is used to acquire a small (on the order of 100) 3D texton vocabulary. Given a few (1 to 4) images of any material, it can be characterized using these textons. We demonstrate the application of this representation for recognition of the material viewed under novel lighting and viewing conditions."

Salient points are those which have a low probability of being mistaken with other points in the face, and therefore are more likely to be correctly located in a second face. The local image structure at each image point is described by vectors of Cartesian differential invariants computed at a range of scales. Salient points lie in low density regions of the distribution of all vectors of invariants found in an image. The vectors of invariants of salient points are used to locate similar features in a second image. Results are presented, showing that salient facial features can be relocated more reliably than arbitrary facial features."

                "text": "In supernova (SN) spectroscopy relatively little attention has been given to the properties of optically thick spectral lines in epochs following the photosphere\u2019s recession. Most treatments and analyses of post-photospheric optical spectra of SNe assume that forbidden-line emission comprises most if not all spectral features. However, evidence exists that suggests that some spectra exhibit line profiles formed via optically thick resonance-scattering even months or years after the SN explosion. To explore this possibility, we present a geometrical approach to SN spectrum formation based on the \u201cElementary Supernova\u201d model, wherein we investigate the characteristics of resonance-scattering in optically thick lines while replacing the photosphere with a transparent central core emitting non-blackbody continuum radiation, akin to the optical continuum provided by decaying 56Co formed during the explosion. We develop the mathematical framework necessary for solving the radiative transfer equation under these conditions and calculate spectra for both isolated and blended lines. Our comparisons with analogous results from the Elementary Supernova code SYNOW reveal several marked differences in line formation. Most notably, resonance lines in these conditions form P Cygni-like profiles, but the emission peaks and absorption troughs shift redward and blueward, respectively, from the line\u2019s rest wavelength by a significant amount, despite the spherically symmetric distribution of the line optical depth in the ejecta. These properties and others that we find in this work could lead to misidentification of lines or misattribution of properties of line-forming material at post-photospheric times in SN optical spectra."
