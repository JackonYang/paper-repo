First, there is the problem of variable illumination, which can be addressed by working with relatively stable features such as intensity edges rather than the raw intensity images1,2. Second, there is the problem of the initially unknown pose of the object relative to the viewer. In one approach to this problem, a hypothesis is first made about the viewpoint, then the appearance of a model object from such a viewpoint is computed and compared with the actual image3\u20137. Such recognition schemes generally employ 3-D models of objects, but the automatic learning of 3-D models is itself a difficult problem8,9. To address this problem in computational vision, we have developed a scheme, based on the theory of approximation of multivariate functions, that learns from a small set of perspective views a function mapping any viewpoint to a standard view. A network equivalent to this scheme will thus 'recognize' the object on which it was trained from any viewpoint."

Given a set of objects, the goal is to determine the illumination for which the objects are most distinguishable in appearance from each other. For each object, a large number of images is automatically obtained by varying pose and illumination. Images of all objects, together, constitute the planning image set. The planning set is compressed using the Karhunen-Loeve transform to obtain a low-dimensional subspace. For any given illumination, objects are represented as parametrized manifolds in the subspace. The minimum distance between the manifolds of too objects represents the similarity between the objects in the correlation sense. The optimal illumination is therefore one that maximizes the shortest distance between object manifolds. Results produced by the illumination planner heave been used to enhance the performance of an object recognition system.<<ETX>>"

A general learning algorithm is presented for determining the mapping between robot position and object appearance. The robot is first moved through several displacements with respect to its desired position, and a large set of object images is acquired. This image set is compressed using principal component analysis to obtain a four-dimensional subspace. Variations in object images due to robot displacements are represented as a compact parametrized manifold in the subspace. While positioning or tracking, errors in end-effector coordinates are efficiently computed from a single brightness image using the parametric manifold representation. The learning component enables accurate visual control without any prior hand-eye calibration. Several experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the practical feasibility of the proposed positioning/tracking approach and its relevance to industrial applications.<<ETX>>"

We develop a new method for computing a transformation from a three-dimensional model coordinate frame to the two-dimensional image coordinate frame, using three pairs of model and image points. We show that this transformation always exists for three noncollinear points, and is unique up to a reflective ambiguity. The solution method is closed-form and only involves second-order equations. We have implemented a recognition system that uses this transformation method to determine possible alignments of a model with an image. Each of these hypothesized matches is verified by comparing the entire edge contours of the aligned object with the image edges. Using the entire edge contours for verification, rather than a few local feature points, reduces the chance of finding false matches. The system has been tested on partly occluded objects in highly cluttered scenes."

This segmented representation may be viewed as a graph whose nodes capture information about the individual surface patches and whose links represent the relationships between them, such as occlusion and connectivity. On the basis of these relations, a graph for a given scene is decomposed into subgraphs corresponding to different objects. A model is represented by a set of such descriptions from multiple viewing angles, typically four to six. Models can therefore be acquired and represented automatically. Matching between the objects in a scene and the models is performed by three modules: the screener, in which the most likely candidate views for each object are found; the graph matcher, which compares the potential matching graphs and computes the 3-D transformation between them; and the analyzer, which takes a critical look at the results and proposes to split and merge object graphs. >"

The goal of these algorithms is to recognize the identity, position, and orientation of randomly oriented industrial parts. In one form this is commonly referred to as the \"bin-picking\" problem, in which the parts to be recognized are presented in a jumbled bin. The paper is organized according to 2-D, 2\u00bd-D, and 3-D object representations, which are used as the basis for the recognition algorithms. Three central issues common to each category, namely, feature extraction, modeling, and matching, are examined in detail. An evaluation and comparison of existing industrial part-recognition systems and algorithms is given, providing insights for progress toward future robot vision systems."

This function can be derived explicitly for the case of visual perception of rigid bodies by ambulant observers. The function depends on physical causation, not physiology; consequently, one can make a priori statements about possible internal models. A posteriori it seems likely that the orientation sensitive units described by Hubel and Wiesel constitute a physiological substrate subserving the extraction of the invariants of this function. The function is used to define a measure for the visual complexity of solid shape. Relations with Gestalt theories of perception are discussed."

Learning as approximation and learning as hypersurface reconstruction are discussed. Two extensions of the regularization approach are presented, along with the approach's corrections to splines, regularization, Bayes formulation, and clustering.

Our findings indicate that with practice the response times for different views become more uniform and the initially orderly dependency of the response time on the distance to a ``good'''' view disappears. One possible interpretation of our results is in terms of a tradeoff between memory needed for storing specific-view representations of objects and time spent in recognizing the objects."
