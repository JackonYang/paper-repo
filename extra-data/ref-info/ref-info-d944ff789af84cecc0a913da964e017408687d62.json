                "text": "Natura scenes consist of a wide variety of stochastic patterns. While many patterns are represented well by statistical models in two dimensional regions as most image segmentation work assume, some other patterns are fundamentally one dimensional and thus cause major problems in segmentation. We call the former region processes and the latter curve processes. In this paper, we propose a stochastic algorithm for parsing an image into a number of region and curve processes. The paper makes the following contributions to the literature. Firstly, it presents a generative rope model for the curve processes in the form of Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The hidden layer is a Markov chain with each element being an image vase selected from an over-complete basis, such as Difference of Gaussians (DOG) or Difference of Offset Gaussians (DOOG) at various scales and orientations. The rope model accounts for the geometric smoothness and photometric coherence of the curve processes. Secondly, it integrates both 2D region models, such as textures, splines etc with 1D curve models uner the Bayes framework. Because both region and curve models are generative, they compete to explain input images in a layered representation. Thirdl, it achieves global optimization by effective Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in the sense of maximizing a posterior probability. The Markov chain consists of reversivle jumps and diffusions driven by bottom up information. The algorithm is applied to real images with satisfactory results. We verify the results through random synthesis and compare them against segmentations with region processes only."

The paper contributes to image segmentation in four aspects. First, it designs efficient and well-balanced Markov Chain dynamics to explore the complex solution space and, thus, achieves a nearly global optimal solution independent of initial segmentations. Second, it presents a mathematical principle and a K-adventurers algorithm for computing multiple distinct solutions from the Markov chain sequence and, thus, it incorporates intrinsic ambiguities in image segmentation. Third, it utilizes data-driven (bottom-up) techniques, such as clustering and edge detection, to compute importance proposal probabilities, which drive the Markov chain dynamics and achieve tremendous speedup in comparison to the traditional jump-diffusion methods. Fourth, the DDMCMC paradigm provides a unifying framework in which the role of many existing segmentation algorithms, such as, edge detection, clustering, region growing, split-merge, snake/balloon, and region competition, are revealed as either realizing Markov chain dynamics or computing importance proposal probabilities. Thus, the DDMCMC paradigm combines and generalizes these segmentation methods in a principled way. The DDMCMC paradigm adopts seven parametric and nonparametric image models for intensity and color at various regions. We test the DDMCMC paradigm extensively on both color and gray-level images and some results are reported in this paper."

Our approach is sequential testing which is coarse-to-fine in both in the exploration of poses and the representation of objects. All the tests are binary and indicate the presence or absence of loose spatial arrangements of oriented edge fragments. Starting from training examples, we recursively find larger and larger arrangements which are \u201cdecomposable,\u201d which implies the probability of an arrangement appearing on an object decays slowly with its size. Detection means finding a sufficient number of arrangements of each size along a decreasing sequence of pose cells. At the beginning, the tests are simple and universal, accommodating many poses simultaneously, but the false alarm rate is relatively high. Eventually, the tests are more discriminating, but also more complex and dedicated to specific poses. As a result, the spatial distribution of processing is highly skewed and detection is rapid, but at the expense of (isolated) false alarms which, presumably, could be eliminated with localized, more intensive, processing."

The splines are adjusted using a novel elastic matching procedure based on the expectation maximization algorithm that maximizes the likelihood of the model generating the data. This approach has many advantages: 1) the system not only produces a classification of the digit but also a rich description of the instantiation parameters which can yield information such as the writing style; 2) the generative models can perform recognition driven segmentation; 3) the method involves a relatively small number of parameters and hence training is relatively easy and fast; and 4) unlike many other recognition schemes, it does not rely on some form of pre-normalization of input images, but can handle arbitrary scalings, translations and a limited degree of image rotation. We have demonstrated that our method of fitting models to images does not get trapped in poor local minima. The main disadvantage of the method is that it requires much more computation than more standard OCR techniques."

Natural images contain both textured and untextured regions, so the cues of contour and texture differences are exploited simultaneously. Contours are treated in the intervening contour framework, while texture is analyzed using textons. Each of these cues has a domain of applicability, so to facilitate cue combination we introduce a gating operator based on the texturedness of the neighborhood at a pixel. Having obtained a local measure of how likely two nearby pixels are to belong to the same region, we use the spectral graph theoretic framework of normalized cuts to find partitions of the image into regions of coherent texture and brightness. Experimental results on a wide range of images are shown."

One method uses a mixture of factor analyzers to concurrently perform clustering and, within each cluster, perform local dimensionality reduction. The parameters of the mixture model are estimated using an EM algorithm. A face is detected if the probability of an input sample is above a predefined threshold. The other mixture of subspaces method uses Kohonen's self-organizing map for clustering and Fisher linear discriminant to find the optimal projection for pattern classification, and a Gaussian distribution to model the class-conditioned density function of the projected samples for each class. The parameters of the class-conditioned density functions are maximum likelihood estimates and the decision rule is also based on maximum likelihood. A wide range of face images including ones in different poses, with different expressions and under different lighting conditions are used as the training set to capture the variations of human faces. Our methods have been tested on three sets of 225 images which contain 871 faces. Experimental results on the first two datasets show that our methods perform as well as the best methods in the literature, yet have fewer false detects."

We focus on a model where objects are represented as constellations of rigid features (parts). Variability is represented by a joint probability density function (PDF) on the shape of the constellation. In the first stage, the method automatically identifies distinctive features in the training set using an interest operator followed by vector quantization. The set of model parameters, including the shape PDF, is then learned using expectation maximization. Experiments show good generalization performance to novel viewpoints and unseen faces. Performance is above 90% correct with less than 1 s computation time per image."

Those probability densities are then used to formulate a maximum-likelihood estimation framework for visual search and target detection for automatic object recognition and coding.

The limits of applicability of the algorithms are also traced by making the optical degradations more and more severe until the algorithms no longer succeed in their task.

In such domains a cascade of simple classifiers each trained to achieve high detection rates and modest false positive rates can yield a final detector with many desirable features: including high detection rates, very low false positive rates, and fast performance. Achieving extremely high detection rates, rather than low error, is not a task typically addressed by machine learning algorithms. We propose a new variant of AdaBoost as a mechanism for training the simple classifiers used in the cascade. Experimental results in the domain of face detection show the training algorithm yields significant improvements in performance over conventional AdaBoost. The final face detection system can process 15 frames per second, achieves over 90% detection, and a false positive rate of 1 in a 1,000,000."

The performance of our automatic text location algorithm is shown in several applications.

News captions generally provide vital search information about the video being presented, the names of people and places or descriptions of objects. In this paper, two difficult problems of character recognition for videos are addressed: low resolution characters and extremely complex backgrounds. We apply an interpolation filter, multi-frame integration and a combination of four filters to solve these problems. Segmenting characters is done by a recognition-based segmentation method and intermediate character recognition results are used to improve the segmentation. The overall recognition results are good enough for use in news indexing. Performing video OCR on news video and combining its results with other video understanding techniques will improve the overall understanding of the news video content."

News captions generally provide vital search information about the video being presented { the names of people and places or descriptions of objects. In this paper, two di cult problems of character recognition for videos are addressed: low resolution characters and extremely complex backgrounds. We apply an interpolation lter, multi-frame integration and a combination of four lters to solve these problems. Segmenting characters is done by a recognition-based segmentation method and intermediate character recognition results are used to improve the segmentation. The overall recognition results are good enough for use in news indexing. Performing Video OCR on news video and combining its results with other video understanding techniques will improve the overall understanding of the news video content."

We also introduced the related notion of a \"pseudo-loss\" which is a method for forcing a learning algorithm of multi-label concepts to concentrate on the labels that are hardest to discriminate. In this paper, we describe experiments we carried out to assess how well AdaBoost with and without pseudo-loss, performs on real learning problems. We performed two sets of experiments. The first set compared boosting to Breiman's \"bagging\" method when used to aggregate various classifiers (including decision trees and single attribute- value tests). We compared the performance of the two methods on a collection of machine-learning benchmarks. In the second set of experiments, we studied in more detail the performance of boosting using a nearest-neighbor classifier on an OCR problem."

One of the main properties of boosting that has made it interesting to statisticians and others is its relative (but not complete) immunity to overrtting. As pointed out by the authors, the current paper does not address this issue. Leo Breiman 1] tried to explain this behaviour in terms of bias and variance. In our paper with Bartlett and Lee 4], we gave an explanation in terms of the \\margins\" of the training examples and the VC-dimension of the base class. Breiman, as well as the current paper, point out that our bounds are very rough and yield bounds that are not useful in practice. While this is clearly true at this time, it is also true that the analysis given by Breiman and by this paper yield no provable bounds whatsoever. It is completely unclear whether this analysis can be used to predict the performance of classiication rules outside of the training sample. At the root of this argument about boosting is a much more fundamental argument about the type of prior assumptions that one should make when embarking on the task of inducing a classiication rule from data. The assumption that seems to underlie the use of maximum likelihood in the 1"

The book also explores the underlying mathematics and applies these mathematical techniques to the computer vision problem of face recognition, using both optical and range images."
