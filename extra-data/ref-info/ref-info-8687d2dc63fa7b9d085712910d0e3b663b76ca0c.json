This requires solving several sub-problems simultaneously, including object detection, region labeling, and geometric reasoning. The last few decades have seen great progress in tackling each of these problems in isolation. Only recently have researchers returned to the difficult task of considering them jointly. In this work, we consider learning a set of related models in such that they both solve their own problem and help each other. We develop a framework called Cascaded Classification Models (CCM), where repeated instantiations of these classifiers are coupled by their input/output variables in a cascade that improves performance at each level. Our method requires only a limited \"black box\" interface with the models, allowing us to use very sophisticated, state-of-the-art classifiers without having to look under the hood. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a large set of natural images by combining the subtasks of scene categorization, object detection, multiclass image segmentation, and 3d reconstruction."

The next challenge is to integrate all these algorithms and address the problem of scene understanding. This paper is a step towards this goal. We present a probabilistic framework for reasoning about regions, objects, and their attributes such as object class, location, and spatial extent. Our model is a Conditional Random Field defined on pixels, segments and objects. We define a global energy function for the model, which combines results from sliding window detectors, and low-level pixel-based unary and pairwise relations. One of our primary contributions is to show that this energy function can be solved efficiently. Experimental results show that our model achieves significant improvement over the baseline methods on CamVid and PASCAL VOC datasets."

The integration of these different types of approaches should boost performance for both tasks as object detection can profit from powerful scene labeling and also pixel-wise scene labeling can profit from powerful object detection. Consequently, first approaches have been proposed that aim to integrate both object detection and scene labeling in one framework. This paper proposes a novel approach based on conditional random field (CRF) models that extends existing work by 1) formulating the integration as a joint labeling problem of object and scene classes and 2) by systematically integrating dynamic information for the object detection task as well as for the scene labeling task. As a result, the approach is applicable to highly dynamic scenes including both fast camera and object movements. Experiments show the applicability of the novel approach to challenging real-world video sequences and systematically analyze the contribution of different system components to the overall performance."

One reason is their ability to incorporate contextual information at different scales. However, these models do not allow multiple labels to be assigned to a single node. At higher scales in the image, this yields an oversimplified model, since multiple classes can be reasonable expected to appear within one region. This simplified model especially limits the impact that observations at larger scales may have on the CRF model. Neglecting the information at larger scales is undesirable since class-label estimates based on these scales are more reliable than at smaller, noisier scales. To address this problem, we propose a new potential, called harmony potential, which can encode any possible combination of class labels. We propose an effective sampling strategy that renders tractable the underlying optimization problem. Results show that our approach obtains state-of-the-art results on two challenging datasets: Pascal VOC 2009 and MSRC-21."

However, as they consider objects as loose collections of local patches they fail to accurately locate object boundaries and are not able to produce accurate object segmentation. On the other hand, Markov random field models used for image segmentation focus on object boundaries but can hardly use the global constraints necessary to deal with object categories whose appearance may vary significantly. In this paper we combine the advantages of both approaches. First, a mechanism based on local regions allows object detection using visual word occurrences and produces a rough image segmentation. Then, a MRF component gives clean boundaries and enforces label consistency, guided by local image cues (color, texture and edge cues) and by long-distance dependencies. Gibbs sampling is used to infer the model. The proposed method successfully segments object categories with highly varying appearances in the presence of cluttered backgrounds and large view point changes. We show that it outperforms published results on the Pascal VOC 2007 dataset."

We build upon the part-based pose-let detector, which can predict masks for numerous parts of an object. For this purpose we extend poselets to 19 other categories apart from person. We non-rigidly align these part detections to potential object contours in the image, both to increase the precision of the predicted object mask and to sort out false positives. We spatially aggregate object information via a variational smoothing technique while ensuring that object regions do not overlap. Finally, we propose to refine the segmentation based on self-similarity defined on small image patches. We obtain competitive results on the challenging Pascal VOC benchmark. On four classes we achieve the best numbers to-date."

But while much success has been reported in detecting several rectangular-shaped object classes (i.e. faces, cars, pedestrians), results have been much less impressive for more general types of objects. Several researchers have advocated the use of image segmentation as a way to get a better spatial support for objects. In this paper, our aim is to address this issue by studying the following two questions: 1) how important is good spatial support for recognition? 2) can segmentation provide better spatial support for objects? To answer the first, we compare recognition performance using ground-truth segmentation vs. bounding boxes. To answer the second, we use the multiple segmentation approach to evaluate how close can real segments approach the ground-truth for real objects, and at what cost. Our results demonstrate the importance of finding the right spatial support for objects, and the feasibility of doing so without excessive computational burden."

Region features are appealing in this context because: (1) they encode shape and scale information of objects naturally; (2) they are only mildly affected by background clutter. Regions have not been popular as features due to their sensitivity to segmentation errors. In this paper, we start by producing a robust bag of overlaid regions for each image using Arbeldez et al., CVPR 2009. Each region is represented by a rich set of image cues (shape, color and texture). We then learn region weights using a max-margin framework. In detection and segmentation, we apply a generalized Hough voting scheme to generate hypotheses of object locations, scales and support, followed by a verification classifier and a constrained segmenter on each hypothesis. The proposed approach significantly outperforms the state of the art on the ETHZ shape database(87.1% average detection rate compared to Ferrari et al. 's 67.2%), and achieves competitive performance on the Caltech 101 database."

The model is based on a set of parts which describe the expected appearance and position, in an object centered coordinate frame, of features detected by a low-level interest operator. Each object category then has its own distribution over these parts, which are shared between objects. We learn the parameters of this model via a Gibbs sampler which uses the graphical model's structure to analytically average over many parameters. Applied to a database of images of isolated objects, the sharing of parts among objects improves detection accuracy when few training examples are available. We also extend this hierarchical framework to scenes containing multiple objects"

To exploit both local image data as well as contextual information, we introduce Boosted Random Fields (BRFs), which uses Boosting to learn the graph structure and local evidence of a conditional random field (CRF). The graph structure is learned by assembling graph fragments in an additive model. The connections between individual pixels are not very informative, but by using dense graphs, we can pool information from large regions of the image; dense models also support efficient inference. We show how contextual information from other objects can improve detection performance, both in terms of accuracy and speed, by using a computational cascade. We apply our system to detect stuff and things in office and street scenes."

However, scene understanding research has been constrained by the limited scope of currently-used databases which do not capture the full variety of scene categories. Whereas standard databases for object categorization contain hundreds of different classes of objects, the largest available dataset of scene categories contains only 15 classes. In this paper we propose the extensive Scene UNderstanding (SUN) database that contains 899 categories and 130,519 images. We use 397 well-sampled categories to evaluate numerous state-of-the-art algorithms for scene recognition and establish new bounds of performance. We measure human scene classification performance on the SUN database and compare this with computational methods. Additionally, we study a finer-grained scene representation to detect scenes embedded inside of larger scenes."

In this paper we consider a class of global potentials defined over all variables in the CRF. We show how they can be readily optimised using standard graph cut algorithms at little extra expense compared to a standard pairwise field. \n \nThis result can be directly used for the problem of class based image segmentation which has seen increasing recent interest within computer vision. Here the aim is to assign a label to each pixel of a given image from a set of possible object classes. Typically these methods use random fields to model local interactions between pixels or super-pixels. One of the cues that helps recognition is global object co-occurrence statistics, a measure of which classes (such as chair or motorbike) are likely to occur in the same image together. There have been several approaches proposed to exploit this property, but all of them suffer from different limitations and typically carry a high computational cost, preventing their application on large images. We find that the new model we propose produces an improvement in the labelling compared to just using a pairwise model."

First, it encodes both the short-range interactions (e.g., pixelwise label smoothing) as well as the long-range interactions (e.g., relative configurations of objects or regions) in a tractable manner. Second, the formulation is general enough to be applied to different domains ranging from pixelwise image labeling to contextual object detection. The parameters of the model are learned using a sequential maximum-likelihood approximation. The benefits of the proposed framework are demonstrated on four different datasets and comparison results are presented"

Organised annually from 2005 to present, the challenge and its associated dataset has become accepted as the benchmark for object detection.This paper describes the dataset and evaluation procedure. We review the state-of-the-art in evaluated methods for both classification and detection, analyse whether the methods are statistically different, what they are learning from the images (e.g. the object or its context), and what the methods find easy or confuse. The paper concludes with lessons learnt in the three year history of the challenge, and proposes directions for future improvement and extension."

However, these frameworks tend to exploit the provided bounding box merely to exclude its exterior from consideration and sometimes to initialize the energy minimization. In this paper, we discuss how the bounding box can be further used to impose a powerful topological prior, which prevents the solution from excessive shrinking and ensures that the user-provided box bounds the segmentation in a sufficiently tight way. The prior is expressed using hard constraints incorporated into the global energy minimization framework leading to an NP-hard integer program. We then investigate the possible optimization strategies including linear relaxation as well as a new graph cut algorithm called pinpointing. The latter can be used either as a rounding method for the fractional LP solution, which is provably better than thresholding-based rounding, or as a fast standalone heuristic. We evaluate the proposed algorithms on a publicly available dataset, and demonstrate the practical benefits of the new prior both qualitatively and quantitatively."

While region-level models often feature dense pairwise connectivity, pixel-level models are considerably larger and have only permitted sparse graph structures. In this paper, we consider fully connected CRF models defined on the complete set of pixels in an image. The resulting graphs have billions of edges, making traditional inference algorithms impractical. Our main contribution is a highly efficient approximate inference algorithm for fully connected CRF models in which the pairwise edge potentials are defined by a linear combination of Gaussian kernels. Our experiments demonstrate that dense connectivity at the pixel level substantially improves segmentation and labeling accuracy."

These are ensembles of decision trees that act directly on image pixels, and therefore do not need the expensive computation of filter-bank responses or local descriptors. They are extremely fast to both train and test, especially compared with k-means clustering and nearest-neighbor assignment of feature descriptors. The nodes in the trees provide (i) an implicit hierarchical clustering into semantic textons, and (ii) an explicit local classification estimate. Our second contribution, the bag of semantic textons, combines a histogram of semantic textons over an image region with a region prior category distribution. The bag of semantic textons is computed over the whole image for categorization, and over local rectangular regions for segmentation. Including both histogram and region prior allows our segmentation algorithm to exploit both textural and semantic context. Our third contribution is an image-level prior for segmentation that emphasizes those categories that the automatic categorization believes to be present. We evaluate on two datasets including the very challenging VOC 2007 segmentation dataset. Our results significantly advance the state-of-the-art in segmentation accuracy, and furthermore, our use of efficient decision forests gives at least a five-fold increase in execution speed."

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

Specifically, we introduce a class of higher order clique potentials and show that the expansion and swap moves for any energy function composed of these potentials can be found by minimizing a submodular function. We also show that for a subset of these potentials, the optimal move can be found by solving an st-mincut problem. We refer to this subset as the P3 Potts model. Our results enable the use of powerful move making algorithms i.e. alpha-expansion and alphabeta-swap for minimization of energy functions involving higher order cliques. Such functions have the capability of modelling the rich statistics of natural scenes and can be used for many applications in computer vision. We demonstrate their use on one such application i.e. the texture based video segmentation problem."

Our contour detector combines multiple local cues into a globalization framework based on spectral clustering. Our segmentation algorithm consists of generic machinery for transforming the output of any contour detector into a hierarchical region tree. In this manner, we reduce the problem of image segmentation to that of contour detection. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that both our contour detection and segmentation methods significantly outperform competing algorithms. The automatically generated hierarchical segmentations can be interactively refined by user-specified annotations. Computation at multiple image resolutions provides a means of coupling our system to recognition applications."

Specifically, we introduce a class of higher order clique potentials and show that the expansion and swap moves for any energy function composed of these potentials can be found by minimizing a submodular function. We also show that for a subset of these potentials, the optimal move can be found by solving an st-mincut problem. We refer to this subset as the Pn Potts model. Our results enable the use of powerful move making algorithms i.e. \u03b1-expansion and \u03b1\u03b2-swap for minimization of energy functions involving higher order cliques. Such functions have the capability of modelling the rich statistics of natural scenes and can be used for many applications in computer vision. We demonstrate their use on one such application i.e. the texture based video segmentation problem."

Our method can handle large problems efficiently by distributing and parallelizing the computation and memory requirements. The convergence and optimality guarantees of recently developed message-passing algorithms are preserved by introducing new types of consistency messages, sent between the distributed computers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the task of stereo reconstruction from high-resolution imagery, and show that inference is possible with more than 200 labels in images larger than 10 MPixels."
