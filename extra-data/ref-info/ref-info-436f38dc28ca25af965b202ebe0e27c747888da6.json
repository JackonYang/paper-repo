The application of hidden Markov models in speech recognition is discussed. We show that the conventional dynamic time-warping algorithm with Linear Predictive (LP) signal modeling and distortion measurements can be formulated in a strictly statistical framework. It is further shown that the DTW/LP method is implicitly associated with a specific class of Markov models and is equivalent to the probability maximization procedures for Gaussian autoregressive multivariate probabilistic functions of the underlying Markov model. This unified view offers insights into the effectiveness of the probabilistic models in speech recognition applications."

The resulting recognizer was tested on a vocabulary of the ten digits across a wide range of talkers and test conditions and shown to have an error rate comparable to that of the best template recognizers and significantly lower than that of the discrete symbol hidden Markov model system. We discuss several issues involved in the training of the continuous density models and in the implementation of the recognizer."

Such models are called Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and are useful representations for speech signals in terms of some convenient observations (e.g., cepstral coefficients or pseudolog area ratios). One method of estimating parameters of HMMs is the well-known Baum-Welch reestimation method. For continuous pdf's, the method was known to work only for elliptically symmetric densities. We have recently shown that the method can be generalized to handle mixtures of elliptically symmetric pdf's. Any continuous pdf can be approximated to any desired accuracy by such mixtures, in particular, by mixtures of multivariate Gaussian pdf's. To effectively make use of this method of parameter estimation, it is necessary to understand how it is affected by the amount of training data available, the number of states in the Markov chain, the dimensionality of the signal, etc. To study these issues, Markov chains and random vector generators were simulated to generate training sequences from \u201ctoy\u201d models. The model parameters were estimated from these training sequences and compared to the \u201ctrue\u201d parameters by means of an appropriate distance measure. The results of several such experiments show the strong sensitivity of the method to some (but not all) of the model parameters. A procedure for getting good initial parameter estimates is, therefore, of considerable importance."

A time series is represented as a sample sequence generated by a finite state hidden Markov model with output densities parameterized by linear prediction polynomials and error variances. These objects are defined and their properties developed. The theory culminates in a theorem that provides a computationally efficient iterative scheme to improve the model. The theorem has been used to create models from speech signals of considerable length. One such model is examined with emphasis on the relationship between states of the model and traditional classes of speech events. A use of the method is illustrated by an application to the talker verification problem."

First we give a concise review of the literature with emphasis on the Baum-Welch algorithm. This is followed by a detailed discussion of three issues not treated in the literature: alternatives to the Baum-Welch algorithm; critical facets of the implementation of the algorithms, with emphasis on their numerical properties; and behavior of Markov models on certain artificial but realistic problems. Special attention is given to a particular class of Markov models, which we call \u201cleft-to-right\u201d models. This class of models is especially appropriate for isolated word recognition. The results of the application of these methods to an isolated word, speaker-independent speech recognition experiment are given in a companion paper."

This paper presents a new approach called vector quantization. For very low data rates, realistic experiments have shown that vector quantization can achieve a given level of average distortion with 15 to 20 fewer bits/frame than that required for the optimized scalar quantizing approaches presently in use. The vector quantizing approach is shown to be a mathematically and computationally tractable method which builds upon knowledge obtained in linear prediction analysis studies. This paper introduces the theory in a nonrigorous form, along with practical results to date and an extensive list of research topics for this new area of speech coding."

For speaker trained systems, the techniques that have been used include casual training, averaging, and use of statistical pattern recognition clustering methods. In a recent study, Rabiner and Wilpon showed that the statistical techniques, when combined with the technique of averaging the autocorrelation coefficients of all tokens within the cluster, provided a reliable, robust set of reference templates. The only drawback to this method was the extensive, burdensome training required for the statistical analysis. Since the statistical training method could not be used in most practical situations, techniques were investigated for obtaining a simplified, robust training procedure which would incorporate many of the ideas of the statistical approach. Such a training method is described in this paper. The advantages of this new training procedure, over (previously used..."

These studies have used a 39\u2010word alpha\u2010digit vocabulary and a 54\u2010word vocabulary of computer terms. In this paper the clustering procedures, developed previously, are extended to create reference tokens for a 129\u2010word vocabulary of airline reservation terms. Instead of using a single, casually obtained token of each word by each of 100 talkers for the clustering procedure, each talker used the robust training procedure of Rabiner and Wilpon to provide a robust token of each vocabulary word. The effect on the clustering is to reduce the number of outlier tokens and to provide more robust clusters. Recognition tests using 20 new talkers yielded recognition accuracies of between 80%\u201397%. These accuracies are comparable to those obtained in an earlier study on the same vocabulary with speaker trained reference patterns."

It can be viewed as an adaptive vector quantizer with backward estimation, a vector generalization of an AQB system. Recently a family of algorithms for the design of FSVQ's for waveform coding application has been introduced. These algorithms first design an initial set of vector quantizers together with a next-state function giving the rule by which the next quantizer is selected. The codebooks of this initial FSVQ are then iteratively improved by a natural extension of the usual memoryless vector quantizer design algorithm. The next-state function, however, is not modified from its initial form. In this paper we present two extensions of the FSVQ design algorithms. First, the algorithm for FSVQ design for waveform coders is extended to FSVQ design of linear predictive coded (LPC) speech parameter vectors using an Itakura-Saito distortion measure. Second, we introduce a new technique for the iterative improvement of the next-state function based on an algorithm from adaptive stochastic automata theory. The design algorithms are simulated for an LPC FSVQ and the results are compared with each other and to ordinary memoryless vector quantization. Several open problems suggested by the simulation results are presented."

The computer, under program control, has access to the transport functions as well as the position counter of the cassette deck. In addition, there is a capability of reading and writing digital headers. Digital headers are particularly useful in enabling descriptive information to be written directly with the speech samples as well as enabling precise location of individual samples in a data base. The facility offers an attractive means for compactly storing large data bases of speech samples with relatively easy access to individual samples. An experiment is described in which speech sample utterances were digitized and processed on\u2010line simultaneously with recording directly onto cassette tapes with descriptive digital headers. The recorded speech samples were digitized and processed in the same way and compared with the directly digitized and..."
