                "text": "IN man the two eyes receive slightly differing views of the world. The visual system utilises this disparity for stereoscopic depth perception. This involves a difficult correspondence problem for establishing binocular fusion: for each surface feature extracted from one eye's image, the brain has to decide which is the equivalent feature in the other eye's image. Ambiguities often exist, particularly for densely-textured visual surfaces, but one aspect of binocular visual processing which helps reduce the scale of the problem is that for any given vergence angle, the visual system considers only those potential left/right fusions with disparities under a certain limiting size (defined by Panum's fusional areas1,2). This disparity limit, however, requires that when disparities greater than Panum's area are presented, a suitable vergence change must be initiated to bring corresponding features within the allowable range for fusion. A question currently of considerable theoretical interest concerns the nature of the stimulus characteristics used to initiate these essential vergence movements. The interest stems mainly from Marr and Poggio's model of human stereo vision3,4 in which false correspondences are avoided by seeking left/right fusions within spatial frequency tuned disparity channels whose disparity range is closely tied to their spatial frequency sensitivity5. By setting the disparity range of any given channel to about \u00b1 w (where w = the width of the centre of the receptive fields of the channel in question) Marr and Poggio have demonstrated that false matches are improbable and any that do emerge are easily eliminated using quite simple rules. A further feature of the model is that the outputs of low spatial frequency tuned channels (that is units capable of dealing with large disparities because of their relatively large receptive fields) can initiate vergence movements bringing into correspondence higher spatial frequency channels mediating smaller disparities. The theory predicts that in the case of a two-planar densely-textured stereogram (for example Fig. 1a\u2013c] in which the disparity range exceeds the size appropriate for the lowest spatial frequency channels activated by the stereogram's texture, vergence movements should exhibit only a random-search structure. We report here an experimental test of this prediction which shows that vergence movements are not always random in the stimulus circumstances just specified. Rather, vergence can be guided by texture contours (Fig. 1b) depicted by differences of texture orientation between regions of relatively high spatial frequency content for the disparity range incorporated in the stereogram. Moreover, we find that such texture contours can facilitate stereopsis in a way consistent with the idea that they do so by initiating appropriate eye movements."

The author has analyzed the computations performed in the course of visual motion analysis. Workable schemes able to perform certain tasks performed by the visual system have been constructed and used as vehicles for investigating the problems faced by the visual system and its methods for solving them.Two major problems are treated: first, the correspondence problem, which concerns the identification of image elements that represent the same object at different times, thereby maintaining the perceptual identity of the object in motion or in change. The second problem is the three-dimensional interpretation of the changing image once a correspondence has been established.The author's computational approach to visual theory makes the work unique, and it should be of interest to psychologists working in visual perception and readers interested in cognitive studies in general, as well as computer scientists interested in machine vision, theoretical neurophysiologists, and philosophers of science."

                "text": "An introduction is given to a theory of early visual information processing. The theory has been implemented, and examples are given of images at various stages of analysis. It is argued that the first step of consequence is to compute a primitive but rich description of the grey-level changes present in an image. The description is expressed in a vocabulary of kinds of intensity change (EDGE, SHADING-EDGE, EXTENDED-EDGE, LINE, BLOB etc.). Modifying parameters are bound to the elements in the description, specifying their POSITION, ORIENTATION, TERMINATION points, CONTRAST, SIZE and FUZZINESS. This description is obtained from the intensity array by fixed techniques, and it is called the primal sketch. For most images, the primal sketch is large and unwieldy. The second important step in visual information processing is to group its contents in a way that is appropriate for later recognition. From our ability to interpret drawings with little semantic content, one may infer the presence in our perceptual equipment of symbolic processes that can define \"place-tokens\" in an image in various ways, and can group them according to certain rules. Homomorphic techniques fail to account for many of these grouping phenomena, whose explanations require mechanisms of construction rather than mechanisms of detection. The necessary grouping of elements in the primal sketch may be achieved by a mechanism that has available the processes inferred from above, together with the ability to select items by first order discriminations acting on the elements' parameters. Only occasionally do these mechanisms use downward-flowing information about the contents of the particular image being processed. It is argued that \"non-attentive\" vision is in practice implemented by these grouping operations and first order discriminations acting on the primal sketch. The class of computations so obtained differs slightly from the class of second order operations on the intensity array. The extraction of a form from the primal sketch using these techniques amounts to the separation of figure from ground. It is concluded that most of the separation can be carried out by using techniques that do not depend upon the particular image in question. Therefore, figure-ground separation can normally precede the description of the shape of the extracted form. Up to this point, higher-level knowledge and purpose are brought to bear on only a few of the decisions taken during the processing. This relegates the widespread use of downward-flowing information to a later stage than is found in current machine-vision programs, and implies that such knowledge should influence the control of, rather than interfering with, the actual data-processing that is taking place lower down."

(1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

Particularly important is the problem of finding binocular parallax, which involves matching patterns of the left and right visual fields. Stereo pictures of familiar objects or line drawings preclude the separation of interacting cues, and thus this pattern-matching process is difficult to investigate. More insight into the process can be gained by using unfamiliar picture material devoid of all cues except binocular parallax. To this end, artificial stereo picture pairs were generated on a digital computer. When viewed monocularly, they appear completely random, but if viewed binocularly, certain correlated point domains are seen in depth. By introducing distortions in this material and testing for perception of depth, it is possible to show that pattern-matching of corresponding points of the left and right visual fields can be achieved by first combining the two fields and then searching for patterns in the fused field. By this technique, some interesting properties of this fused binocular field are revealed, and a simple analog model is derived. The interaction between the monocular and binocular fields is also describea. A number of stereo images that demonstrate these and other findings are presented."

Three aspects of a representation\u2019s design are considered, (i) the representation\u2019s coordinate system, (ii) its primitives, which are the primary units of shape information used in the representation, and (iii) the organization the representation imposes on the information in its descriptions. 3. In terms of these design issues and the criteria presented, a shape representation for recognition should: (i) use an object-centred coordinate system, (ii) include volumetric primitives of varied sizes, and (iii) have a modular organization. A representation based on a shape\u2019s natural axes (for example the axes identified by a stick figure) follows directly from these choices. 4. The basic process for deriving a shape description in this representation must involve: (i) a means for identifying the natural axes of a shape in its image and (ii) a mechanism for transforming viewer-centred axis specifications to specifications in an object-centred coordinate system. 5. Shape recognition involves: (i) a collection of stored shape descriptions, and (ii) various indexes into the collection that allow a newly derived description to be associated with an appropriate stored description. The most important of these indexes allows shape recognition to proceed conservatively from the general to the specific based on the specificity of the information available from the image. 6. New constraints supplied by a conservative recognition process can be used to extract more information from the image. A relaxation process for carrying out this constraint analysis is described."

                "text": "The relation of the structure of the retina to factors influencing visual acuity is examined in some detail. Dimensions of the foveal cones have been redetermined in a series of measurements on histological materials from several sources. In no case has center to center distance between the most central cones in adult human eyes been found less than 2.0\u03bc nor greater than 2.3\u03bc, these being values for the living eye, due allowance being made for shrinkage of the preparations. Photomicrographs of the central foveal mosaic are shown to illustrate the rapid increase in center to center distance between cones a short distance from the small central fovea. These results are in general agreement with those of Polyak. This cone mosaic is in good accord with the observed effect on resolution acuity of the particular location of the image within the fovea. The central cones are of such size that the optical system of the eye at optimum pupil concentrates approximately three-quarters of the energy of a star image into a circle containing three cones, but some additional optical mechanism must exist in the retina to prevent loss of this image quality by spread of rays after the focus, but within the retinal depth represented by the length of the cones. Optical processes occurring within the cones are considered in detail. It is shown that not only is the Stiles and Crawford effect explained quantitatively by these processes, but also that the spread of rays beyond the focus is prevented, so that the retinal mosaic can behave as though the light receptors were concentrated in the focal plane. This same process also makes possible greatly increased light absorption per unit weight of cone pigment. The structure of the retina is thus consistent, numerically, with resolution acuity at high illumination but does not account for observed changes in acuity as retinal illumination is reduced. Ballistic stimulation of 10 microsecond duration eliminates effect of eye movements and serves to test both the Hecht theory of change of acuity with luminance, and the alternate hypothesis that very few quanta are absorbed per cone at threshold, statistical variation in this number accounting for the acuity change. The result of these experiments indicates that neither theory can be accepted."

In the present study, random-dot stereograms were bandpass filtered in the two-dimensional Fourier domain, and masking noise of various spatial frequency bands was added to the filtered stereograms. Masking noise bands containing equally effective noise energy were selected such that their bands were either overlapping with the stereoscopic image spectrum or were two octaves distant. The first case resulted in binocular rivalry; however, in the second case stereoscopic fusion could be maintained in the presence of strong binocular rivalry owing to the masking noise. This finding indicates that spatial-frequency-tuned channels are not restricted to one-dimensional gratings but operate on two-dimensional patterns as well. Furthermore, these frequency channels are utilized in stereopsis and work independently from each other, since some of these channels can be in binocular rivalry while at the same time other channels yield fusion. The main binocular experiments are demonstrated."

The partial sums of the series provide upper and lower bounds successively for Pm. The series converges particularly rapidly for small spacings r. It is shown that for fixed values of r, the density Pm(r) diminishes more rapidly than any negative power of m. The results are applied to Gaussian processes; then the first two terms of the series for Pm(T) may be expressed in terms of known functions. Special attention is paid to two cases: (1) In the \u2018regular\u2019 case the covariance function i/r(t) is expressible as a power series in then Pm(r) is of order r 1/2(m+2)(m+3)-2 at the origin, and in particular P (r) is of order r (adjacent zeros have a strong mutual repulsion). The first two terms of the series give the value of P0(t) correct to r18. (2) In a singular case, the covariance function p(t) has a discontinuity in the third derivative. This happens whenever the frequency spectrum of f(t) is O (frequency)-4 at infinity. Then Pm(r) is shown to tend to a positive value Pm(0) as r -> 0 (neighbouring zeros are less strongly repelled). Upper and lower bounds for Pm(0) (m = 0, 1, 2, 3) are given, and it is shown th at P0(0) is in the neighbourhood of 1.155^ m ( - 6^ ') . The conjecture of Favreau, Low & Pfeffer (1956) according to which in one case P0(t) is a negative exponential, is disproved. In a final section, the accuracy of other approximations suggested by Rice (1945), McFadden (1958), Ehrenfeld et al. (1958) and the present author (1958) are compared and the results are illustrated by computations, the frequency spectrum of f(t) being assumed to have certain ideal forms: a low-pass spectrum, band-pass spectrum, Butterworth spectrum, etc."

Fluctuations of integrals involving I2(t) are discussed in section 3.9. The probability distribution of a sine wave plus a noise current is given in 3.10 and in 3.11 an alternative method of deriving the results of Part III is mentioned.

                "text": "MANY authors-particularly in the physical and engineering sciences-have considered the problem of obtaining the distribution of the time between successive axiscrossings by a stochastic process. This interest dates back to the pioneering work of S. 0. Rice (1945), who developed a series expression and used a very simple approximation for the case of axis-crossings by a stationary normal process. More generally, one may consider the distribution of the time between an axiscrossing and the nth subsequent axis-crossing, or between, say, an upcrossing of the axis and the nth subsequent downcrossing. Problems of this type have been discussed by Longuet-Higgins (1962), with particular reference to the normal case. In particular he obtains series expressions which are variants and generalizations of that given by Rice (1945, equation 3.4-11). For example, Longuet-Higgins calculates (by somewhat heuristic methods) a series for the probability density for the time between an \"arbitrary\" upcrossing of zero to the (r+ l)st subsequent upcrossing. (A precise definition of what is meant by such a density is usually not given in the relevant literature. This difficulty, and one method of overcoming it, will be discussed in Section 2.) The series just referred to may be written in the form"
