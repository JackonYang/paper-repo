The system is intended to rank the large number of syntactic analyses produced by NL grammars according to the frequency of occurrence of the individual rules deployed in each analysis. We discuss a fully automatic procedure for constructing an LR parse table from a unification-based grammar formalism, and consider the suitability of alternative LALR(1) parse table construction methods for large grammars. The parse table is used as the basis for two parsers; a user-driven interactive system that provides a computationally tractable and labor-efficient method of supervised training of the statistical information required to drive the probabilistic parser. The latter is constructed by associating probabilities with the LR parse table directly. This technique is superior to parsers based on probabilistic lexical tagging or probabilistic context-free grammar because it allows for a more context-dependent probabilistic language model, as well as use of a more linguistically adequate grammar formalism. We compare the performance of an optimized variant of Tomita's (1987) generalized LR parsing algorithm to an (efficiently indexed and optimized) chart parser. We report promising results of a pilot study training on 150 noun definitions from the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) and retesting on these plus a further 55 definitions. Finally, we discuss limitations of the current system and possible extensions to deal with lexical (syntactic and semantic) frequency of occurrence."

The models extend methods from probabilistic context-free grammars to lexicalized grammars, leading to approaches in which a parse tree is represented as the sequence of decisions corresponding to a head-centered, top-down derivation of the tree. Independence assumptions then lead to parameters that encode the X-bar schema, subcategorization, ordering of complements, placement of adjuncts, bigram lexical dependencies, wh-movement, and preferences for close attachment. All of these preferences are expressed by probabilities conditioned on lexical heads. The models are evaluated on the Penn Wall Street Journal Treebank, showing that their accuracy is competitive with other models in the literature. To gain a better understanding of the models, we also give results on different constituent types, as well as a breakdown of precision/recall results in recovering various types of dependencies. We analyze various characteristics of the models through experiments on parsing accuracy, by collecting frequencies of various structures in the treebank, and through linguistically motivated examples. Finally, we compare the models to others that have been applied to parsing the treebank, aiming to give some explanation of the difference in performance of the various models."

Experiments on the Wall Street Journal, Switchboard and Broadcast News corpora show improvement in both perplexity and word error rate - word lattice rescoring - over the standard 3-gram language model. The significance of the thesis lies in presenting an original approach to language modeling that uses the hierarchical - syntactic - structure in natural language to improve on current 3-gram modeling techniques for large vocabulary speech recognition."

The parser itself requires very little human intervention, since the information it uses to make parsing decisions is specified in a concise and simple manner, and is combined in a fully automatic way under the maximum entropy framework. The observed running time of the parser on a test sentence is linear with respect to the sentence length. Furthermore, the parser returns several scored parses for a sentence, and this paper shows that a scheme to pick the best parse from the 20 highest scoring parses could yield a dramatically higher accuracy of 93% precision and recall."

We then develop a chart parsing algorithm and with its help a method to compute the prediction probabilities P (wi+1jWi): We suggest useful computational shortcuts followed by a method of training SLM parameters from text data. Finally, we introduce more detailed parametrization that involves non-terminal labeling and considerably improves smoothing of SLM statistical parameters.

The model assigns probability to every joint sequence of words-binary-parse-structure with headword annotation and operates in a left-to-right manner --- therefore usable for automatic speech recognition. The model, its probabilistic parameterization, and a set of experiments meant to evaluate its predictive power are presented; an improvement over standard trigram modeling is achieved."

This represents a 13% decrease in error rate over the best single-parser results on this corpus [9]. The major technical innovation is the use of a \"maximum-entropy-inspired\" model for conditioning and smoothing that let us successfully to test and combine many different conditioning events.

This paper points out that the Penn II treebank representations are of the kind predicted to have such an effect, and describes a simple node relabeling transformation that improves a treebank PCFG-based parser's average precision and recall by around 8%, or approximately half of the performance difference between a simple PCFG model and the best broad-coverage parsers available today. This performance variation comes about because any PCFG, and hence the corpus of trees from which the PCFG is induced, embodies independence assumptions about the distribution of words and phrases. The particular independence assumptions implicit in a tree representation can be studied theoretically and investigated empirically by means of a tree transformation / detransformation process."

We describe an algorithm for using a probabilistic Earley parser and a stochastic context-free grammar (SCFG) to generate word transition probabilities at each frame for a Viterbi decoder. We show that using an SCFG as a language model improves the word error rate from 34.6% (bigram) to 29.6% (SCFG), and the semantic sentence recognition error from from 39.0% (bigram) to 34.1% (SCFG). In addition, we get a further reduction to 28.8% word error by mixing the bigram and SCFG LMs. We also report on our preliminary results from using discourse-context information in the LM."

Probabilities (a) and (b) are computed incrementally in a single left-to-right pass over the input. Our algorithm compares favorably to standard bottom-up parsing methods for SCFGs in that it works efficiently on sparse grammars by making use of Earley's top-down control structure. It can process any context-free rule format without conversion to some normal form, and combines computations for (a) through (d) in a single algorithm. Finally, the algorithm has simple extensions for processing partially bracketed inputs, and for finding partial parses and their likelihoods on ungrammatical inputs."

Some figure of merit is needed by which to compare the likelihood of constituents, and the choice of this figure has a substantial impact on the efficiency of the parser. While several parsers described in the literature have used such techniques, there is little published data on their efficacy, much less attempts to judge their relative merits. We propose and evaluate several figures of merit for best-first parsing, and we identify an easily computable figure of merit that provides excellent performance on various measures and two different grammars."

We contrast two predictive parsing approaches, top-down and left-corner parsing, and find both to be viable. In addition, we find that enhancement with non-local information not only improves parser accuracy, but also substantially improves the search efficiency."

Each production is recognized after its left descendant but before its other descendants. Procedures in this class have occurred frequently in the compiler literature. In this paper a class of grammars, called LC (k) grammars, is defined and shown to be exactly those grammars for which a certain canonical pushdown machine that does left corner parsing is deterministic. A subset of LC(k) grammars, called strong LC(k) grammars, is defined and shown to be those grammars that can be deterministically left corner parsed by a simplified canonical machine. It is shown that when a particular grammatical rewriting procedure is applied to a grammar, the resulting grammar is (strong) LL(k) if and only if the original grammar is (strong) LC(k). This implies that the class of LC(k) languages is identical to the class of LL(k) languages. The syntax directed translations on LC(k) grammars that can be performed by the canonical pushdown machine are also discussed."

The new model is conceptually simpler, and more naturally suited to modeling whole-sentence phenomena, than the conditional ME models proposed to date. By avoiding the chain rule, the model treats each sentence or utterance as a \"bag of features\", where features are arbitrary computable properties of the sentence. The model is unnormalizable, but this does not interfere with training (done via sampling) or with use. Using the model is computationally straightforward. The main computational cost of training the model is in generating sample sentences from a Gibbs distribution. Interestingly, this cost has different dependencies, and is potentially lower than in the comparable conditional ME model."

Most existing statistical language models exploit only the immediate history of a text. To extract information from further back in the document's history, we propose and usetrigger pairsas the basic information bearing elements. This allows the model to adapt its expectations to the topic of discourse. Next, statistical evidence from multiple sources must be combined. Traditionally, linear interpolation and its variants have been used, but these are shown here to be seriously deficient. Instead, we apply the principle of Maximum Entropy (ME). Each information source gives rise to a set of constraints, to be imposed on the combined estimate. The intersection of these constraints is the set of probability functions which are consistent with all the information sources. The function with the highest entropy within that set is the ME solution. Given consistent statistical evidence, a unique ME solution is guaranteed to exist, and an iterative algorithm exists which is guaranteed to converge to it. The ME framework is extremely general: any phenomenon that can be described in terms of statistics of the text can be readily incorporated. An adaptive language model based on the ME approach was trained on theWall Street Journalcorpus, and showed a 32\u201339% perplexity reduction over the baseline. When interfaced to SPHINX-II, Carnegie Mellon's speech recognizer, it reduced its error rate by 10\u201314%. This thus illustrates the feasibility of incorporating many diverse knowledge sources in a single, unified statistical framework."

Aggregate Markov models are classbased bigram models in which the mapping from words to classes is probabilistic. Mixed-order Markov models combine bigram models whose predictions are conditioned on different words. Both types of models are trained by ExpectationMaximization (EM) algorithms for maximum likelihood estimation. We examine smoothing procedures in which these models are interposed between different order n-grams. This is found to significantly reduce the perplexity of unseen word combinations."

                "text": "In recent years formal languages have become a subject of wide interest--from a theoretical point of view in connection with symbolic logic and automata theory, from a practical point of view as input languages for information processing systems. In both cases some processing of these languages enters into the question, generally as a translation into another formal language. Some examples illustrate the possible variation of the circumstances with regard to the origin and meaning of formM languages and to their syntactical structure: languages for describing theorems, sequential circuits, differential equations systems or numerical algorithms. However, actual processors constructed for languages whose syntax can be described in the same metalanguage, e.g. Baekus notation [2], have shown remarkable similarities. In our own experience an important general principle in processing formal languages was the cellar principle introduced in 1957 by F. L. Bauer and K. Samelson [4, 5] in the design of a formal language-controlled computer. This principle has been described in [19, 20]. The essential features are as follows: The incoming information is analyzed sequentially, the meaning of each symbol already being established insofar as it can be determined from previous history. Corresponding information is stored into a state pushdown store, the \"cellar.\" In this way the momentary top levels of the cellar always reflect previous histo~T to the extent necessary to analyze the next incoming symbol. This principle proved to be applicable in translating programs from the algorithmic language ALGOL [3, 17] into machine code (pilot ALGOL 58 translator of the ZMMD group for the Zuse Z22, ERMETH and PERM computer) or into a computer-oriented, macro instruction language (logical plans of the ALCOR group in 1.959 and 1960). The principle was found and used independently elsewhere. Processors for other formal languages have been built, using a similar technique [7, 18]."
