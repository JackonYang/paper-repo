It is suggested that there may exist motion-sensitive cells in the visual system which operate on the optical flow over the retina, and, in so doing, structure the visual field in terms of distinct surfaces that move and/or lie at varying distances from the observer. First, concepts of static and dynamic perspective relative to a sphere centered about the eye are developed, partly on the basis of the work of Gordon. It is pointed out that the velocity flow pattern has a very simple form making it amenable to analysis by relatively low-level mechanisms. Next a higher-order variable of optical flow, the \u2018convexity\u2019, is defined; under the assumption of a rigid environment, convexity is shown to be related to relative depth. It is then postulated that velocity-sensitive cells having center\u2014surround organization could be linked in such a way as to define a higher-order cell, the convexity cell, having functional properties that make it sensitive to the convexity function. The response profile of a layer of such cells would provide an efficient structuring of the visual field in terms of distinct optical surfaces. Relevant evidence is briefly discussed. Lastly, the optical flow patterns corresponding to rotations of the observer are considered. It is shown that the convexity cell is insensitive to rotations and in consequence responds in an invariant fashion to aspects of the optical flow which are related to the surrounding environment."

                "text": "Motion parallax is the optical change of the visual field of an observer which results from a change of his viewing position. It is often denned as the set of \"apparent motions\" of stationary objects which arise during locomotion. Psychologists assert that it is a \"cue\" for perceiving the depth of the objects, but the optical fact of motion parallax must be distinguished from its capacity to induce perceptions. It has not been experimentally demonstrated that motions in the field of view will actually yield corresponding judgments of depth. This is a purely psychological problem. The optics of motion parallax, on the other hand, is a problem for geometry and ecology. Recently, the suggestion has been made that a continuous gradient of motions in the field of view will induce the perception of slant-depth (J. J. Gibson, Olum, \u2022& Rosenblatt, 1955) inasmuch as the perception of depth is intimately connected with the perception of surfaces (J. J. Gibson, ^950). This statement also needs experimental test. The purpose of the present study is to investigate what kinds of motion in the light entering an eye do in fact consistently arouse certain judgments of depth, and what do not. The experiments must be carried out with artificial motions in a field of view rather than those obtained 1 This work was supported by the Office of Naval Research under Contract NONR 401 (14) with Cornell University.

The variables of size, density, linear perspective, differential blur, and binocular parallax should be eliminated or so reduced as to be ineffective in the array of light entering O's eye. A method of achieving this result has been devised, and a suitable control employed. The experimental method should also preclude actual movement or locomotion of 0. If the cue of motion parallax is so defined as to require active head movement or locomotion, proprioceptive and vestibular stimulation is also present. This definition is unjustified, since passive locomotion in trains and airplanes should be admitted as circumstances when motion parallax occurs. Certain patterns of motion in the field of view of 0 do induce impressions of being moved through space if we accept as evidence the illusions of locomotion obtained in viewing a panoramic motion picture, or in a training device for simulating aerial flight."

It is shown that the interpretive scaling of visual angle is a key factor in size, distance, and motion estimation. The analysis of the velocity-vector pattern indicates that, contrary to the motion-parallax cue to distance suggested by Helmholtz, the pattern would not reveal distance, particularly on a curved trajectory. It is pointed out that the angular acceleration of an environmental point, seen by a moving eye, increases as the square of velocity. The consequences of this interesting relationship for the perception of speed are indicated.

The author has analyzed the computations performed in the course of visual motion analysis. Workable schemes able to perform certain tasks performed by the visual system have been constructed and used as vehicles for investigating the problems faced by the visual system and its methods for solving them.Two major problems are treated: first, the correspondence problem, which concerns the identification of image elements that represent the same object at different times, thereby maintaining the perceptual identity of the object in motion or in change. The second problem is the three-dimensional interpretation of the changing image once a correspondence has been established.The author's computational approach to visual theory makes the work unique, and it should be of interest to psychologists working in visual perception and readers interested in cognitive studies in general, as well as computer scientists interested in machine vision, theoretical neurophysiologists, and philosophers of science."

                "text": "An introduction is given to a theory of early visual information processing. The theory has been implemented, and examples are given of images at various stages of analysis. It is argued that the first step of consequence is to compute a primitive but rich description of the grey-level changes present in an image. The description is expressed in a vocabulary of kinds of intensity change (EDGE, SHADING-EDGE, EXTENDED-EDGE, LINE, BLOB etc.). Modifying parameters are bound to the elements in the description, specifying their POSITION, ORIENTATION, TERMINATION points, CONTRAST, SIZE and FUZZINESS. This description is obtained from the intensity array by fixed techniques, and it is called the primal sketch. For most images, the primal sketch is large and unwieldy. The second important step in visual information processing is to group its contents in a way that is appropriate for later recognition. From our ability to interpret drawings with little semantic content, one may infer the presence in our perceptual equipment of symbolic processes that can define \"place-tokens\" in an image in various ways, and can group them according to certain rules. Homomorphic techniques fail to account for many of these grouping phenomena, whose explanations require mechanisms of construction rather than mechanisms of detection. The necessary grouping of elements in the primal sketch may be achieved by a mechanism that has available the processes inferred from above, together with the ability to select items by first order discriminations acting on the elements' parameters. Only occasionally do these mechanisms use downward-flowing information about the contents of the particular image being processed. It is argued that \"non-attentive\" vision is in practice implemented by these grouping operations and first order discriminations acting on the primal sketch. The class of computations so obtained differs slightly from the class of second order operations on the intensity array. The extraction of a form from the primal sketch using these techniques amounts to the separation of figure from ground. It is concluded that most of the separation can be carried out by using techniques that do not depend upon the particular image in question. Therefore, figure-ground separation can normally precede the description of the shape of the extracted form. Up to this point, higher-level knowledge and purpose are brought to bear on only a few of the decisions taken during the processing. This relegates the widespread use of downward-flowing information to a later stage than is found in current machine-vision programs, and implies that such knowledge should influence the control of, rather than interfering with, the actual data-processing that is taking place lower down."

                "text": "The performance of successfully landing an airplane is generally supposed to be dependent on the ability to perceive visual depth and distance, or more generally space. The classical explanation of human ability to see space is that the eye provides a set of cues to the distance of a given object, and likewise differential cues to the different distances of different objects. Such cues, include (a) binocular parallax or disparity, (b) linear perspective, including the apparent size of objects whose real size is known, (c) aerial perspective, superposition, shading, and (d) motion parallax, i.e. the apparent movement of physically stationary objects relative to one another and to the observer. The last depends upon motion of the observer, usually locomotion, and the strength of the effect is in proportion to the velocity of the observer. Consequently it ought to be of particular significance for spatial judgments during aircraft landings, in which locomotion occurs at a considerabe velocity. The aim of this report is: (1) to examine the existing definitions of motion parallax; (2) to show that they are not sufficiently general to cover the visual situation during aircraft landing; (3) to formulate geometrically a somewhat different principle (called motion perspective); and (4) to apply this general principle to the problem of perceiving the ground and one's relation to it during descent."

In the final product the tantalum is passivated, as by thermal oxidation, so that the said film is substantially tantalum oxide throughout, except where such film underlies a pair of conductive terminal pads. The terminal pads are spaced on the substrate, so that the resistive path therebetween is defined through the nickel-chromium thin film - via the thin metallic tantalum film interfacing between the nickel-chromium film and conductive pads. The overlying tantalum oxide provides a very high degree of environmental protection with respect to the Ni-Cr film, whereby the product not only displays the desirably low TCR characteristics of Ni-Cr, but is also highly resistant to moisture and other environmental factors. The product also exhibits outstanding resistance to the adverse effects of electrolysis supported by the presence of moisture. The various films, including a gold film from which the terminal pads are derived, may be deposited upon the inert substrate by sequential sputtering during a single evacuation of a vacuum chamber. Desired resistive patterns may then be formed by photo-etching, subsequent to which oxidation of accessible portions of the tantalum film can be effected by heating in an appropriate atmosphere."
