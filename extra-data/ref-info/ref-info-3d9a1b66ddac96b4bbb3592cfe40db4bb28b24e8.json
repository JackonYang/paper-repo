                "text": "Few approaches to automated facial recognition have employed geometric measurement of characteristic features of a human face. Eye spacing measurement has been identified as an important step in achieving this goal. Measurement of spacing has been made by application of the Hough transform technique to detect the instance of a circular shape and of an ellipsoidal shape which approximate the perimeter of the iris and both the perimeter of the sclera and the shape of the region below the eyebrows respectively. Both gradient magnitude and gradient direction were used to handle the noise contaminating the feature space. Results of this application indicate that measurement of the spacing by detection of the iris is the most accurate of these three methods with measurement by detection of the position of the eyebrows the least accurate. However, measurement by detection of the eyebrows' position is the least constrained method. Application of these techniques has led to measurement of a characteristic feature of the human face with sufficient accuracy to merit later inclusion in a full package for automated facial recognition."

The first of these tested subjects' ability to reconstruct photographs of faces made up of features randomly selected from the Kit. Two presentation procedures were examined: either the stimulus face was present throughout the reconstruction, or it was reconstructed from memory. The face present condition produced better reconstructions than did the memory condition, though both were far from perfect. Subjects (encoders) who had performed relatively well or badly on the memory condition in Expt. I were used in Expt. II which was concerned with the ease with which Photo-fit reconstructions of a photographed real face could be identified (decoded) by other subjects. The overall success rate was quite low, but the reconstructions of good encoders were more easily recognized than were those of poor encoder subjects."

Evidence is reviewed which suggests that lateralization is important at all stages of processing a face. Early visuospatial processing, and the creation and comparison of facial representations, appear to be carried out more efficiently by the right hemisphere. Comparisons based on discrete, namable features of faces may yield a left hemisphere advantage. It is also proposed that faces may activate semantic information, including names, more efficiently in the left hemisphere. The model is useful in resolving inconsistencies in the degree and direction of asymmetries found in face-recognition tasks. Suggestions are also made for future research."
