Our analysis is for worst-case situations, i.e., we make no assumptions about the way the sequence of bits to be predicted is generated. We measure the performance of the algorithm by the difference between the expected number of mistakes it makes on the bit sequence and the expected number of mistakes made by the best expert on this sequence, where the expectation is taken with respect to the randomization in the predictions. We show that the minimum achievable difference is on the order of the square root of the number of mistakes of the best expert, and we give efficient algorithms that achieve this. Our upper and lower bounds have matching leading constants in most cases. We then show how this leads to certain kinds of pattern recognition/learning algorithms with performance bounds that improve on the best results currently known in this context. We also extend our analysis to the case in which log loss is used instead of the expected number of mistakes."

It is assumed that the learner has reason to believe that one of some pool of known algorithms will perform well but does not know which one. A simple and effective method, based on weighted voting, is introduced for constructing a compound algorithm in such a circumstance. It is called the weighted majority algorithm and is shown to be robust with respect to errors in the data. Various versions of the weighted majority algorithm are discussed, and error bounds for them that are closely related to the error bounds of the best algorithms of the pool are proved.<<ETX>>"

                "text": "We consider a problem of learning from examples. In each of a sequence of trials the learner observes an instance to be classified and must respond with a prediction of its correct classification. Following the prediction the learner is told the correct response. We consider the two category case, and work for the most part with instances composed of a number of Boolean attributes or, more generally, chosen from (0, 1) $\\sp{n}$. Initially, we assume that the correct response in each trial is a function of the corresponding instance, this target function being chosen from some target class of $\\{0,1\\}$-valued functions. We relax this assumption somewhat later. \nWe focus on evaluation of on-line predictive performance, counting the number of mistakes made by the learner during the learning process. For certain target classes we have found algorithms for which we can prove excellent mistake bounds, using no probabilistic assumptions. In the first part of the dissertation we study the properties of such worst-case mistake bounds. \nIn the central part of this dissertation, we present a group of linear-threshold algorithms that are particularly well suited to circumstances in which most of the attributes of the instances are irrelevant to determining the correct predictions. For target classes that can be handled by these algorithms, we show that the worst-case mistake bounds grow only logarithmically with the number of irrelevant attributes. We demonstrate that these algorithms have some measure of robustness in the face of anomalies in the training data caused, for example, by noise. \nWe also consider the implications of on-line, worst-case mistake bounds for learning in a batch setting with probabilistic assumptions, making use of the probabilistic PAC-learning model introduced by Valiant (Va184). We present an analysis that shows that a straightforward transformation applied to mistake bounded algorithms, consisting of adding a hypothesis testing phase, produces algorithms that have asymptotically optimal PAC-learning bounds for certain target classes."

We consider a setting in which the learner responds to each example according to a current hypothesis. Then the learner updates the hypothesis, if necessary, based on the correct classification of the example. One natural measure of the quality of learning in this setting is the number of mistakes the learner makes. For suitable classes of functions, learning algorithms are available that make a bounded number of mistakes, with the bound independent of the number of examples seen by the learner. We present one such algorithm that learns disjunctive Boolean functions, along with variants for learning other classes of Boolean functions. The basic method can be expressed as a linear-threshold algorithm. A primary advantage of this algorithm is that the number of mistakes grows only logarithmically with the number of irrelevant attributes in the examples. At the same time, the algorithm is computationally efficient in both time and space."

Issues are discussed that arise when attempting to determine what a good prediction function is, when those prediction functions make probabilistic assumptions. Learning has at least two purposes: to enable the learner to make predictions in the future and to satisfy intellectual curiosity as to the underlying cause of a process. Two results related to these distinct goals are given. In both cases, the inputs are a countable collection of functions which make probabilistic statements about a sequence of events. One of the results shows how to find one of the functions, which generated the sequence, the other result allows to do as well in terms of predicting events as the best of the collection. In both cases the results are obtained by evaluating a function based on a tradeoff between its simplicity and the accuracy of its predictions.<<ETX>>"

For example, an assistant that helps schedule a particular user\u2019s calendar will have to know that user\u2019s scheduling preferences. This paper explores the potential of machine learning methods to automatically create and maintain such customized knowledge for personal software assistants. We describe the design of one particular learning assistant: a calendar manager, called CAP (Calendar APprentice), that learns user scheduling preferences from experience. Results are summarized from approximately five user-years of experience, during which CAP has learned an evolving set of several thousand rules that characterize the scheduling preferences of its users. Based on this experience, we suggest that machine learning methods may play an important role in future personal software assistants."

This is due, in part, to the high cost of developing and maintaining customized knowledge bases. The construction of personal assistants as learning apprentices -- interactive assistants that learn continually from their users -- is one approach which could dramatically reduce the cost of knowledge-based advisors. We present one such personal learning apprentice, called CAP, which assists in managing a meeting calendar. CAP has been used since June 1991 by a secretary in our work place to manage a faculty member's meeting calendar and is the first instance of a fielded learning apprentice in routine use. This paper describes the organization of CAP, its performance in initial field tests, and more general lessons learned from this effort about learning apprentice systems."
