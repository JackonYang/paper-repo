Having more visual areas probably increases visual abilities, perhaps in part by allowing more stimulus parameters to be considered. Proposals that each visual area computes and thereby detects a specific stimulus attribute have so far dealt with attributes that most mammals can detect and thus do not relate to the issue of species differences in numbers of areas. The problem of forming and maintaining complex patterns of interconnections between many different sets of distinct processing models within an area may limit multiplying functions within a field. In addition, the adding of new visual areas is a way of avoiding constraints on modifying existing visual areas that are imposed by the ongoing functional requirements. Thus, increasing the number of visual or other cortical areas is an effective and apparently common mechanism for evolving new capacities."

Coronal sections from each of the brains were analyzed for location of silver grains and HRP\u2010filled neurons. There are five main results: (1) all corticocortical connections among visual areas are reciprocal. (2) Each cortical visual area has a unique set of cortical connections; the cortical targets of no two cortical visual areas are identical. (3) There is a vast and complicated pattern of connections among the visual areas which implies that there are numerous parallel circuits which run through any one visual area. (4) The connections among the cortical visual areas link retinotopically similar loci and are consistent with the visuotopic maps which microelectrode recording experiments have provided. (5) The connections among visual cortical areas often originate from, or terminate in, discontinuous patches within each area; this result obtains not only for areas 17, 18, 19, and posteromedial lateral suprasylvian area (PMLS), but for at least 13 other areas as well."

Among these, the prefrontal cortex has traditionally been considered the least understood and most complex. The only point that seems to marshall agreement among basic neuroscientists is that prefrontal functions and operations, acknowledged to be important in human behavior, are less accessible to analysis than are many other areas of the cortex. One reason for this perception may be the lack of an agreed upon anatomical blueprint that firmly establishes the relationship between prefrontal cortex and other, better understood, parts of the brain. However, this circumstance has changed radically in the last decade, and the structure and functions of the frontal lobes, particularly the prefrontal \"silent\" portion, which have intrigued investigators since the last century (Ferrier 1886, Bianchi 1895, Franz 1907), have recently again become the subject of intense interest (for reviews, see Damasio 1979, Fuster 1980, Goldman-Rakic 1984, 1987, Milner et al 1985, Mesulam 1986, Ingvar 1983, Stuss & Benson 1984). The availability of solid new findings in experimental animals and human patients and the promise of further discoveries are undoubtedly the basis of this renewed interest. Several extraordinarily influential papers paved the way for the modern era of frontal lobe research. Without a doubt, anatomical studies of pre\u00ad frontal cortex were stimulated by Nauta's 1971 paper on \"The Problem of the Frontal Lobe: A Reinterpretation.\" This review made an indelible impression both for its eloquence and fundamental validity, suggesting as"

Cortical connections were assigned to specific visual areas on the basis of their relationship to the pattern of interhemispheric connections, revealed by staining for degeneration following callosal transection. MT was shown to be reciprocally connected with many topographically organized cortical visual areas, including V1, V2, V3, and V4. These pathways link regions representing corresponding portions of the visual field in the different areas. In addition, MT has reciprocal connections with two previously unidentified cortical areas, which we have designated the medial superior temporal area (MST) and the ventral intraparietal area (VIP). The laminar distribution of terminals and cell bodies in cortical areas connected with MT follows a consistent pattern. In areas V1, V2, and V3, the projections to MT arise largely or exclusively from cells in supragranular layers, and the reciprocal connections from MT terminate mainly in supragranular and infragranular layers. In contrast, the projections to MST and VIP terminate mainly in layer IV, and the reciprocal pathways originate from cells in both superficial and deep layers. On the basis of this pattern, each connection can be designated as forward or feedback in nature, and a hierarchical arrangement of visual areas can be determined. In this hierarchy, MT is at a higher level than V1, V2, and V3, and at a lower level than MST and VIP. Subcortical projections were seen from MT to the claustrum, the putamen, the caudate nucleus, the inferior and lateral subdivisions of the pulvinar complex, the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, the superior colliculus, and the pontine nuclei."

MT is a small, elliptically shaped area on the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus which can be identified by its direct inputs from striate cortex and by its distinctive pattern of heavy myelination. Its average surface area is 33 mm2, which is less than 3% of the size of striate cortex. It contains a complete, topographically organized representation of the contralateral visual hemifield. There are substantial irregularities in the detailed pattern of topographic organization, however, and the representation is significantly more complex than that found for MT in other primates. Much of MT is devoted to the representation of central visual fields, with the emphasis on central vision being similar to that found in striate cortex."

                "text": "The neuronal processes that lead to visual perception have attracted intense interest since Kuffier's studies of receptive field organization in cat retinal ganglion cells over three decades ago (Kuffier 1953). A variety of ana\u00ad tomical and physiological approaches have been employed to analyze the organization of thc visual pathway between the retina and striate cortex (VI ) and the transformations of visual information that occur at each stage (see Hubel & Wiesel 1977, Stone 1 983, Shapley & Lennie 1985). The growth in understanding of the retinostriate pathway has been accompanied by increasing interest in visual processing in the expanse of extrastriate cortex beyond V I . Studies of extrastriate cortex in many spec\u00ad ies showed that it comprises a mosaic of visual areas that can be dis\u00ad tinguished by several anatomical and physiological criteria (reviewed by Kaas 1 978, Zeki 1 978, Cowey 1979, Van Essen 1 979, 1985, Wagor et al 1980, Tusa et al 1 98 1) . The literature in this field is large, and we do not attempt to review all relevant studies. Rather, we concern ourselves with three recent devel\u00ad opments that have yielded insight into information processing and flow within extrastriate cortex. The first of these is the convergence of ana tom-"

Single injections of 3H-proline into striate cortex produce 8-9 discrete projection fields in the belt of cortex surrounding area 17. The number and arrangement of these fields closely resemble the pattern of extrastriate visual areas in the rat. The callosal pattern is also very similar to that in the rat, and provides a set of landmarks for the location of the striate-recipient zones. Thus, cortical regions containing dense aggregations of callosal cells and terminations surround totally or partially the sparsely callosal striate-recipient zones. By comparing our results with previous accounts of the rat visual plan, we were able to identify in lateral extrastriate cortex of the mouse areas anterolateral (AL), lateromedial (LM), laterointermediate (LI), laterolateral (LL), posterolateral (PL), and posterior (P). We also observed 1-2 projections fields into anteromedial (AM) extrastriate cortex, and one field (S) into the posteromedial border of the head representation in primary somatosensory cortex. Our results support the notions that the visual cortex in the mouse is subdivided into multiple visual areas, and that these areas are arranged according to a plan that is common in rodents."

Among the multiple extrastriate visual areas in monkey cerebral cortex, several areas within the superior temporal sulcus (STS) are selectively related to visual motion processing. In this series of experiments we have attempted to relate this visual motion processing at a neuronal level to a behavior that is dependent on such processing, the generation of smooth-pursuit eye movements. 2. We studied two visual areas within the STS, the middle temporal area (MT) and the medial superior temporal area (MST). For the purposes of this study, MT and MST were defined functionally as those areas within the STS having a high proportion of directionally selective neurons. MST was distinguished from MT by using the established relationship of receptive-field size to eccentricity, with MST having larger receptive fields than MT. 3. A subset of these visually responsive cells within the STS were identified as pursuit cells--those cells that discharge during smooth pursuit of a small target in an otherwise dark room. Pursuit cells were found only in localized regions--in the foveal region of MT (MTf), in a dorsal-medial area of MST on the anterior bank of the STS (MSTd), and in a lateral-anterior area of MST on the floor and the posterior bank of the STS (MST1). 4. Pursuit cells showed two characteristics in common when their visual properties were studied while the monkey was fixating. Almost all cells showed direction selectivity for moving stimuli and included the fovea within their receptive fields. 5. The visual response of pursuit cells in the several areas differed in two ways. Cells in MTf preferred small moving spots of light, whereas cells in MSTd preferred large moving stimuli, such as a pattern of random dots. Cells in MTf had small receptive fields; those in MSTd usually had large receptive fields. Visual responses of pursuit neurons in MST1 were heterogeneous; some resembled those in MTf, whereas others were similar to those in MSTd. This suggests that the pursuit cells in MSTd and MST1 belong to different subregions of MST."

Until recently, however, little was known about the origins of the cortical projections to the entorhinal cortex, and most of the available information is still based on degeneration studios. We have carried out a systematic analysis of these connections by placing small injections of the retrograde tracer wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase into each of the fields of the entorhinal cortex of the Macaca fascicularis monkey, Retrograde labeled cells were observed in several areas of the frontal and temporal lobes, the insula, and the cingulate cortex. In the frontal lobe, the greatest number of labeled cells were observed in the orbital region and specifically in areas 13 and 13a: labeled cells were also seen in areas 14, 11, and 12. In the dorsolateral frontal cortex, labeled cells were observed mainly in the rostral half of area 46; occasionally cells were also seen in areas 9, 8, and 6. In the cingulate cortex, labeled cells were observed in area 25, area 32, and rostral levels of area 24; fewer cells were observed at caudal levels of area 24 or in area 23. The retrosplenial region (areas 30 and 29), including its caudal extension along the rostral calcarine sulcus and its ventral extension into the temporal lobe, contained numerous labeled cells. In the temporal lobe, retrogradely labeled cells were arranged in two rostrocaudally oriented bands. Rostral to the hippocampal formation, the first band encompassed the priform and periamygdaloid cortices and areas 35 and 36; the labeling in area 36 was continuous to the temporal pole. At more caudal levels this band was located immediately lateral to the hippocampal formation and included areas 35 and 36 rostrally and areas TH and TF caudally. The second band was situated in the superior temporal gyrus where labeled cells were observed in several distinct cytoarchitectonic fields, including the parainsular cortex in the fundus of the inferior limiting sulcus. In the insula proper, retrogradely labeled cells were seen mainly in the rostral or agranular division; far fewer were observed in the dysgranular and granular insula. Whereas there is little available physiological information concerning many of the cortical regions that project to the entorhinal cortex, on anatomical grounds they may be generally characterized as poly sensory associational regions."

Single injections of HRP were made through recording micropipettes into nine different visual areas. In 15 cortical areas the laminar distribution of neurons which were retrogradely filled with HRP was plotted. In this way we determined the laminar origins of the cortical projections to the nine separate cortical visual areas which were injected. There are three major observations. First, areas 17 and 18 are the only two visual areas in which layers II and III are the primary site of cortically projecting cells; in the other 13 areas the deeper layers of cortex provide a large percentage of such neurons. Second, within any one cortical area, cortically projecting neurons may be distributed among different layers; the specific layer depends upon the cortical target of those neurons. Third, any one cortical area receives projections from several different cortical layers, the specific layers being dependent upon the area from which the projection originates. An individual cortical area, therefore, contributes to several different cortical visual circuits, with each of these circuits defined by the laminar connections of its neurons."

There were major differences in the distribution of cells pro\u2010 jecting to the caudal and rostral parts of area 8. The majority (53%) of labeled cortical cells projecting to caudal regions were in visual association areas, and an additional 23% were in the ventral bank of the intraparietal sulcus, where neurons may have predominantly visual and visuomotor properties. In contrast, rostral area 8 had a much lower percentage of its cortical input originating in visual association areas (5%) or in the ventral bank ofthe intraparietal sulcus (8%). After HRP injection in this rostral part, 21% of labeled cells were in auditory association areas and 13% in paralimbic regions, whereas labeling in these two types of cortex was negligible after HRP administration to caudal parts of area 8. The percentage of cells in other association regions (portions of the banks of the superior temporal sulcus, dorsolateral parietal, medial parietal, and prefrontal cortices) was higher in the rostral (53%) than in the caudal case (21%). The results suggest that caudal area 8 may be involved in head and eye movements in response to visual stimuli, while its anterior subdivisions may be involved in directing the head and eyes in response to auditory stimuli. Furthermore, limbic input may also be relevant to the neural processing occurring in rostral frontal eye fields, perhaps by directing attention toward motivationally relevant stimuli."

                "text": "1. The topographic organization of prestriate visual cortex in the rhesus monkey has been studied both anatomically, by determining the pattern of termination of fibres passing through the corpus callosum, and physiologically, in the same animals, by plotting receptive field positions for different recording sites. Results are displayed on two\u2010dimensional, \"unfolded\" maps of the cortex in the dorsal half of the occipital lobe. 2. Transcallosal fibres terminate in a narrow strip of cortex along the boundary between striate and prestriate areas and in a separate, broader, zone occupying much of the anterior bank of the lunate sulcus, the annectant gyrus, and the parietooccipital sulcus. The detailed pattern of inputs is highly complicated but shows considerable similarities from one animal to the next. 3. Physiological recordings confirmed earlier reports that regions where transcallosal fibres terminate correspond to representations of the vertical meridian in the visual field. This relationship is most precise along the striate\u2010prestriate boundary and along the boundary of area V3 farthest from V1; it is less precise within area V4, where the pattern of transcallosal inputs is more complex. 4. A distinct, topographically organized visual area, named V3A, was found in the region between areas V3 and V4 in the lunate and parieto\u2010occipital sulci. Area V3A differs from V2 and V3 in that both superior and inferior visual quadrants are represented in a single region of the dorsal occipital lobe. 5. The contralateral visual field is represented in a suprisingly complex fashion in areas V3A and V4. Within each area there are multiple representations of some, but perhaps not all, parts of the visual hemifield. It is unclear whether V3A and V4 should be more appropriately considered as sets of distinct sub\u2010areas, each representing only a portion of the hemifield, or as larger areas with complicated internal topographies. 6. Most cells in areas V2, V3 and V3A are orientation selective but not selective for stimulus colour or direction of movement. In contrast, area V4 contains a higher incidence of colour selective cells and a lower incidence of orientation selectivity. These results support the notion of a functional division of labour within the prestriate cortex."

                "text": "An investigation of the architectonic organization and intrinsic connections of the prefrontal cortex was conducted in rhesus monkeys. Cytoarchitectonic analysis indicates that in the prefrontal cortex there are two trends of gradual change in laminar characteristics that can be traced from limbic periallocortex towards isocortical areas. The stepwise change in laminar features is characterized by the emergence and gradual increase in the width of granular layer IV, by an increase in the size of pyramidal cells in layers III and V, and by a higher cell\u2010packing density in the supragranular layers. Myeloarchitectonic analysis reveals that the limbic areas are poorly myelinated, adjacent areas have a diffuse myelin content confined to the deep layers, and in isocortices the myelinated fibers are distributed in organized horizontal bands (of Baillarger) and a vertical plexus. Using the above architectonic criteria, we observed that one of the architectonic trends takes a radial basoventral course from the periallocortex in the caudal orbitofrontal region to the adjacent proisocortex and then to area 13. The next stage of architectonic regions includes orbital areas 12, 11, and 14, which is followed by area 10, lateral area 12, and the rostral part of ventral area 46. The last group includes the caudal part of ventral area 46 and ventral area 8. The other trend takes a mediodorsal course from the periallocortex around the rostral portion of the corpus callosum to the adjacent proisocortical areas 24, 25, and 32 and then to the medially situated isocortical areas 9, 10, and 14. The next stage includes lateral areas 10 and 9 and the rostral part of dorsal area 46. The last group includes the caudal part of dorsal area 46 and dorsal area 8."

We recorded from cortex of awake rhesus monkeys performing a fixation task. Multiunit receptive fields were mapped with small, stationary spots of light to determine borders and points of strongest driving or \u201cactivity centers\u201d of the fields. We found evidence for several distinct subdivisions of this cortex. A representation of the vertical meridian runs across the gyrus, and two crude topographic representations of the central 30 degrees of the lower quadrant, the posteromedial and anterolateral areas (area PM and area AL), share this representation of the meridian. Area AL extends from the prelunate gyrus into the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus; it is separated from the MT area by a narrow strip of cortex. Area PM occupies part of the prelunate gyrus and extends into the anterior bank of the lunate sulcus. Receptive field size in both AL and PM is an increasing function of eccentricity and is similar for the two areas. Medial to areas PM and AL on the prelunate gyrus is another cortical region with qualitatively different topographic organization."

To see whether this pattern bore any relationship to the cytochrome oxidase blobs we made multiple tiny injections of horseradish peroxidase into layers 2 and 3 of area 17, small enough so that some of the injections (or their cores) were entirely inside a single blob, or entirely outside. When the injection centers were entirely in blobs, the label in layers 2 and 3 was transported preferentially to nearby blobs, avoiding nonblob areas. When the injections were in nonblob areas, the label was found predominantly in surrounding nonblob areas, avoiding the blobs. Besides this lateral transport, label was also present in the layers below 2 and 3: the label in layers 4 and 6 was very restricted, occupying roughly the diameter of the injection core and presumably representing axons of cell bodies at the injection site; in layer 5 diffusely labeled patches observed the same blob/nonblob segregation seen above layer 4."

Histochemical staining for cytochrome oxidase (CO) in V2 reveals a pattern of alternate thick and thin CO-rich stripes separated by CO-sparse interstripes2,3. These subregions receive distinct inputs from neurones in CO-rich and CO-sparse zones arrayed within the superficial layers of V1 (refs 4,5). Are output projections from V2 to higher visual areas also segregated? Using an anatomical double-label paradigm, we have now demonstrated that V2 cells projecting to two of its major target areas, MT and V4 (refs 6, 7), are arranged in stripe-like clusters which are largely segregated from one another and which are closely related to the pattern of CO stripes. Concomitant electrophysiological recordings from V2 indicate that groups of cells having similar receptive field properties are clustered within the subregions defined by these anatomical techniques."

First, convergence of different modalities into each area was investigated. Areas TS and TAa, in the upper part of this region, were found to receive visual as well as auditory inputs. Areas TPO, PGa, and IPa, in the depths of the STS, received visual, auditory, and somatosensory inputs. Areas TEa, TEm, TE3, TE2, and TE1, which extend from the ventral bank of the STS through the inferior temporal gyrus, were primarily unimodal visual areas. Second, of the cells with visual responses, it was found that some neurons in areas TS-IPa could be activated only by moving visual stimuli, whereas the great majority of neurons in areas TEa-TE1 could be activated by stationary visual stimuli. Third, it was found that there were few sharply discriminating visual neurons in areas TS and TAa; of the sharply discriminating visual neurons in other areas, however, neurons that responded primarily to faces were found predominantly in areas TPO, TEa, and TEm (in which they represented 20% of the neurons with visual responses); neurons that were tuned to relatively simple visual stimuli such as sine-wave gratings, color, or simple shapes were relatively common in areas TEa, TEm, and TE3; and neurons that responded only to complex visual stimuli were common in areas IPa, TEa, TEm, and TE3. These findings show inter alia that areas TPO, PGa, and IPa are multimodal, that the inferior temporal gyrus areas are primarily unimodal, that there are areas in the cortex in the anterior and dorsal part of the STS that are specialized for the analysis of moving visual stimuli, that neurons responsive primarily to faces are found predominantly in areas TPO, TEa, and TEm, and that architectural subdivisions of the temporal lobe cortex are related to neuronal response properties."

                "text": "1. Recordings were made from single neurones, or small clusters of cells, in five prestriate visual areas of rhesus monkey cortex. The cells were studied for their binocularity, as well as for their orientational, motion and colour preferences. In all, 1500 cells were studied, 250 cells for each of the areas V2, V3, V3A and the motion area of the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus, and 500 cells for V4. All the cells referred to in this study can be placed in one prestriate area or another unambiguously. 2. The great majority of cells in all areas were binocularly driven, without monocular preferences. Within each area, there were cells that either preferred binocular stimulation markedly, or were responsive to binocular stimulation only. The ocular interaction histograms for all areas are remarkably similar when tested at a fixed disparity. 3. Over 70% of the cells in areas V2, V3 and V3A were selective for orientation. The receptive fields of cells were larger in V3 and V3A than in V2. By contrast, less than 50% of the cells in V4 and the motion area of the superior temporal sulcus were orientation selective. 4. Directionally selective cells were found in all areas. But they were present in small numbers (less than 15%) in areas V2, V3, V3A and V4. By contrast, 90% of the cells in the motion area of the superior temporal sulcus were directionally selective. 5. 8% of the cells in V2 had opponent colour properties. Cells with such properties were not found in V3, V3A or in the motion area of the superior temporal sulcus. By contrast, 54% of the cells in the V4 complex had opponent colour properties. 6. It is argued that despite its uniformity in cytoarchitectural appearance and in ocular interaction patterns, there is a functional division of labour within the prestriate cortex. Evidence for this is seen not only in the different concentrations of functional cell types in distinct areas of the prestriate cortex, but also in the differential anatomical and callosal connexions of each area."

Analysis of the topographic and laminar organization of these connections reveal that each of these areas has a differential connection pattern both within the parietal lobe and with respect to motor cortex. Area 3 projects predominantly to area 1 via a horizontal, intracortical fiber system which courses through layers III and V without entering the white matter while other efferents of area 3 to areas 2, 3a and second somatosensory cortex (SII) are less dense and course through the white matter. There is no indication that area 3 efferents terminate in areas 4 or 5. In comparison to area 3, area 1 has a wider projection field. Its primary outflow reaches area 2 via a white matter course while moderately strong connections are directed to areas 3a, S II, 4 and supplementary motor cortex (M II) and a minor projection to area 5. Lesions involving the supragranular layers of area 1 demonstrate that efferents from these layers (II\u2010III) travel directly through the cortex to terminate in layer I of area 3 as well as entering the white matter before terminating in area 2 ventral to the tip of the intraparietal sulcus. Finally, area 2 projects primarily to area 5 via both an intracortical fiber system in layers III\u2010V as well as through the white matter. While area 2 also has connections with areas 1, 3a, S II, 6 and M II, it was not observed to project to area 3. In addition, layers I\u2010IV of area 2 ventral to the intraparietal sulcus send a number of horizontally oriented fibers mainly through layer IIIb to terminate in rostral area 7 (area PF of Bonin and Bailey, '47)."

Some of these clusters, but not all, coincide with substructures inside the thick stripes.

Simultaneous injection of each dye in retinotopically corresponding regions of these areas gave rise to two afferent populations of labeled neurons in subcortical and cortical structures which project to both areas. These two populations showed a variable degree of overlap in their spatial distribution. Neurons labeled by both dyes (double-labeled neurons) which, therefore, project to both areas, were found in substantial numbers in these overlap zones. When the injections were made in non- retinotopically corresponding regions in the two areas, both populations of labeled cells overlapped extensively in the cortex but not in subcortical structures, suggesting that the laws governing the topography of these two types of connections are different. In the cortex, the labeled neurons extended from the fundus of the lunate sulcus to the fundus of the superior temporal sulcus. A few labeled neurons were also found in the inferior temporal cortex and the parahippocampal gyrus. In all cortical regions, corticocortical neurons projecting to V1 and V2 were found in both supra- and infragranular layers, although double-labeled neurons were more numerous in infragranular layers. With increasing distance from V1 there was an increase in the proportion of neurons labeled in infragranular layers. The comparative strength of input to V1 and V2 was computed and was found to be higher to V2 in all cortical regions except the superior temporal sulcus which projected equally heavily to both areas. The superior temporal sulcus also stood out in that of all cortical regions it contained the highest proportion of double-labeled neurons. Single- and double-labeled neurons were found in a number of subcortical structures including the lateral geniculate nucleus, the inferior and lateral pulvinar, the intralaminar nuclei, the nucleus basalis of Meynert, and the amygdala. The pattern of labeling in the lateral pulvinar was in agreement with the suggestion that this structure has a complex topographical organization containing at least a dual representation of the visual field (Bender, D. B. (1981) J. Neurophysiol. 46: 672\u2013693). In the pulvinar complex, densities of labeled neurons permitted evaluation of the strength of input to V1 and V2, the latter being the strongest. These results demonstrate that areas V1 and V2 share a vast amount of common input from the same cortical and subcortical structures and that a number of neurons project to both areas via branching axons."

In the same animals, injections of anatomical tracers were placed into electrophysiologically determined sites in area 3b or S-II. Mapping results and patterns of connections were later related to architectonic fields that were delimited in sections cut parallel to the surface of manually flattened cortex and stained for myelin. There were several major results. (1) Recordings from area 3b revealed a characteristic somatotopic organization of foot to face in a mediolateral sequence as previously reported in other members of the marmoset family (Carlson et al., 1986). (2) Multiple injections of WGA-HRP in area 3b demonstrated dense, patchy interconnections with ipsilateral S-II, PV, area 3a, and area 1, less dense interconnections with primary motor cortex (M-I), the supplementary motor area (SMA), limbic cortex of the medial wall (L), and rostrolateral parietal cortex of the lateral sulcus (PR), and callosal connections with areas 3b, S-II, and PV. Injections of 3 different tracers into the representation of 3 body regions in area 3b indicated that the connections with areas 3a, 3b, 1, S-II, and PV are topographically organized. (3) Recordings from cortex on the upper bank of the lateral sulcus demonstrated a somatotopic representation of the body surface that matches that of S-II of other mammals. S-II immediately adjoined areas 3b along the dorsal lip of the lateral sulcus. The face representation in S-II was adjacent to the face representation in 3b while the trunk, hindlimb, and forelimb were represented in a caudorostral sequence deeper in the sulcus. (4) Injections in S-II revealed ipsilateral connections with areas 3a, 3b, 1, a presumptive area 2, PV, PR, M-I, SMA, limbic cortex, the frontal eye fields, and the frontal ventral visual area. Dense callosal connections were with S-II and PV. (5) The recordings also revealed a systematic representation just rostral to S-II that has not been previously described in primates.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Injections of the enzyme were made through a recording micropipette, making it possible to localize the injection site by physiological criteria. We found that layer VI cells projected to the lateral geniculate nucleus, while a distinct population of cells in layer V projected to the superior colliculus. Cells in layers II and III were the major sources of ipsilateral cortico\u2010cortical connections. This pattern of projection was consistent from one visual area to another. Pyramidal cells appeared to be the source of cortico\u2010geniculate, cortico\u2010collicular and cortico\u2010cortical projections. The proportion of cells within a layer that terminated in a given site varied from layer to layer: apparently all of the large pyramids in layer V had terminals in the superior colliculus, about half of the pyramids in layer VI had terminals in the lateral geniculate nucleus, while only a small proportion of the pyramids in layers II and III had terminals in any single cortical area. The results indicated a remarkable specificity in the projections of the cortical layers."

Thus, it is unlikely that they should be fed the same information for further processing, yet both receive a strong input from patches of the upper layers of V2 (refs 10, 11), the area immediately adjoining the primary visual cortex, V1. V2, however, seems to comprise functionally distinct subregions, which can be revealed by staining the tissue for the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome oxidase12\u201315. Here we report that V4 and V5 are connected with separate cytochrome oxidase-defined subregions of V2, suggesting that cortical pathways dealing with motion and colour perception are segregated in their passage through V2, and reinforcing evidence for functional specialization in the visual cortex16\u201318."

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

Remarkably, those portions of striate cortex (V1) and extrastriate cortex that are most immunoreactive for Cat-301 are anatomically interconnected and are dominated by inputs arising from the magnocellular layers of the LGN (which are themselves highly immunoreactive). In particular, we found that a band of Cat-301 labeled neurons known to exist in layer 4 of V1 is centered on the boundary between layers 4C alpha and 4B and thus includes portions of both the primary target of the magnocellular LGN and its subsequent relay through layer 4B. We also demonstrated consistently strong Cat-301 immunoreactivity in all three extrastriate targets of layer 4B: areas V3, MT, and the cytochrome-oxidase (CO) enriched thick stripes of V2. In V2, there was a close correlation between Cat-301 labeling and clusters of cells projecting to MT but not to V4. This was true even in regions where the CO pattern was equivocal or irregular, indicating that Cat-301 is a more reliable marker than CO for the thick-stripe subregions of V2. Finally, we found strong Cat-301 immunoreactivity in at least parts of areas V3A, the MST complex, and the posterior parietal complex, but not in area V4 or inferotemporal cortex. The molecular specificity revealed by this single marker thus correlates with functionally specific subdivisions at each hierarchical level over nearly the entire known extent of the visual pathway in macaques. This supports the notion that these subdivisions form an anatomically, physiologically, and now molecularly distinct pathway known as the M-stream."

Systematic electrode penetrations revealed that there is a functionally distinct region where three classes of directionally selective cells with large receptive fields cluster. This region is anteriorly adjoined to the dorsal two-thirds of MT, has a width of 4\u20135 mm mediolaterally, and therefore may correspond to the dorsal part of the medial superior temporal area (MST), which was previously defined as a MT-recipient zone. One class of cells responded to a straight movement of patterns in the frontoparallel plane with directional selectivity (D cells: 217/422, 51.4%). The second class of cells selectively responded to an expanding or contracting size change of patterns (S cells: 66/422, 15.7%). These cells responded neither to a change in width of a slit of any orientation or any length, nor to a change in brightness. The third class of cells responded only to a rotation of patterns in one direction (R cells: 58/422, 13.7%). A majority of these cells (41/58) responded to the clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of patterns in the frontoparallel plane (Rf cells), while the rest responded to a rotation of patterns in depth (Rd cells). We will suggest that these cells acquire the ability to discover whole events of visual motion-- i.e., unidirectional straight movement, size change (radial movement), and rotation--by integrating elemental motion information extracted by MT cells. The receptive fields of D, S, and Rf cells can be constructed by converging signals of MT cells, the preferred directions of which are arranged in parallel (D cells), radially (S cells), and circularly (Rf cells). The receptive fields of Rd cells can be constructed, in turn, by the convergence of signals of S cells."

                "text": "1. The cortical projections of the foveal and extrafoveal parts of the striate cortex have been compared, using conventional degeneration techniques, as well as combinations of anatomical methods. While both foveal and extrafoveal striate cortex share a common pattern of projections (to areas V2, V3 and the visual area in the medial part of the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus), foveal striate cortex was found to have an additional projection (to part of the cortex of the fourth visual areas, V4). The latter projection includes the posterior lip of the inferior occipital sulcus which, on anatomical grounds, is regarded as the ventral extension of V4. 2. Anatomical studies using double tracers were employed to clarify the nature of the projections from the striate cortex and from V2 to V4. In one such experiment, tritiated proline was injected into extra\u2010foveal striate cortex and a small lesion was made in that part of V2 receiving a direct projection from the region of the striate cortex into which the radioactive tracer was injected. Only degenerating fibres (due to the lesion), and no radioactive label, was found in V4. Such an experiment showed that, unlike foveal striate cortex, the projections from extrafoveal striate cortex to V4 are not direct, but through V2. 3. In another type of anatomical experiment using double tracers, the corpus callosum was sectioned and tritiated proline was injected into foveal striate cortex. Such an experiment allowed a more accurate determination of the extent of V4, as judged from its callosal connexions, to which foveal striate cortex projects. 4. Considering the projections of V1 to areas V2, V3 and the visual area in the medial part of the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus, and considering the differences in the projections of foveal and extrafoveal striate cortex, it is suggested that, among other functions, the striate cortex acts as a distribution centre for the information coming over the retino\u2010geniculo\u2010cortical pathways, parcelling this information out to different visual areas of the prestriate cortex for further analysis."

Primarily on the basis of features observed in Nissl\u2010 and fiber\u2010stained preparations, supplemented with Golgi\u2010stained material and preparations stained for heavy metals by Timm's method and histochemically for acetylcholinesterase, the entorhinal cortex has been divided into seven fields that are named according to their rostrocaudal and mediolateral positions except for one rostrally located field that is named for the prominent input that it receives from the olfactory bulb. At rostral levels, the entorhinal cortex is marked by a number of morphological inhomogeneities. The neurons tend to be organized in patches that are surrounded by large, thick, radially oriented bundles of fibers. At caudal levels, the entorhinal cortex has a more distinctly laminated appearance, reminiscent of that in the neocortex, and most of the neurons and fiber fascicles are arranged in discrete radial columns. The cortical region adjoining the entorhinal cortex laterally, which is commonly known as the \u201cperirhinal cortex,\u201d is in fact composed of two separate fields corresponding to areas 35 and 36 of Brodmann. Area 35 occupies the fundus and part of the lateral aspect of the rhinal sulcus. Area 36 extends from the lateral bank of the rhinal sulcus into the inferior temporal gyrus, where it borders fields TA and TE rostrally, and field TF of the parahippocampal gyrus caudally. The surface extents of each of the entorhinal fields have been determined by making \u201cunfolded\u201d two\u2010dimensional maps of the region and measuring the areas with a computerized digitizing system."

In particular, 0.1-0.3 microliter of 50% HRP or 5% WGA-HRP was injected into various parts of the temporal cortex, i.e. the rostral (TEr), the caudal (TEc), and the most caudal (TEO) parts of the inferotemporal cortex, the superior temporal gyrus, and the temporal pole (TG), and in the upper bank of the inferior arcuate sulcus in the frontal lobe. Labeled cells, which represent cells of origin of association fibers projecting to the injection site, appeared in various cortical regions. The main findings of the present study are the following. The temporal pole (TG) receives fibers almost exclusively from the most rostral part of the TE. The rostral part of the TE receives many fibers from both the caudal part of the TE and the TEO. The caudal part of the TE receives fibers from the TEO, and the TEO from the prestriate cortex (OA and OB). Taking these findings together, the morphological basis of the \"step-wise\" progression of visual impulses from the prestriate cortex to the TEO, TE and finally to the TG is clearly presented. The superior temporal gyrus (TA or area 22) receives most fibers from the dorsolateral frontal gyrus, while the inferotemporal cortex (TE or areas 21 and 20) receives most fibers from the ventrolateral frontal gyrus (inferior frontal convexity). Both the temporal pole (TG) and the inferotemporal cortex (TE) receives a fair number of fibers from the parahippocampal region (TH and TF)."

It has been suggested that this segregation persists through to the highest stages of the visual cortex, and that the pronounced differences between the neuronal response properties in the parietal cortex and inferotemporal cortex may be attributed to differential contributions from magnocellular and parvocellular signals. We have examined this hypothesis directly by recording the responses of cortical neurons while selectively blocking responses in the magnocellular or parvocellular layers of the LGN. Responses were recorded from single units or multiunit clusters in the middle temporal visual area (MT), which is part of the pathway leading to parietal cortex and thought to receive primarily magnocellular inputs. Responses in the MT were consistently reduced when the magnocellular subdivision of the LGN was inactivated. The reduction was almost always pronounced and often complete. In contrast, parvocellular block rarely produced striking changes in MT responses and typically had very little effect. Nevertheless, unequivocal parvocellular contributions could be demonstrated for a minority of MT responses. At a few MT sites, responses were recorded while magnocellular and parvocellular blocks were made simultaneously. Responses were essentially eliminated for all these paired blocks. These results provide direct evidence for segregation of magnocellular and parvocellular contributions in the extrastriate visual cortex and support the suggestion that these signals remain largely segregated through the highest levels of cortical processing."

First, we carried out a quantitative analysis of irregularities and asymmetries in the visual representation in MT. This analysis revealed a striking overemphasis on a restricted portion of the visual field that runs obliquely through the inferior contralateral quadrant and largely avoids both the horizontal meridian and the inferior vertical meridian. This corresponds to the portion of the visual field that would be maximally stimulated during visually guided hand movements. Second, the physiologically determined topographic organization of MT was compared to the pattern of callosal inputs in the same hemisphere, which are known to be distributed irregularly within MT. Callosal inputs tended to be densest near the representation of the vertical meridian, but there were numerous exceptions to this trend. Thus, topographic irregularities account for only part of the irregularities in callosal inputs to MT. Finally, comparison of these data with previous reports shows a strong correlation between body weight and the average size of MT. The representation in myeloarchitectonically defined MT was found to include much of the visual periphery, although it is unclear from our data whether this representation is invariably complete."

The frontal regions injected with HRP extended from the posterior periarcuate region to the frontal pole. The architectonic boundaries of areas containing HRP\u2010labeled neurons were determined from matched sections stained for the visualization of cell bodies, myelin, or acetylcholinesterase. The results showed that the laminar origin of both nearby and distant corticocortical projections was correlated with the architectonic differentiation of the regions giving rise to the projecting afferent fibers. Frontally directed projections from limbic cortices, which show a redimentary laminar organization, emanated mainly from deep layers. On the other hand, projections from increasingly more differentiated cortices arose progressively from the upper (or superagranular) layers. This pattern was observed for projections originating along the axis of architectonic differentiation of the visual, somatosensory, auditory, motor, and preforntal cortical systems. Thus, as the cortical architecture within each system changes from limbic areas toward the primary cortices, the origin of frontally directed projections shifts from predominantly infragranular to predominantly superagranular layers."

                "text": "A study has been made, using Golgi preparations, of the organization of neurons with smooth or sparsely spined dendrites, here called local circuit neurons, of the macaque monkey primary visual cortex. Since these neurons include those responsible for inhibitory circuitry of the cortex, a better understanding of their anatomical organization is essential to concepts of functional organization of the region. This account describes those neurons found with cell body and major dendritic spread within the thalamic recipient zone of lamina 4C and its border zone with lamina 5A. The neurons are grouped firstly in terms of in which laminar division the soma occurred\u2013 4C\u03b2bT, 4C\u03b2aL or the border zone of 5A\u20104C\u03b2bT\u2013and secondly, into varieties on the basis of the interlaminar projection patterns of their axons. Most, if not all, of the local circuit neurons of these divisions have interlaminar axon projections as well as an arbor local to their cell body and dendritic field. These interlaminar projections are highly specific, targeting from one to five laminar divisions depending on the variety of neuron; on this basis 17 varieties of local circuit neuron are described. While the number of varieties appears dauntingly large in terms of understanding the functional circuitry of the region, the clear\u2010cut organization of the interlaminar links may provide clues as to the information processing that concerns each neuron. The local circuit neuron axon projections can be related to a wealth of information already available concerning the laminar organization of afferent axons and efferent cell groups, the organization of spiny neuron intrinsic relays (presumed to be excitatory), and physiological properties of different laminar divisions. It is hoped that the information derived from this study can serve as a guide for correlated physiological\u2010anatomical studies on single cells of the region."

                "text": "Area V4, a visuotopically organized area in prestriate cortex of the macaque, is the major source of visual input to the inferior temporal cortex, known to be crucial for object recognition. To examine the selectivity of cells in V4 for stimulus form, we quantitatively measured the responses of 322 cells to bars varying in length, width, orientation, and polarity of contrast, and sinusoidal gratings varying in spatial frequency, phase, orientation, and overall size. All of the cells recorded in V4 were located on the lower portion of the prelunate gyrus. Receptive fields were located almost exclusively within the representation of the central 5 degrees of the lower visual field, and receptive field size, in linear dimension, was 4-7 times greater than that in the corresponding representation of striate cortex (V1). Nearly all receptive fields consisted of overlapping dark and light zones, like \"classic\" complex fields in V1, but the relative strengths of the dark and light zones often differed. A few cells responded exclusively to light or dark stimuli. Many cells in V4 were selective for stimulus orientation, and a few were selective for direction of motion as well. Although the median orientation bandwidth of the orientation-selective cells (52 degrees) was wider than that reported for oriented cells in V1, approximately 8% of the oriented cells had bandwidths of less than 30 degrees, which is nearly as narrow as the most narrowly tuned cells in V1. The proportion of cells selective for direction of motion (13%) was not markedly different from that reported in V1. The large majority of V4 cells were tuned to the length and width of bars, and the \"shape\" of the optimal bar varied from cell to cell, as has been reported for cells in the dorsolateral visual area (DL) of the owl monkey, a possible homologue of V4 in the macaque. Preferred lengths and widths varied independently from approximately 0.05 to 6 degrees, with the smallest preferred bars about the size of the smallest receptive fields in V1 and the largest preferred bars larger than any fields in V1. The relationship between the size of the optimal bar and the size of the receptive field varied from cell to cell. Some cells, for example, responded best to bars much narrower or shorter than the field, whereas other cells responded best to bars that filled (but did not extend beyond) the excitatory field in the length, width, or both dimensions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

These connections originate from pyramidal neurons concentrated in layers 3 and 5. Terminations occur in all cortical layers, largely coextensive with labeled neurons but more restricted in layer 4. This multilaminar distribution contrasts with the mainly supragranular localization of periodic intrinsic connections in V1 (area 17), and may imply a close interaction, in V2, of periodic intrinsic connections with pulvinocortical, as well as with corticocortical terminations (concentrated, respectively, in layers 3 and 5, and in lower 3 and 4). As in V1, the tangential configuration of these connections in V2 is reticular or latticelike, and is detectable for 2.5\u20133.0 mm from an injection site of HRP, 3H amino acids, or latex beads. Cross\u2010sectional widths of labeled regions vary from 250 to 800 \u03bcm in squirrel monkey and from 400 to 1,000 \u03bcm in macaque, depending on which portion of the lattice is measured. When periodic intrinsic connections are compared with stripes labeled histochemically by cytochrome oxidase (CO), no clear relationship is obvious between the two systems. This result contrasts with the orderly tangential alignment reported between CO\u2010reactive zones in V2 and certain extrinsic connections; namely, pulvinocortical terminations (Livingstone and Hubel, '82) and clusters of neurons projecting to area V4 (DeYoe and Van Essen, '84). Other extrinsic connections, however, such as backgoing connections from V2 to V1, do not seem to have a periodic distribution. Thus, although some discontinuous cortical connections relate to each other in a precise mosaic fashion, intrinsic and some extrinsic connections may observe different modes of organization."

It receives a convergent retinotopic projection from several visual cortical ares, including areas 17, 18, 19, 21a and PMLS (posteromedial lateral suprasylvian area). The projection arises from spiny dendrite cells (pyramidal and fusiform) in the middle of cortical layer VI. As shown by a double label experiment, they form a separate population from those projecting to the lateral geniculate nucleus. There are also inputs from the lateral hypothalamus, from the nucleus centralis thalami, and probably from the locus coeruleus, but not from the sensory nuclei of the thalamus. Non-visual cortical areas do not project to the visual claustrum, but many of them are connected to other parts of the nucleus. For example, the splenial (cingulate) gyrus projects to a claustral zone just ventral to the visual area, and regions anterior to the visual area are connected with somatosensory and auditory cortex. The commonest cell type in the claustrum is a large spiny dendrite neuron whose axon leaves the nucleus after giving off local collaterals. Small spine-free cells, with beaded dendrites and a locally arborizing axon, are found also. Electron microscopy of the claustrum after ablation of the visual cortex showed degenerating type 1 axon terminals synapsing on spines and beaded dendrites, suggesting a direct cortical input to both cell types. The visual claustrum projects back to the visual cortex, to the same areas from which it receives an input. The return projection is predominantly ipsilateral, but there is, in addition, a small crossed projection. The claustrocortical axons terminate in all cortical layers but most heavily in layers IV and VI. The majority of the cells in the visual claustrum project to the cortex, and retinotopy is maintained throughout the entire corticoclaustral loop. No subcortical projections from the claustrum could be identified."

                "text": "We continue an investigation of the organization of local circuit neurons (largely inhibitory, GABAergic neurons, with smooth or sparsely spined dendrites) in the primary visual cortex of macaque monkey (Lund, '87: J. Comp. Neurol. 257:60\u201392; Lund et al., '88: J. Comp. Neurol. 276:1\u201329). This account covers local circuit neurons of layers 4B, 4A, and 3B; these three layers each receive different intrinsic second\u2010order relays of principal thalamic inputs as well as receiving primary thalamic inputs in the case of two of the three laminae (4A and 3B). The study shows the existence of a number of different local circuit neurons making interlaminar projections between 4B, 4A, and 3B; each provides specific cross links between different combinations of the three laminae. It is known that the functional properties recorded physiologically from layers 4B, 4A, and 3B differ from one another and so these anatomical cross links may allow for correlation between different attributes of visual stimuli, e.g., color or motion, while still enabling separate processing of these different attributes to proceed in each of the three layers and be passed on to extrastriate areas. Whereas no spine\u2010bearing neurons of layers 4B, 4A, or 3B provide \u201cfeedback\u201d circuits to layer 4C (the source of their major intrinsic excitatory afferents), some of the local circuit neurons provide precisely structured axon feedback projections to divisions of 4C. The local circuit neurons also project to either lamina 5 or lamina 6, but not both and to superficial layers 3A, 2, and 1. Some local circuit neuron axon projections are of a dimension that would be confined to single functional clusters, e.g., cytochrome\u2010rich \u201cblobs,\u201d others reach out far enough to contact nearest neighbor \u201cunlike\u201d functional clusters, and yet others spread far enough to link repeating clusters of single function."

An analysis of receptive field locations for extensive arrays of closely placed recording sites in parietal cortex which were later related to cortical architecture led to the following conclusions: (1) There are two large systematic representations of the body surface within \u201cSI\u201d. Each is activated by low threshold cutaneous stimuli; one representation is coextensive with Area 3b and the other with Area 1. (2) While each of these representations contain regions of cortex with topological or \u201csomatotopic\u201d transformations of skin surface, the representations have many discontinuities where adjoining skin surfaces are adjoining in the representations. Thus, the representations can be considered as composites of somatotopically organized regions, but cannot be accurately depicted by simple continuous homunculi. Lines of discontinuity often cut across dermatomes and seldom follow dermatomal boundaries, i.e., neither cutaneous representation constitutes a systematic representation of dermatomal skin fields. (3) While the two cutaneous fields are basically similar in organization and are approximate mirror images of each other, they differ in important details, i.e., lines of discontinuity in the representations and the sites of representations of different specific skin surfaces differ significantly in the two representations. (4) The two cutaneous representations also differ in size and in the relative proportions in each representation differ, they cannot both be simple reflections of overall peripheral innervation density. (5) All or part of Area 2 contains a systematic representation of deep body structures."

Our results show that a topographically organized representation of the superior contralateral quadrant of the visual field lies immediately anterior to the ventral half of V2. This area is organized in a mirror symmetric fashion to ventral V2: it shares a horizontal meridian representation with V2 and a representation of the superior vertical meridian forms its anterior border. A well\u2010defined strip of callosal inputs runs along the vertical meridian representation, thereby providing a reliable anatomical marker for areal boundaries in ventral extrastriate cortex. We refer to this area as the ventral posterior area (VP) because it is, in all these respects, notably similar to VP in the owl monkey. Ventral V2 has strong reciprocal connections with VP, and the topography of the V2 projection agrees closely with the topography revealed in our physiological mapping experiments. The visual field representation in VP is strikingly anisotropic, with linear magnification factor being much larger along contours of constant polar angle than along contours of constant eccentricity."

Area 7a (the caudal part of the posterior parietal lobe) is reciprocally interconnected with multiple visual\u2010related areas: the superior temporal polysensory area (STP) in the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus (STS), visual motion areas in the upper bank of STS, the dorsal prelunate gyrus, and portions of V2 and the parieto\u2010occipital (PO) area. Area 7a is also heavily interconnected with limbic areas: the ventral posterior cingulate cortex, agranular retrosplenial cortex, caudomedial lobule, the parahippocampal gyrus, and the presubiculum. By contrast, the adjacent subdivision, area 7ip (within the posterior bank of the intraparietal sulcus), has few limbic connections but projects to and receives projections from widespread visual areas different than those that are connected with area 7a: the ventral bank and fundus of the STS including part of the STP cortex and the inferotemporal cortex (IT), areas MT (middle temporal) and possibly MTp (MT peripheral) and FST (fundal superior temporal) and portions of V2, V3v, V3d, V3A, V4, PO, and the inferior temporal (IT) convexity cortex. The connections between posterior parietal areas and visual areas located on the medial surface of the occipital and parieto\u2010occipital cortex, containing peripheral representations of the visual field (V2, V3, PO), represent a major previously unrecognized source of visual inputs to the parietal association cortex. Area 7b (the rostral part of the posterior parietal lobe) was distinctive among parietal areas in its selective association with somatosensory\u2010related areas: S1, S2, 5, the vestibular cortex, the insular cortex, and the supplementary somatosensory area (SSA). Like 7ip, area 7b had few limbic associations. Area 7m (on the medial posterior parietal cortex) has its own topographically distinct connections with the limbic (the posterior ventral bank of the cingulate sulcus, granular retrosplenial cortex, and presubiculum), visual (V2, PO, and the visual motion cortex in the upper bank of the STS), and somatosensory (SSA, and area 5) cortical areas."

                "text": "The distribution of interhemispheric connections was studied in extrastriate visual cortex of the macaque monkey. Callosal fiber terminations were identified by staining for anterograde degeneration following transection of the splenium of the corpus callosum. Retrogradely labeled cell bodies of callosal projection neurons were identified histochemically following application of horseradish peroxidase to the cut surface of the callosum. Results were displayed on unfolded, two-dimensional representations of the cortex, which permitted spatial and topological relationships between callosal recipient and callosal free cortical regions to be discerned readily. The overall pattern of callosal inputs to visual cortex can be subdivided into nine callosal recipient zones which surround seven callosal free regions in the occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes. This pattern provides reliable and useful landmarks for identifying the borders of at least five topographically organized extrastriate visual areas. There is a pronounced dorsoventral asymmetry in callosal projections, not recognized in previous studies, which reflects an asymmetry in the organization of visual areas in dorsal versus ventral halves of the occipital lobe. The pattern of callosal fiber terminations is mirrored by a very similar distribution of callosal projection neurons. There are significant regional differences in the laminar distribution of callosal projection cells, and these differences may reflect functionally distinct cortical subdivisions. A considerable degree of individual variability was found in the relationship of callosal connections to gyral and sulcal landmarks as well as in the fine structure of individual callosal recipient strips, suggesting that each animal has a unique \u201ccallosal fingerprint.\u201d These findings emphasize the usefulness of the callosal pathway in elucidating the functional organization of extrastriate visual cortex."

The polymodal region in the upper bank (area TPO) is divisible into four rostral\u2010to\u2010caudal architectonic sectors, exhibiting increasing degrees of laminar differentiation and cellularity as one proceeds caudally. These sectors, including the sulcal proisocortex (area Pro), are tied together in a sequence of reciprocal connections. Each rostrocaudal sector of area TPO also has reciprocal connections with the laterally adjacent area TAa, at the upper rim of the sulcus, and medially adjacent areas PGa and IPa, near the depth. A similar architectonic/ connectional organization exists for unimodal vision\u2010related cortex in the lower bank of the STS. Here a rostrocaudal sequence of reciprocal connections unites area Pro, rostral and caudal divisions of area TEa, and the extrastriate visual area OAa (MT). Area TEa also has reciprocal connections with adjacent segments of area TEm laterally, at the lower rim of the sulcus, and area IPa, medially, in the depth. In both upper and lower banks, caudal\u2010to\u2010rostral \u201cfor\u2010wardgoing\u201d connections begin in supragranular layers of cortex and terminate in and around layer IV. Reciprocal, \u201cbackgoing\u201d connections take origin from cells in infragranular layers and terminate mainly over the first layer of the caudally adjacent target zone. Orthogonally directed, \u201cside\u2010to\u2010side\u201d projections originate in both supra\u2010 and infragranular layers and terminate diffusely over all layers of cortex."

Afferent input and physiological properties of area 5 neurons in the medial bank of the intraparietal sulcus (i.e., area PEa) were also determined. Area LIP is composed of two myeloarchitectonic zones: a ventral zone (LIPv), which is densely myelinated, and a lightly myelinated dorsal zone (LIPd) adjacent to visual area 7a. Previous single\u2010unit recording studies in our laboratory have characterized visuomotor properties of area LIP neurons, including many neurons with powerful saccade\u2010related activity. In the first part of the present study, single\u2010unit recordings were used to map visual receptive fields from neurons in the two myeloarchitectonic zones of LIP. Receptive field size and eccentricity were compared to those in adjacent area 7a. The second part of the study investigated the cortico\u2010cortical connections of area LIP neurons using tritiated amino acid injections and fluorescent retrograde tracers placed directly into different rostrocaudal and dorsoventral parts of area LIP. The approach to area LIP was through somatosensory area 5, which eliminated the possibility of diffusion of tracers into area 7a."

Recordings were made from neurons located within the central-field representation of the V4 area of extrastriate visual cortex using a semichronic, nitrous-oxide preparation; the properties of 174 cells were examined in sufficient detail to permit their classification. Cyto- and myeloarchitectural studies confirmed the identification of the area. 2. Color-selective cells with either color-biased or color-opponent properties represented about 20% of the examined population. Their incidence was not significantly different from that of similar cells encountered in penetrations into the central-field representation of area V2. 3. Most color-selective cells had color-biased properties, responding best to wave-lengths shorter than 460 nm, or longer than 580 n, or both. No examples of \"green-biased\" cells were found. Some color-biased cells responded to photopically matched white light, while others did not. Very few cells showed overt color-opponent responses. The spectral sensitivity of color-selective cells was not unusually narrow. 4. Cells lacking color selectivity and responding equally well to chromatic and achromatic lights of equal photopic luminosity, were the most commonly encountered cell type in penetrations of different parts of the V4 area (56%). Other than color, these cells showed stimulus preferences like those of color-selective cells. 5. One-fourth of V4 cells could not be systematically driven with the various stimuli used. This finding is consistent with recent results of recordings from the prelunate gyrus of the behaving monkey suggesting that some V4 cells receive extraretinal signals. 6. Our results do not support recent claims that V4 is specialized in the detailed analysis of color information."

We recorded from single neurons in the dorsal bank and fundus of the anterior portion of the superior temporal sulcus, an area we term the superior temporal polysensory area (STP). Five macaques were studied under anesthesia ( N20) and immobilization in repeated recording sessions. 2. Almost all of the neurons were visually responsive, and over half responded to more than one sensory modality; 21% responded to visual and auditory stimuli, 17% responded to visual and somesthetic stimuli, 17% were trimodal, and 41% were exclusively visual. 3. Almost all the visual receptive fields extended into both visual half-fields, and the majority approached the size of the visual field of the monkey, including both monocular crescents. Somesthetic receptive fields were also bilateral and usually included most of the body surface. 4. Virtually all neurons responded better to moving visual stimuli than to stationary visual stimuli, and almost half were sensitive to the direction of movement. Several classes of directional neurons were found, including a) neurons selective for a single direction of movement throughout their receptive field, b) neurons selective for directions of movement radially symmetric about the center of gaze, and c) neurons selective for movement in depth. 5. The majority of neurons (70%) had little or no preference for stimulus size, shape, orientation, or contrast. The minority (30%) responded best to particular stimuli. Some of these appeared to be selective for faces. 6. The properties of most STP neurons, such as large receptive fields, sensitivity to movement, insensitivity to form, and polymodal responsiveness, suggest that STP is more involved in orientation and spatial functions than in pattern recognition."

We found that, in addition to connections with each other, both MST and FST have widespread connections with visual and polysensory areas in posterior prestriate, parietal, temporal, and frontal cortex. In prestriate cortex, both areas have connections with area V3A. MST alone has connections with the far peripheral field representations of V1 and V2, the parieto\u2010occipital (PO) visual area, and the dorsal prelunate area (DP), whereas FST alone has connections with area V4 and the dorsal portion of area V3. Within the caudal superior temporal sulcus, both areas have extensive connections with the middle temporal area (MT), MST alone has connections with area PP, and FST alone has connections with area V4t. In the rostral superior temporal sulcus, both areas have extensive connections with the superior temporal polysensory area (STP) in the upper bank of the sulcus and with area IPa in the sulcal floor. FST also has connections with the cortex in the lower bank of the sulcus, involving area TEa. In the parietal cortex, both the central field representation of MST and FST have connections with the ventral intraparietal (VIP) and lateral intraparietal (LIP) areas, whereas MST alone has connections with the inferior parietal gyrus. In the temporal cortex, the central field representation of MST as well as FST has connections with visual area TEO and cytoarchitectonic area TF. In the frontal cortex, both MST and FST have connections with the frontal eye field."

There were a number of main findings. (1) Representations of the face and head in areas 3b, 1, and S\u2010II are found on the upper bank of the lateral sulcus. Most of the mouth and lip representations of area 3b were found in a rostral extension along the lip of the lateral sulcus. Adjacent cortex deeper in the lateral sulcus represented the nose, eye, ear, and scalp. (2) S\u2010II was located on the upper bank of the lateral sulcus and extended past the fundus onto the deepest part of the lower bank. The face was represented most superficially in the sulcus, with the hand, foot, and trunk located in a rostrocaudal sequence deeper in the sulcus. The orientation of S\u2010II is \u201cerect,\u201d with the limbs pointing away from area 3b. (3) Neurons in S\u2010II were activated by light tactile stimulation of the contralateral body surface. Receptive fields were several times larger than for area 3b neurons. (4) A 1\u20102\u2010mm strip of cortex separating the face and hand representations in S\u2010II was consistently responsive to the stimulation of deep receptors but was unresponsive to light cutaneous stimulation. (5) Injections of horseradish peroxidase in the electrophysiologically identified hand or foot representations of area 3b revealed somatotopically matched interconnections with mapped hand and foot representations in S\u2010II. (6) A systematic representation of the body, termed the \u201cventral somatic\u201d area, VS, was found extending laterally from S\u2010II on the lower bank of the lateral sulcus. Within VS, the hand and foot were represented deep in the sulcus along the hand and foot regions of S\u2010II, and the face was lateral near the ventral lip of the sulcus. (7) Neurons at most recording sites in the VS region were activated by contralateral cutaneous stimuli. However, a few sites had neurons with bilateral receptive fields. Receptive field sizes were comparable to those in S\u2010II. In addition, neurons in islands of cortex in the VS region had properties that suggested that they were activated by pacinian receptors, while other regions were difficult to activate by light tactile stimuli but responded to stimuli that would activate deep receptors. (8) A few recording sites caudal to S\u2010II on the upper bank of the lateral sulcus were responsive to somatic stimuli. (9) Finally, some recording sites rostral to S\u2010II in the vicinity of the granular insular region were responsive to cutaneous stimuli. This cortex had sparse interconnections with area 3b. Overall the results provide a detailed understanding of how the face and head are represented in the lateral part of area 3b, reveal body surface representations in S\u2010II and an adjoining ventral somatic field (VS), locate neurons with pacinianlike features in or about VS, and demonstrate somatotopic interconnections between S\u2010II and area 3b (S\u2010I proper)."

The cells projecting from V2 to V4 are arranged in bands and the number of bands per cycle of cytochrome oxidase stripes varies (one cycle consists of a thin stripe, a thick stripe and two interstripes). In the Type 1 connectivity pattern, there is just one band per cycle, centred over the thin stripes but normally spreading into the neighbouring interstripes. In the Type 2 connectivity pattern there are two bands per cycle, generally rather narrower and centred over the interstripes. Thick stripes are mostly free of labelled cells. The return projection from V4 to V2, whilst being concentrated in the vicinity of the labelled cells, is more diffusely distributed and invades the territory of all the stripes."

The technique is based on information contained in outlines of histological sections, and it allows an entire hemisphere to be represented on a single cortical map. Maps for different hemispheres from individuals of the same species are similar in size, shape, and organization, and their configuration is largely independent of the plane of sectioning used for reconstruction. Many types of information pertaining to the location and organization of different functional subdivisions can be displayed on cortical maps; representative applications of the technique to mapping cerebral cortex in the macaque and the cat are shown. Areal measurements on cortical maps correspond closely (generally within 20%) to actual surface areas in the intact hemisphere. Therefore, the maps can also be used to provide accurate determinations of the absolute and relative extent of various anatomical and functional subdivisions of the cortex."

Our results indicate that dorsal V1 (representing the inferior contralateral visual quadrant) consistently projects in topographically organized fashion to V3 in the lunate and parietooccipital sulci as well as to the middle temporal area (MT) and dorsal V2. In contrast, ventral V1 (representing the superior contralateral quadrant) projects only to MT and ventral V2. A corresponding dorsoventral asymmetry in myeloarchitecture supports the idea that V3 is an area that is restricted to dorsal extrastriate cortex and lacks a complete representation of the visual field. The average surface area of myeloarchitectonically identified V3 was 89 mm2. Additional information was obtained concerning the laminar distribution of connections from V1 to V2 and V3, the patchiness of these projections, and the consistency of projections to other extrastriate areas, including V4 and V3A."

The properties of single cells in striate cortex of the rhesus monkey, representing the visual field 2 degrees -5 degrees from the fovea, were examined quantitatively with stationary and moving stimuli. Three distinct classes of cells were identified: S type, CX type, and T type. 2. S-type cells were defined as those oriented cells which to the optimal direction of movement in their receptive fields exhibited one or more spatially separate subfields within each of which a response was obtained to either a light or dark edge, but not to both. Several different types of S-cells were distinguished: a) S1-type cells for which moving edges revealed a single excitatory area within which a response was elicited by either a light or a dark edge but not by both. Most of these cells were unidirectional. b) S2-type cells for which moving edges revealed two spatially separate response areas, one of which was excited by a light edge and the other by a dark edge. Both regions responded to the same direction of movement. c) S3-type cells which had two response areas, one of which was excited by a stimulus moving in one direction (at right angles to the axis of orientation) and the other, of opposite contrast, which responded in the opposite direction, d) S4-type cells which to one direction of movement showed two spatially separate regions sensitive to a light and dark edge and which in the other direction of movement had only one responsive area (either light or dark). e) Cells which had multiple spatially separate subfields (S5-7 types). 3. CX-type cells were defined as those oriented cells which in their receptive fields exhibited no spatial separation for light- and dark-edge responses; they discharged to both edges in the same direction of movement and in the same spatial area. Flashing stimuli elicited both on and off responses throughout the receptive field. CX-type cells were predominantly of two types: those which were selective for direction of stimulus movement and those which were not. 4. A third class of cells (T-type) were those which were excited by only one sign of contrast change and responded in a sustained fashion even when there was no contour within the receptive field. These cells were poorly or not at all oriented; some of them were selective to wavelength. 5. Quantitative comparisons showed the following differences between S-type and CX-type cells: a) S-type cells had smaller receptive fields than CX-type cells but the populations over-lapped considerably. Receptive-field size was smallest in layer 4c. In all other layers S-type cells had the same size fields. CX-type cells, by contrast, tended to have larger fields in layer 5-6 than 2-3. b) The spatial separation between light and dark response areas was the best criterion for distinguishing S-type and CX-type cells. The distribution of this measure disclosed two populations of cells with relatively limited overlap. c) In layers 2 and 3, both S-type and CX-type cells had low spontaneous activity..."

                "text": "We have studied the mechanism of contour perception by recording from neurons in the visual cortex of alert rhesus monkeys. We used stimuli in which human observers perceive anomalous contours: A moving pair of notches in 2 bright rectangles mimicked an overlaying dark bar. For control, the notches were closed by thin lines so that the anomalous contours disappeared or half of the figure was blanked, with a similar effect. Orientation-selective neurons were studied. With the receptive fields centered in the gap, 23 of 72 (32%) neurons tested in area V2 responded to the moving \u201cbar\u201d even though the stimulus spared their response fields, and when the notches were closed, their responses were reduced or abolished. Likewise, when half of the figure was removed, the neurons usually failed to respond. Neurons with receptive fields within 4 degrees of the fovea signaled anomalous contours bridging gaps of 1 degree-3.5 degrees. The anomalous-contour responses were compared quantitatively with response field profiles and length-summation curves and found to exceed the predictions by linear-summation and summation- to-threshold models. Summation models also fail to explain the effect of closing lines which add only negligible amounts of light. In V1, only one of 26 neurons tested showed comparable responses, and only with a narrow gap. The others responded only when the stimulus invaded the response field and did not show the effect of closing lines, or failed to respond at all. The contour responses in V2, the nonadditivity, and the effect of closure can be explained by the previously proposed model (Peterhans et al., 1986), assuming that the corners excite end-stopped fields orthogonal to the contour whose signals are pooled in the contour neurons."

These cortical regions, which include portions of area 7b, the retroinsular (Ri) and postauditory fields (PA), and the granular insula (Ig) are largely buried within the lateral sulcus and most lie posterior to the caudal end of the insula. The differences in somatic activity in these various cortical fields in the unanesthetized cynomolgus monkey became apparent only after the properties of many neighboring neurons could be compared. Receptive fields for area 7b and Ig neurons were generally large (> 10cm2), with bilateral, moderately defined boundaries; some neurons in area 7b had receptive fields with labile borders as a function of wakefulness. In contrast, receptive fields for Ri neurons were generally < 10cm2 and contralateral, with stable, well\u2010defined boundaries."

The pathways selective for form and color seem to be derived mainly from the parvocellular geniculate subdivisions, the depth- and movement-selective components from the magnocellular. At lower levels, in the retina and in the geniculate, cells in these two subdivisions differ in their color selectivity, contrast sensitivity, temporal properties, and spatial resolution. These major differences in the properties of cells at lower levels in each of the subdivisions led to the prediction that different visual functions, such as color, depth, movement, and form perception, should exhibit corresponding differences. Human perceptual experiments are remarkably consistent with these predictions. Moreover, perceptual experiments can be designed to ask which subdivisions of the system are responsible for particular visual abilities, such as figure/ground discrimination or perception of depth from perspective or relative movement--functions that might be difficult to deduce from single-cell response properties."

                "text": "1. Pursuit eye movements are usually made against a visual background that is moved across the retina by the pursuit movement. We have investigated the effect of this visual stimulation on the response of pursuit cells that lie within the superior temporal sulcus (STS) of the monkey. 2. We assigned these pursuit cells to one of two groups depending on the nature of their preferred visual stimulus. One group of cells, comprising all cells located in the dorsal-medial region of the medial superior temporal area (MSTd) and some cells in lateral-anterior MST (MST1), responded to the motion of a large patterned field but showed little or no response to small spots or slits. The other group, consisting of all foveal middle temporal area (MTf) cells and many MST1 cells, responded preferentially to small spot motion or equally well to small spot motion or large field. 3. For many pursuit cells that preferred large-field stimuli, the visual response showed a reversal of the preferred direction of motion as the size of the stimulus field increased. The reversal usually occurred as the size of the moving random-dot field used as a stimulus increased in size from 20 x 20 degrees to 30 x 30 degrees for motion at approximately 10 degrees/s. The size of the filed stimulus leading to reversal of preferred direction depended on the speed of stimulus motion. Higher speeds of motion required larger stimulus fields to produce a reversal of preferred direction. This reversal (of preferred direction) did not reflect a center-surround organization of the receptive field but seemed to reflect the spatial summation properties of these cells. 4. For three-quarters of the cells that preferred large-field stimulation, the preferred direction of motion for the large field was opposite to the preferred direction of the pursuit response. The remaining cells showed either the same preferred directions for large-field visual stimulation and the pursuit response or had bidirectional visual responses. If we consider only the cells that show a reversal of preferred direction for large- and small-field stimuli, the preferred direction for the large field was always the opposite to that of pursuit, and the preferred direction for the small field was always the same. 5. During pursuit against a lighted background, the cells that showed opposite preferred directions for large-field stimulation and pursuit had synergistic responses--a facilitation of the pursuit response over the response during pursuit in the dark. Slow pursuit speeds (less than 20 degrees/s) produced the greatest facilitation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

                "text": "We have studied the mechanism of contour perception by recording from neurons in the visual cortex of alert rhesus monkeys. In order to assess the relationship between neural signals and perception, we compared the responses to edges and lines with the responses to patterns in which human observers perceive a contour where no line or edge is given (anomalous contour), such as the border between gratings of thin lines offset by half a cycle. With only one exception out of 60, orientation-selective neurons in area V1 did not signal the anomalous contour. Many neurons failed to respond to this stimulus at all, others responded according to the orientation of the grating lines. In area V2, 45 of 103 neurons (44%) signaled the orientation of the anomalous contour. Sixteen did so without signaling the orientation of the inducing lines. Some responded better to anomalous contours than to the optimum bars or edges. Preferred orientations and widths of tuning for anomalous contour and bar or edge were found to be highly correlated, but not identical, in each neuron. Similar to perception, the neuronal responses depended on a minimum number of lines inducing the contour, but not so much on line spacing, and tended to be weaker when the lines were oblique rather than orthogonal to the border. With oblique lines, the orientations signaled were biased towards the orientation orthogonal to the lines, as in the Zollner illusion. We conclude that contours may be defined first at the level of V2. While the unresponsiveness of neurons in V1 to this type of anomalous contour is in agreement with linear filter predictions, the responses of V2 neurons need to be explained. We assume that they sum the signals of 2 parallel paths, one that defines edges and lines and another that defines anomalous contours by pooling signals from end-stopped receptive fields oriented mainly orthogonal to the contour."

HRP\u2010WGA and tritiated amino acids were injected into subdivisions 7m, 7a, 7b, and 7ip of the posterior parietal cortex, and anterograde and retrograde label was recorded within the frontal motor and association cortices. Our main finding is that each subdivision of parietal cortex is connected with a unique set of frontal areas. Thus, area 7m, on the medial parietal surface, is interconnected with the dorsal premotor cortex and the supplementary motor area, including the supplementary eye field. Within the prefrontal cortex, area 7m's connections are with the rostral sector of the frontal eye field (FEF), the dorsal bank of the principal sulcus, and the anterior bank of the inferior arcuate sulcus (Walker's area 45). In contrast, area 7a, on the posterior parietal convexity, is not linked with premotor regions but is heavily interconnected with the rostral FEF in the anterior bank of the superior arcuate sulcus, the dorsolateral prefrontal convexity, the rostral orbitofrontal cortex, area 45, and the fundus and adjacent cortex of the dorsal and ventral banks of the principal sulcus. Area 7b, in the anterior part of the posterior parietal lobule, is interconnected with still a different set of frontal areas, which include the ventral premotor cortex and supplementary motor area, area 45, and the external part of the ventral bank of the principal sulcus. The prominent connections of area 7ip, in the posterior bank of the intraparietal sulcus, are with the supplementary eye field and restricted portions of the ventral premotor cortex, with a wide area of the FEF that includes both its rostral and caudal sectors, and with area 45. All frontoparietal connections are reciprocal, and although they are most prominent within a hemisphere, notable interhemispheric connections are also present."

In the present study, we conducted the first systematic survey of the responses of IT neurons to both simple stimuli, such as edges and bars, and highly complex stimuli, such as models of flowers, snakes, hands, and faces. If a neuron responded to any of these stimuli, we attempted to isolate the critical stimulus features underlying the response. We found that many of the responsive neurons responded well to virtually every stimulus tested. The remaining, stimulus-selective cells were often selective along the dimensions of shape, color, or texture of a stimulus, and this selectivity was maintained throughout a large receptive field. Although most IT neurons do not appear to be \u201cdetectors\u201d for complex objects, we did find a separate population of cells that responded selectively to faces. The responses of these cells were dependent on the configuration of specific face features, and their selectivity was maintained over changes in stimulus size and position. A particularly high incidence of such cells was found deep in the superior temporal sulcus. These results indicate that there may be specialized mechanisms for the analysis of faces in IT cortex."

In all three prefrontal regions, neurons with ipsilateral projections were labeled following injections of tracers into the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and neurons with callosal projections were sequentially or simultaneously labeled with injections into the contralateral principal sulcus (PS). Quantitative analysis indicates that associational and callosal neurons in prefrontal cortex are distinct cell populations with strikingly similar organization including (1) common topography;(2) common laminar positions in layers III, IV, and V; (3) two\u2010 to three\u2010fold higher densities in supragranular than infragranular layers; (4) common morphologies including a high proportion of nonpyramidal soma in the deeper cortical layers; (5) common uneven tangential distribution reminiscent of the interdigitation of their terminal fields; and (6) common subpopulations differing on the basis of terminal arbors. These findings indicate that the posterior parietal cortex and the prefrontal cortex form part of an integrated neural system important for spatiotemporal behaviors."

We examined the sensory properties of cells in the anterior bank of the caudal part of the superior temporal sulcus (caudal STS) in anesthetized, paralyzed monkeys to visual, auditory, and somesthetic stimuli. 2. In the anterior bank of the caudal STS, there were three regions distinguishable from each other and also from the middle temporal area (MT) in the floor of the STS and area Tpt in the superior temporal gyrus. The three regions were located approximately in the respective inner, middle, and outer thirds of the anterior bank of the caudal STS. These three regions are referred to, from the inner to the outer, as the medial superior temporal region (MST), the mostly unresponsive region, and the caudal STS polysensory region (cSTP), respectively. 3. The extent of MST and its response properties agreed with previous studies. Cells in MST responded exclusively to visual stimuli, had large visual receptive fields (RFs), and nearly all (91%) showed directional selectivity. 4. In the mostly unresponsive region, three quarters of cells were unresponsive to any stimulus used in this study. A quarter of the cells responded to only visual stimuli and most did not show directional selectivity for moving stimuli. Several directionally selective cells responded to movements of three-dimensional objects, but not of projected stimuli. 5. The response properties of cells in the superficial cortex of the caudal superior temporal gyrus, a part of area Tpt, external to cSTP were different from those of cells in the three regions in the anterior bank of the STS. Cells in Tpt were exclusively auditory, and had much larger auditory RFs (mean = 271 degrees) than those of acoustically-driven cSTP cells (mean = 138 degrees). 6. The cSTP contained unimodal visual, auditory, and somesthetic cells as well as multimodal cells of two or all three modalities. The sensory properties of cSTP cells were as follows. 1) Out of 200 cells recorded, 102 (51%) cells were unimodal (59 visual, 33 auditory, and 10 somesthetic), 36 (18%) cells were bimodal (21 visual+auditory, 7 visual+somesthetic, and 8 auditory+somesthetic), and four (2%) cells were trimodal. Visual and auditory responses were more frequent than somesthetic responses: the ratio of the population of cells driven by visual: auditory: somesthetic stimuli was 3:2:1. 2) Visual RFs were large (mean diameter, 59 degrees), but two-thirds were limited to the contralateral visual hemifield. About half the cells showed directional selectivity for moving visual stimuli. None showed selectivity for particular visual shapes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

We have recorded from these 3 subdivisions in macaques and squirrel monkeys, and find that each has distinctive physiological properties: (1) Cells in one set of dark stripes, in squirrel monkeys the thin stripes, are not orientation- selective; a high proportion show color-opponency. (2) Cells in the other set of dark stripes (thick stripes) are orientation-selective; most of them are also selective for binocular disparity, suggesting that they are concerned with stereoscopic depth. (3) Cells in the pale stripes are also orientation-selective and more than half of them are end-stopped. Each of the 3 subdivisions receives a different input from area 17: the thin stripes from the blobs, the pale stripes from the interblobs, the thick stripes from layer 4B. The pale stripes are thus part of the parvocellular system, and the thick stripes part of the magnocellular system. The physiological properties of the cells in the thin and pale stripes reflect the properties of their antecedent cells in 17, but nevertheless exhibit differences that suggest the kinds of processing that might occur at this stage."

                "text": "The monoclonal antibody Cat-301 was used to examine neurons in the cerebral cortex and dorsal thalamus of several mammalian species, including Old World monkeys, cats, bush babies, guinea pigs, and rats. In each species, subpopulations of cortical and thalamic neurons are stained along the surfaces of their somata and proximal dendrites. Cat- 301-positive cortical neurons include specific groups of pyramidal cells (e.g., corticospinal but not corticobulbar or callosal neurons in the monkey sensory-motor areas) and certain GABA-immunoreactive nonpyramidal cells. In the thalamus, the relay neurons projecting to the cortex and not the intrinsic neurons are stained. The Cat-301- positive neurons are nonhomogeneously distributed in the cat and monkey cortex and thalamus. In the cortex, they are densely packed in 2 bands that in most areas include layers III and V, but that in primary sensory areas include layers IV and VI. Because the density of stained neurons, their distribution, and the intensity of their staining vary among cortical areas, the borders between neighboring areas can often be detected by the differences in Cat-301 staining. Broader, regional differences are also readily apparent, for areas in the parietal and occipital lobes contain large numbers of intensely stained cells, but most areas in the frontal and temporal lobes contain fewer, more lightly stained neurons. The same broad differences are seen within the thalamus: only those nuclei reciprocally connected with intensely stained cortical areas contain large numbers of Cat-301-positive neurons. Differences among species include variations in cell density and distribution when a given cortical area or thalamic nucleus is compared between cats and monkeys. Greater differences are seen among the other species. Immunoreactive neurons in the cerebral cortex are sparse and lightly stained in guinea pigs, are restricted to the hippocampal formation in rats, and are very rare and isolated in bush babies. Similarly, Cat-301-positive thalamic neurons are restricted to only one or 2 nuclei in the guinea pig and rat and are extremely rare in the bush baby. Cat-301 stains organized groups of neurons in the cat and monkey cortex and thalamus. In addition to the laminar organization of stained cells in all cortical areas (see above), the Cat-301- positive neurons of monkey areas 17 and 18 are grouped into radial arrays. In area 17, clusters of stained cells are present in layers above and below layer IVC. These clusters lie at the centers of ocular dominance columns, within patches stained for cytochrome oxidase (CO). Most of these cells are also GABA-immunoreactive."

Thresholds were tested monocularly before and after ibotenic acid was used to lesion parvocellular layers 4 and 6 of the contralateral geniculate. The injections were centered at the representation of 6 degrees in the temporal field on the horizontal meridian, and vision was tested with localized stimuli at this location. In addition, in one of the monkeys, a lesion was made in magnocellular layer 1 of the opposite geniculate, and the same thresholds were tested. Physiological and anatomical reconstructions demonstrated complete destruction of the target layers in 1 parvocellular lesions and in the magnocellular lesion, and sparing of the nontarget layers in the tested region. Parvocellular lesions caused a 3\u20134-fold reduction in visual acuity within the affected part of the visual field, while the magnocellular lesion did not affect acuity. Both luminance and chromatic contrast sensitivity, tested with stationary gratings of 2 c/degree, were severely reduced by parvocellular lesions, but not affected by the magnocellular lesion. However, when luminance contrast sensitivity was tested with 1 c/degree gratings, counterphase modulated at 10 Hz, it was reduced by both parvocellular and magnocellular lesions. This study demonstrates that the parvocellular pathway dominates chromatic vision, acuity, and contrast detection at low temporal and high spatial frequencies, while the magnocellular pathway may mediate contrast detection at higher temporal and lower spatial frequencies."

                "text": "The sources of ipsilateral cortical afferent projections to basoventral and mediodorsal prefrontal cortices that receive some visual input were studied with retrograde tracers (horseradish peroxidase or fluorescent dyes) in eight rhesus monkeys. The basoventral regions injected with tracers included basal (orbital) areas 11 and 12, lateral area 12, and ventral area 46. The mediodorsal regions included portions of medial area 32 and the caudal part of dorsal area 8. These sites represent areas within basoventral and mediodorsal prefrontal cortices that show a gradual increase in architectonic differentiation in a direction from the least differentiated orbital and medial limbic cortices toward the most differentiated cortices in the arcuate concavity. The results showed that the visual input to basoventral and mediodorsal prefrontal cortices originated largely in topographically distinct visual areas. Thus, basoventral sites received most of their visual cortical projections from the inferior temporal cortex. The rostral inferior temporal region was the predominant source of visual projections to orbital prefrontal sites, whereas lateral area 12 and ventral area 46 also received projections which were found more caudally. In contrast, mediodorsal prefrontal sites received most of their visual projections from dorsolateral and dorsomedial visual areas. The cells of origin were located in rostromedial visual cortices after injection of retrograde tracers in area 32 and in more caudal medial and dorsolateral visual areas after injection in caudal area 8. The latter also received substantial projections from visuomotor regions in the caudal portion of the lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus. These results suggest that the basoventral prefrontal cortices are connected with ventral visual areas implicated in pattern recognition and discrimination, whereas the mediodorsal cortices are connected with medial and dorsolateral occipital and parietal areas associated with visuospatial functions. In addition, the prefrontal areas studied received projections from auditory and/or somatosensory cortices, from areas associated with more than one modality, and from limbic regions. Orbital area 12 seemed to be a major target of projections from somatosensory cortices and the rostral portion of medial area 32 received substantial projections from auditory cortices. The least architectonically differentiated areas (orbital area 11 and medial area 32) had more widespread corticocortical connections, including strong links with limbic cortices. In contrast, areas which showed the highest degree of architectonic differentiation within the basoventral (area 46) and the mediodorsal (area 8) prefrontal cortices had restricted corticocortical connections."

Twelve Macaca fascicularis were studied in repeated recording sessions while immobilized and anesthetized. V3 is a narrow strip (4\u20135 mm wide) of myeloarchitectonically distinct cortex located immediately anterior to V2. It contains a systematic representation of the central 35\u201340 degrees of the contralateral visual field; the representation of the upper quadrant is located ventrally in the hemisphere and that of the lower quadrant, dorsally. There is a small gap between the dorsal (V3d) and ventral (V3v) portions of V3. The representation of the horizontal meridian is adjacent to that in V2 and forms the posterior border of both V3d and V3v. Most or all of the anterior border of V3d consists of the representation of the lower vertical meridian. The entire anterior border of V3v consists of the representation of the upper vertical meridian. V4 is a strip of myeloarchitectonically distinct cortex 5\u20138 mm wide, immediately anterior to V3. It contains a coarse, but systematic, representation of approximately the central 35\u201340 degrees of the contralateral visual field. The representation of the upper visual field is located ventrally in the hemisphere. Most of the representation of the lower visual field is located dorsally. The posterior border of V4 corresponds to the representation of the vertical meridian, and the representation of the horizontal meridian is located at or near its anterior border. In both V3 and V4, the representation of the central visual field is magnified relative to that of the periphery.

                "text": "Electrical microstimulation and unit recording were performed in dorsomedial frontal cortex of four alert monkeys to identify an oculomotor area whose existence had been postulated rostral to the supplementary motor area. Contraversive saccades were evoked from 129 sites by stimulation. Threshold currents were lower than 20 microA in half the tests. Response latencies were usually longer than 50 ms (minimum: 30 ms). Eye movements were occasionally accompanied by blinks, ear, or neck movements. The cortical area yielding these movements was at the superior edge of the frontal lobe just rostral to the region from which limb movements could be elicited. Depending on the site of stimulation, saccades varied between two extremes: from having rather uniform direction and size, to converging toward a goal defined in space. The transition between these extremes was gradual with no evidence that these two types were fundamentally different. From surface to depth of cortex, direction and amplitude of evoked saccades were similar or changed progressively. No clear systematization was found depending on location along rostrocaudal or mediolateral axes of the cortex. The dorsomedial oculomotor area mapped was approximately 7 mm long and 6 mm wide. Combined eye and head movements were elicited from one of ten sites stimulated when the head was unrestrained. In the other nine cases, saccades were not accompanied by head rotation, even when higher currents or longer stimulus trains were applied. Presaccadic unit activity was recorded from 62 cells. Each of these cells had a preferred direction that corresponded to the direction of the movement evoked by local microstimulation. Presaccadic activity occurred with self-initiated as well as visually triggered saccades. It often led self-initiated saccades by more than 300 ms. Recordings made with the head free showed that the firing could not be interpreted as due to attempted head movements. Many dorsomedial cortical neurons responded to photic stimuli, either phasically or tonically. Sustained responses (activation or inhibition) were observed during target fixation. Twenty-one presaccadic units showed tonic changes of activity with fixation. Justification is given for considering the cortical area studied as a supplementary eye field. It shares many common properties with the arcuate frontal eye field. Differences noted in this study include: longer latency of response to electrical stimulation, possibility to evoke saccades converging apparently toward a goal, and long-lead unit activity with spontaneous saccades."

These were compared with the amygdaloid connections of a vision\u2010related polysensory area TG by making cortical injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and incubating the sections with tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) as the chromogen. Both areas TEa and TEp receive a major projection from the lateral basal nucleus and a minor one from the accessory basal nucleus of the amygdaloid complex, whereas these areas send a major projection to the lateral nucleus and a minor one to the lateral basal nucleus. Areas TEO, V4, V2, MST, MT, and V1 receive projections only from the lateral basal nucleus; none of them project to any amygdaloid nucleus. Thus, the amygdalofugal projections are more widespread and more complex than the amygdalopetal projections. These findings indicate that the connections between the amygdaloid nuclei and the visual areas are generally nonreciprocal and underlie the importance of a feedback mechanism from the amygdala to the visual cortical areas in visual information processing. There appears to be a caudorostral (occipitotemporal) gradient in the distribution and density of the amygdaloid projections, which become progressively more widespread and heavier among the progressively more rostral visual areas (from area V1 to area TEa)."

Of the 38 axons that we recovered, nine were recorded intracellularly before being filled with HRP. Light microscope and computer reconstructions of filled processes reveal highly stereotyped patterns of arborization and suggest that there are at least five discrete populations of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) afferent axon: (1) those to layer 4C beta, which have extremely circumscribed, dense terminal fields (small branches of which occasionally intrude into 4C alpha) but which have not been shown to project to other laminae; (2) afferents to layer 4A, which in some cases send fine ascending collaterals into layer 2\u20133 and which do not, apparently, send collaterals to other laminae; (3) afferents to layer 1, which are fine, extend over large distances horizontally, and send collaterals to layer 6A; (4) afferents to the lower two-thirds of layer 4C alpha, which have few or no collaterals in layer 6; and (5) afferents to the upper half of layer 4C alpha, which have arborizing collaterals in layer 6B. Of the nine axons that were recorded intracellularly, those with projections to layer 4C beta (two axons) and to layer 1 (one axon) had color-selective properties, whereas those (six axons) which arborized in 4C alpha all had transient, broad band and highly contrast-sensitive receptive fields. These properties are consistent with derivations from somata in the parvocellular and magnocellular divisions of the LGN, respectively. Afferents to 4C alpha were found to cover approximately 6 times as much surface area as afferents to 4C beta. The preterminal trunks of all axons were found to follow tortuous paths through the neuropil--paths that may derive from axon segregation during development. The wide ranging, patchy distributions of single afferents in 4C alpha suggest that individual 4C alpha axons supply more than one ocular dominance stripe. In one case where the terminal arborization of a 4C alpha axon was mapped against the transneuronally determined pattern of ocular dominance, three separate patches of terminal boutons were indeed found to coincide with the bands of one eye."

                "text": "1. We investigated cells in the middle temporal visual area (MT) and the medial superior temporal area (MST) that discharged during smooth pursuit of a dim target in an otherwise dark room. For each of these pursuit cells we determined whether the response during pursuit originated from visual stimulation of the retina by the pursuit target or from an extraretinal input related to the pursuit movement itself. We distinguished between these alternatives by removing the visual motion stimulus during pursuit either by blinking off the visual target briefly or by stabilizing the target on the retina. 2. In the foveal representation of MT (MTf), we found that pursuit cells usually decreased their rate of discharge during a blink or during stabilization of the visual target. The pursuit response of these cells depends on visual stimulation of the retina by the pursuit target. 3. In a dorsal-medial region of MST (MSTd), cells continued to respond during pursuit despite a blink or stabilization of the pursuit target. The pursuit response of these cells is dependent on an extraretinal input. 4. In a lateral-anterior region of MST (MST1), we found both types of pursuit cells; some, like those in MTf, were dependent on visual inputs whereas others, like those in MSTd, received an extraretinal input. 5. We observed a relationship between pursuit responses and passive visual responses. MST cells whose pursuit responses were attributable to extraretinal inputs tended to respond preferentially to large-field random-dot patterns. Some cells that preferred small spots also had an extraretinal input. 6. For 92% of the pursuit cells we studied, the pursuit response began after onset of the pursuit eye movement. A visual response preceding onset of the eye movement could be observed in many of these cells if the initial motion of the target occurred within the visual receptive field of the cell and in its preferred direction. In contrast to the pursuit response, however, this visual response was not dependent on execution of the pursuit movement. 7. For the remaining 8% of the pursuit cells, the pursuit discharge began before initiation of the pursuit eye movement. This occurred even though the initial motion of the target was outside the receptive field as mapped during fixation trials. Our data suggest, however, that such responses may be attributable to an expansion of the receptive field that accompanies enhanced visual responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

This strategy can be used for resolving computational problems arising in the domains of stereopsis, directed visual attention, and the perception of moving images. In each of these situations, some means of dynamically controlling how retinal outputs map onto higher-level targets is desirable--in order to achieve binocular fusion, to allow shifts of the focus of attention, and to prevent blurring of moving images. The proposed solution involves what we term \"shifter circuits,\" which allow for dynamic shifts in the relative alignment of input and output arrays without loss of local spatial relationships. The shifts are produced in increments along a succession of relay stages that are linked by diverging excitatory inputs. The direction of shift is controlled at each stage by inhibitory neurons that selectively suppress appropriate sets of ascending inputs. The shifter hypothesis is consistent with available anatomical and physiological evidence on the organization of the primate visual pathway, and it offers a sensible explanation for a variety of otherwise puzzling facts, such as the plethora of cells in the geniculorecipient layers of V1."

In some of the same owl and macaque monkeys, intracortical microstimulation was also used to evoke eye movements from dorsomedial frontal cortex (the supplementary motor area). In addition, in all of the owl and squirrel monkeys, intracortical microstimulation was also used to evoke body movements from the premotor and motor cortex situated between the central dimple and the FEF. These microstimulation data were directly compared to the distribution of anterogradely and retrogradely transported label resulting from injections of tracer into the FEF in each monkey. Since the injection sites were limited to the physiologically defined FEF, the demonstrated connections were solely those of the FEF. To aid in the interpretation of areal patterns of connections, the relatively smooth cortex of owl and squirrel monkeys was unfolded, flattened, and cut parallel to the flattened surface. Cortex of macaque monkeys, which has numerous deep sulci, was cut coronally."

Our observations indicate that the rostral superior parietal lobule (SPL) is connected with the ventroposterolateral (VPL) thalamic nucleus. In addition, whereas the rostral SPL is connected with the ventrolateral (VL) and lateral posterior (LP) thalamic nuclei, the rostral IPL has connections with the ventroposteroinferior (VPI), ventroposteromedial parvicellular (VPMpc), and suprageniculate (SG) nuclei as well as the VL nucleus. The caudal SPL and the midportion of IPL show projections mainly to the lateral posterior (LP) and oral pulvinar (PO) nuclei, respectively. These areas also have minor projections to the medial pulvinar (PM) nucleus. Finally, the medial SPL and the caudal IPL project heavily to the PM nucleus, dorsally and ventrally, respectively. In addition, the medial SPL has some connections with the LP nucleus, whereas the caudal IPL has projections to the lateral dorsal (LD) nucleus. Furthermore, the caudal and medial SPL and the caudal IPL regions have additional projections to the reticular and intralaminar nuclei\u2013the caudal SPL predominantly to the reticular, and the caudal IPL mainly to the intralaminar nuclei."

The borders were marked with electrolytic lesions, and horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin was injected within the field. Following tetramethyl benzidine histochemistry, afferent and efferent connections of the frontal eye field with subcortical structures were studied. Most connections were ipsilateral and were similar in all primates studied. These include reciprocal connections with the following nuclei: medial dorsal (lateral parts), ventral anterior (especially with pars magnocellularis), central lateral, paracentral, ventral lateral, parafascicular, medial pulvinar, limitans, and suprageniculate. The frontal eye field also projects to the ipsilateral pretectal nuclei, subthalamic nucleus, nucleus of the posterior commissure, superior colliculus (especially layer four), zona incerta, rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, nucleus Darkschewitsch, dorsomedial parvocellular red nucleus, interstitial nucleus of Cajal, basilar pontine nuclei, and bilaterally to the paramedian pontine reticular formation and the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis. Many of these structures also receive input from deeper layers of the superior colliculus and are known to participate in visuomotor function. These results (1) reveal connections that account for the parallel influence of the superior colliculus and the frontal eye field on visuomotor function; (2) suggest that there has been little evolutionary change in subcortical connections, and therefore function, of the frontal eye fields since the time that these lines of primates diverged; and (3) support the conclusion that the frontal eye fields are homologous in New and Old World monkeys."

The cytoarchitecture of the central olfactory areas was studies with cell and fiber stains, while the extent and pattern of the projections of the olfactory bulb were determined by the Fink\u2010Heimer and autoradiographic methods. The brain of one animal that had sustained damage to the olfactory bulb two days prior to sacrifice, and of one that had a transection of the olfactory tract ten days prior to sacrifice, were processed with the Fink\u2010Heimer technique. The first of these and four others received injections of 3H\u2010proline or 3H\u2010leucine into the olfactory bulb, and following a survival period of 18 hours, or 2, 4, 12, or 20 days, their brains were proceessed with the autoradiographic technique. The results were the same for both experimenal methods and for all survivalperiods."

Impulse activity was recorded from neurons in fovea1 striate (A17) and prestriate (Al@ cortex of monkeys trained to fixate monocularly and binocularly by rewarding them for detecting an abrupt change in the intensity of a small luminous spot. During periods of fixation, single bright or dark narrow bars moving across a frontoparallel plane were presented at a series of different depths. 2. Nearly all cortical neurons studied received input from both eyes. Binocular neurons were classifiedLint two categories on the basis of their monocular responses: those that gave similar responses to stimulation of right and left eye (ocular balance) and those that gave different responses (ocular unbalance). Different kinds of binocular interactions were observed. 3. Most neurons (84%) were sensitive to location of the stimulus in depth. Four types of depth-sensitive cells were recognized: a) tuned excitatory neurons, the most common type, that gave excitatory responses over a narrow range of depth about the fixation distance often with inhibitory flanks nearer and farther, and that typically received a balanced binocular input; b) tuned inhibitory neurons whose responses were largely suppressed by stimuli at or close to the plane of fixation; c) near neurons, which responded well to stimuli in front of the fixation plane and were suppressed by those behind it; d) far neurons, the opposite of near neurons. The last three types of depth cells were usually ocularly unbalanced. Peaks and steps of depthsensitivity profiles occurred at or close to the fixation distance (within t 0.4O of disparity), whereas the total range of binocular interaction, even for a single cell, could extend to more than t lo of disparity. 4. The results suggest that there are cells in fovea1 striate and prestriate which may be part of"

                "text": "We have studied the intrinsic organization of macaque striate cortex by tracing the pattern of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled axons and cell bodies produced by microinjections of HRP into single cortical laminae. Both anterograde and retrograde transport results were used to examine: (1) the pattern of projections from lamina 4C to the superficial layers; (2) the projection from lamina 4C to deeper cortical layers; and (3) the projections to lamina 4C from other cortical laminae. Laminae 4C alpha and 4C beta differ in their pattern of projections to the superficial layers of striate cortex. Axons from neurons in lamina 4C beta ascend through lamina 4B without giving off collaterals and terminate in lamina 4A and in the base of lamina 3. By contrast, axons from neurons in lamina 4C alpha terminate in lamina 4B and less densely in the 4A/3B region. The projection from lamina 4C beta to lamina 4A is particularly dense and is distributed in a patchy fashion immediately above each injection site. The projection from lamina 4C beta to lamina 3B appears less dense and more widespread; we estimate that individual 4C beta axons may spread laterally for more than 400 micron. Furthermore, the pattern of HRP-labeled cell bodies in lamina 4C beta following injections into laminae 4A and 3B provides evidence for a subdivision within 4C beta. These injections always produce a large number of labeled neurons in the upper part of lamina 4C beta, whereas the lower portion contains few labeled neurons that are located immediately under the center of the injection site. Both lamina 4C alpha and lamina 4C beta also contribute less dense projections to the deeper layers of cortex. Lamina 4C beta projects mainly to lamina 6, whereas lamina 4C alpha contributes axon terminals to both lamina 5A and lamina 6. Neurons in lamina 6 provide the bulk of the intracortical projections to lamina 4C. The axons of these neurons are fine in caliber and have a delicate side-spine morphology that is quite distinct from lateral geniculate axon arbors. Neurons in lamina 5A also project onto lamina 4C, but the projections of these neurons appear concentrated in lamina 4C alpha. These results confirm or refine many conclusions about intrinsic connections of striate cortex drawn from Golgi material and suggest new patterns of connections not suspected from previous work."

Quantitative observations were made of 55 cells, and qualitative observations were made on 228 others. The claustral cells formed a physiologically homogeneous population. The overwhelming majority were orientation selective, and most also showed a striking preference for long stimuli, their responses summating up to lengths of 40 degrees or more. Moving stimuli were always much more effective than stationary ones. In other respects, claustral cells were tolerant of wide variation in stimulus features. Their responses were about equally brisk to either direction of movement of a properly oriented stimulus, and the velocity of movement was likewise not critical. They appeared not to summate across the dimension of their receptive fields orthogonal to the preferred orientation so that narrow or broad slits, or edges, evoked similar responses. Dark slits on light backgrounds were as effective as light slits on dark backgrounds. Finally, a large majority of cells were driven equally well by either eye. These properties of claustral cells differ in several respects from those of their principal targets, cells in layer IV of visual cortex."

Terminal labeling originating from both frontal and parietal injection sites was found to be in apposition in 15 ipsilateral cortical areas: the supplementary motor cortex, the dorsal premotor cortex, the ventral premotor cortex, the anterior arcuate cortex (including the frontal eye fields), the orbitofrontal cortex, the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices, the frontoparietal operculum, the insular cortex, the medial parietal cortex, the superior temporal cortex, the parahippocampal gyrus, the presubiculum, the caudomedial lobule, and the medial prestriate cortex. Convergent terminal labeling was observed in the contralateral hemisphere as well, most prominently in the principal sulcal cortex, the superior arcuate cortex, and the superior temporal cortex. In certain common target areas, as for example the cingulate cortices, frontal and parietal efferents terminate in an array of interdigitating columns, an arrangement much like that observed for callosal and associational projections to the principal sulcus (Goldman-Rakic and Schwartz, 1982). In other areas, frontal and parietal terminals exhibit a laminar complementarity: in the depths of the superior temporal sulcus, prefrontal terminals are densely distributed within laminae I, III, and V, whereas parietal terminals occupy mainly laminae IV and VI directly below the prefrontal bands. Subcortical structures also receive apposing or overlapping projections from both prefrontal and parietal cortices. The dorsolateral prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices project to adjacent, longitudinal domains of the neostriatum, as has been described previously (Selemon and Goldman-Rakic, 1985); these projections are also found in close apposition in the claustrum, the amygdala, the caudomedial lobule, and throughout the anterior medial, medial dorsal, lateral dorsal, and medial pulvinar nuclei of the thalamus. In the brain stem, both areas of association cortex project to the intermediate layers of the superior colliculus and to the midline reticular formation of the pons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

                "text": "The efferent connections from area 6 and adjacent regions of area 9 were investigated in 9 adult monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) using the autoradiographic technique. Injection fields throughout these regions projected ipsilaterally to area 7 in the parietal lobe, n. caudatus, claustrum, n. ventralis anterior, n. parafascicularis, n. medialis dorsalis, n. reticularis thalami, colliculus superior, griseum centralis, griseum pontis and n. reticularis tegmenti pontis. The dorsolateral and medial aspects of areas 6 and 9 projected to the caudal cingulate gyrus, n. ventralis lateralis pars caudalis and n. interstitialis of Cajal. Axons originating in the ventrolateral cortex of areas 6 and 9 terminated in the orbital cortex. Projections arising from area 6 were traced to area 4, into the ventral bank of the rostral cingulate sulcus, to putamen, n. centralis superior lateralis, area X and its caudal continuation within n. ventralis posterior lateralis pars oralis, to n. ruber pars parvocellularis as well as the bulbar reticular formation. Adjacent prefrontal areas projected to the medial aspect of area 24, to areas 19, 20, 21 and 49/27 and to parts of the lateral thalamic nuclear group. This prefrontal projection pattern was in many respects also seen in cases injected into the dorsolateral portion of area 6, while its medial and ventrolateral subdivisions showed additional projections to n. ventralis medialis, the medial parts of centrum medianum as well as spinal and prorhinal projections, respectively.Furthermore, extensive bilateral connections were found within the frontal lobe, to basal ganglia, n. parafascicularis, n. centralis thalami, n. ruber, griseum pontis, n. reticularis tegmenti pontis, bulbar reticular formation and, more selectively, to colliculus superior and n. medialis dorsalis. Evidence was also presented for direct prefrontal connections to amygdala and corticonigral projections arising from areas 6 and 9. The results are discussed with respect to the intermediate position of area 6 between primary motor and prefrontal cortex as well as to differences of projection patterns within area 6 itself and, in particular, the supplementary motor area."

                "text": "We studied single neurons in the frontal eye fields of awake macaque monkeys and compared their activity with the saccadic eye movements elicited by microstimulation at the sites of these neurons. Saccades could be elicited from electrical stimulation in the cortical gray matter of the frontal eye fields with currents as small as 10 microA. Low thresholds for eliciting saccades were found at the sites of cells with presaccadic activity. Presaccadic neurons classified as visuomovement or movement were most associated with low (less than 50 microA) thresholds. High thresholds (greater than 100 microA) or no elicited saccades were associated with other classes of frontal eye field neurons, including neurons responding only after saccades and presaccadic neurons, classified as purely visual. Throughout the frontal eye fields, the optimal saccade for eliciting presaccadic neural activity at a given recording site predicted both the direction and amplitude of the saccades that were evoked by microstimulation at that site. In contrast, the movement fields of postsaccadic cells were usually different from the saccades evoked by stimulation at the sites of such cells. We defined the low-threshold frontal eye fields as cortex yielding saccades with stimulation currents less than or equal to 50 microA. It lies along the posterior portion of the arcuate sulcus and is largely contained in the anterior bank of that sulcus. It is smaller than Brodmann's area 8 but corresponds with the union of Walker's cytoarchitectonic areas 8A and 45. Saccade amplitude was topographically organized across the frontal eye fields. Amplitudes of elicited saccades ranged from less than 1 degree to greater than 30 degrees. Smaller saccades were evoked from the ventrolateral portion, and larger saccades were evoked from the dorsomedial portion. Within the arcuate sulcus, evoked saccades were usually larger near the lip and smaller near the fundus. Saccade direction had no global organization across the frontal eye fields; however, saccade direction changed in systematic progressions with small advances of the microelectrode, and all contralateral saccadic directions were often represented in a single electrode penetration down the bank of the arcuate sulcus. Furthermore, the direction of change in these progressions periodically reversed, allowing particular saccade directions to be multiply represented in nearby regions of cortex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Damage to these areas produces a deficit in the maintenance of pursuit eye movements when the target towards the side of the brain with the lesion. In the present experiments, we electrically stimulated these areas to better localize and understand the mechanisms underlying this directional pursuit deficit. 2. Monkeys were trained to pursue a moving target using a step-ramp task in which the target first stepped to an eccentric position and then moved smoothly across the screen. Trains of stimulation were applied after the monkey had begun to pursue the target to study stimulation effects of maintenance of pursuit. 3. Stimulation during pursuit frequently produced eye acceleration toward the side of the brain stimulated. Eye speed increased during pursuit toward the side stimulated and decreased during pursuit away from the side stimulated. This increase in velocity toward the side of the brain where stimulation presumably activated cells is consistent with the decrease in pursuit velocity toward the side of the brain after cells were removed by chemical lesions. 4. The increase or decrease in pursuit speed following stimulation produced a slip of the target on the retina. The pursuit system seemed to be insensitive to this slip during the period of stimulation, however, since the effect of stimulation during pursuit of a stabilized image (open-loop condition) was similar to that resulting from stimulation under normal pursuit conditions (closed-loop). This insensitivity to visual motion during stimulation suggests that the stimulation substitutes for that visual input. 5. The separation of eye and target position that resulted from stimulation did produce catch-up saccades. This provides added evidence that alteration of middle temporal area (MT) and medial superior temporal area (MST) modifies visual-motion but not visual-position information. 6. Stimulation that produced eye acceleration during pursuit produced only a slight effect during fixation of a stationary target. The effectiveness of the stimulation also increased as the speed of the pursuit increased between 5 and 25 degrees/s. These observations, which show that pursuit velocity altered the effect of stimulation, suggest that the stimulation acted on visual motion processing before information about the pursuit movement itself is incorporated. Since this stimulation produces directional pursuit effects, we hypothesize that the directional bias for pursuit originates in the visual signal conveyed to the pursuit system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

The moving of cells studied were not selective for bar width or for the spatial frequency of square-wave gratings. 3. Most cells responded selectively to the spatial frequency of the sine-wave gratings. 4. The spatial frequency of the sine-wave grating eliciting the optimal response could not be predicted from the organization of the receptive field of each cell as determined by stationary or moving stimuli. 5. The sharpness of spatial-frequency selectivity is only slightly more pronounced in S-type cells than in CX-type cells. 6. S-type and CX-type cells differ significantly in the temporal modulation of their discharges to gratings. S-type cells discharge in sharp bursts to each cycle which traverses the receptive field. CX-type cells discharge in a rather continuous fashion. This measure can be used reliably to classify cells as S or CS type."

We report here that this difference in luminance contrast gain between M and P cells is maintained at low levels of mean retinal illumination. In fact, our results suggest that in the mesopic and scotopic ranges of mean illumination, the M-cell/magnocellular pathway is the predominant conveyor of information about spatial contrast to the visual cortex."

                        "text": "In ventral occipital cortex, we have identified area VOT (the ventral occipitotemporal area) as a narrow cortical strip sandwiched between the ventral half of V4 and the inferotemporal cortex (Felleman et al., 1985; Van Essen et al., 199D- VOT lies just posterior to a callosal-recipient strip that delineates the border of inferotemporal cortex (Van Essen et al., 1982). V4t and VOT contain representations of the lower and upper parts of the visual field, respectively; we provisionally consider them to be separate areas with incomplete visual representations, much as has been argued for areas V3 and VP (Burkhalter et al., 1986). In the parietal lobe, the visual cortex occupies most or all of Brodmann's area 7 (PG and PE of von Bonin and Bailey, 1947). This region includes 3 areas (PO, PIP, and DP) situated posteriorly, 5 areas (7a, LIP, VIP, MIP, and MDP) situated more anteriorly and arranged in a lateral-to-medial swath that adjoins the somatosensory cortex, and 2 areas (MSTd and MST1) within the dorsal part of the superior temporal sulcus (STS). MST was originally identified as the region receiving direct inputs from MT and lying near the fundus of the STS (Maunsell and Van Essen, 1983). As initially defined, however, MST is not a homogeneous region. There is now evidence for splitting it into 3 distinct areas: a dorsal region (MSTd), a \"lateral\" region (MST1) that is situated ventro-antero-lateral to MSTd, and a region situated even further ventro-antero-laterally in the floor of the superior temporal sulcus (FST), which lies within the temporal lobe but which we consider here because of its affinity with the MST complex. This partitioning is based on findings of (1) different receptive field properties in all 3 regions (Desimone and Ungerleider, 1986; Hikosaka et al., 1988; Komatsu and Wurtz, 1988a,b; Newsome et al., 1988), (2) different connections of all 3 areas (Ungerleider and Desimone, 1986b; Andersen et al., 1990; Boussaoud et al., 1990), and (3) differential effects on pursuit eye movements from selective stimulation of MSTd versus MST1 (Komatsu and Wurtz, 1989). Area PIP (posterior intraparietal) lies in a region once considered to be part of V3A (Van Essen and Zeki, 1978), but the 2 areas can now be distinguished by their topographic organization and by their connections with other visual areas (Felleman etal., 1987; Colby et al., 1988). Area PO (parieto-occipital) is a topographically organized area situated medial and dorsal to PIP (Colby et al., 1988). Areas MIP (medial intraparietal) and MDP (medial dorsal parietal) have been identified on the basis of their connections with area PO (Colby et al., 1988). Area DP, which occupies the dorsal aspect of the prelunate gyrus, is a major source of visual inputs to area 7a (Andersen et al., 1990). DP has been distinguished from adjoining areas (V4, V3A, and 7a) primarily on the basis of differential connections, but also on the basis of visual topography and receptive field size and responsiveness (Maguire and Baizer, 1984; May and Andersen, 1986; Andersen et al., 1990). Area 7a, as described by Andersen et al. (1985), occupies the posterior part of the inferior parietal lobule and extends only a short distance into the intraparietal sulcus. Area VIP (ventral intraparietal) occupies the fundus of the intraparietal sulcus (Maunsell and Van Essen, 1983). LIP (lateral intraparietal) lies in the lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus, in between VIP and area 7a (Andersen et al., 1985). However, there is considerable uncertainty about the border between these areas. On the basis of projection patterns from MT, Maunsell and Van Essen (1983) suggested that VIP was restricted to the fundus of the intraparietal sulcus. Ungerleider and Desimone (1986b) found that MT projections sometimes extend substantially farther up the lateral bank of the sulcus into a heavily myelinated zone that they termed VIP*. This region lies within area LIP as described by Andersen et al. (1985) and may correspond to area LIPv of Blatt et al. (1990) and to the posterior portion of area POa-i of Seltzer and Pandya (1980). Overall, it remains unclear whether this heavily myelinated strip should be considered part of VIP or LIP or as a distinct area unto itself."

V4t and VOT contain representations of the lower and upper parts of the visual field, respectively; we provisionally consider them to be separate areas with incomplete visual representations, much as has been argued for areas V3 and VP (Burkhalter et al., 1986). In the parietal lobe, the visual cortex occupies most or all of Brodmann's area 7 (PG and PE of von Bonin and Bailey, 1947). This region includes 3 areas (PO, PIP, and DP) situated posteriorly, 5 areas (7a, LIP, VIP, MIP, and MDP) situated more anteriorly and arranged in a lateral-to-medial swath that adjoins the somatosensory cortex, and 2 areas (MSTd and MST1) within the dorsal part of the superior temporal sulcus (STS). MST was originally identified as the region receiving direct inputs from MT and lying near the fundus of the STS (Maunsell and Van Essen, 1983). As initially defined, however, MST is not a homogeneous region. There is now evidence for splitting it into 3 distinct areas: a dorsal region (MSTd), a \"lateral\" region (MST1) that is situated ventro-antero-lateral to MSTd, and a region situated even further ventro-antero-laterally in the floor of the superior temporal sulcus (FST), which lies within the temporal lobe but which we consider here because of its affinity with the MST complex. This partitioning is based on findings of (1) different receptive field properties in all 3 regions (Desimone and Ungerleider, 1986; Hikosaka et al., 1988; Komatsu and Wurtz, 1988a,b; Newsome et al., 1988), (2) different connections of all 3 areas (Ungerleider and Desimone, 1986b; Andersen et al., 1990; Boussaoud et al., 1990), and (3) differential effects on pursuit eye movements from selective stimulation of MSTd versus MST1 (Komatsu and Wurtz, 1989). Area PIP (posterior intraparietal) lies in a region once considered to be part of V3A (Van Essen and Zeki, 1978), but the 2 areas can now be distinguished by their topographic organization and by their connections with other visual areas (Felleman etal., 1987; Colby et al., 1988). Area PO (parieto-occipital) is a topographically organized area situated medial and dorsal to PIP (Colby et al., 1988). Areas MIP (medial intraparietal) and MDP (medial dorsal parietal) have been identified on the basis of their connections with area PO (Colby et al., 1988). Area DP, which occupies the dorsal aspect of the prelunate gyrus, is a major source of visual inputs to area 7a (Andersen et al., 1990). DP has been distinguished from adjoining areas (V4, V3A, and 7a) primarily on the basis of differential connections, but also on the basis of visual topography and receptive field size and responsiveness (Maguire and Baizer, 1984; May and Andersen, 1986; Andersen et al., 1990). Area 7a, as described by Andersen et al. (1985), occupies the posterior part of the inferior parietal lobule and extends only a short distance into the intraparietal sulcus. Area VIP (ventral intraparietal) occupies the fundus of the intraparietal sulcus (Maunsell and Van Essen, 1983). LIP (lateral intraparietal) lies in the lateral bank of the intraparietal sulcus, in between VIP and area 7a (Andersen et al., 1985). However, there is considerable uncertainty about the border between these areas. On the basis of projection patterns from MT, Maunsell and Van Essen (1983) suggested that VIP was restricted to the fundus of the intraparietal sulcus."
