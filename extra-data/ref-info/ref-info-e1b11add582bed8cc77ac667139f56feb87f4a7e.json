Existing approaches typically perform these two steps using a pipeline architecture: they use a Named-Entity Recognition (NER) system to find the boundaries of mentions in text, and an Entity Linking (EL) system to connect the mentions to entries in structured or semi-structured repositories like Wikipedia. However, the two tasks are tightly coupled, and each type of system can benefit significantly from the kind of information provided by the other. We present a joint model for NER and EL, called NEREL, that takes a large set of candidate mentions from typical NER systems and a large set of candidate entity links from EL systems, and ranks the candidate mention-entity pairs together to make joint predictions. In NER and EL experiments across three datasets, NEREL significantly outperforms or comes close to the performance of two state-of-the-art NER systems, and it outperforms 6 competing EL systems. On the benchmark MSNBC dataset, NEREL provides a 60% reduction in error over the next-best NER system and a 68% reduction in error over the next-best EL system."

Our approach relies on combined NER modules which transfer the disambiguation step to the EL component, where referential knowledge about entities can be used to select a correct entity reading. Hybridation is a main feature of our system, as we have performed experiments combining two types of NER, based respectively on symbolic and statistical techniques. Furthermore, the statistical EL module relies on entity knowledge acquired over a large news corpus using a simple rule-base disambiguation tool. An implementation of our system is described, along with experiments and evaluation results on French news wires. Linking accuracy reaches up to 87%, and the NER F-score up to 83%."

The proposed method relies on named entity recognition (NER), entity linking and document clustering models. Different from other tasks of named entities, both classification and clustering are considered in our models. After segmentation, information extraction and indexing in the preprocessing step, the test names in the documents would be judged to be common words or named entities based on hidden Markov model (HMM). And then each predicted entity should be linked to the category in the given knowledge base (KB) according to the character attributes and keywords. Finally, the named entities which have no reference in KB would be clustered into a new category based on singular value decomposition (SVD). An implementation of our presented models is described, along with experiments and evaluation results on the Second CIPS-SIGHAN Joint Conference on Chinese Language Processing Bakeoff (Bakeoff-2012). Named entity recognition F-measure reaches up to 76.67% and named entity disambiguation F-measure up to 69.47% within the test set of 32 names."

This easily results in inconsistent annotations, which are harmful to the performance of the aggregate system. We begin to address this problem with a joint model of parsing and named entity recognition, based on a discriminative feature-based constituency parser. Our model produces a consistent output, where the named entity spans do not conflict with the phrasal spans of the parse tree. The joint representation also allows the information from each type of annotation to improve performance on the other, and, in experiments with the OntoNotes corpus, we found improvements of up to 1.36% absolute F1 for parsing, and up to 9.0% F1 for named entity recognition."

This paper presents a robust method for collective disambiguation, by harnessing context from knowledge bases and using a new form of coherence graph. It unifies prior approaches into a comprehensive framework that combines three measures: the prior probability of an entity being mentioned, the similarity between the contexts of a mention and a candidate entity, as well as the coherence among candidate entities for all mentions together. The method builds a weighted graph of mentions and candidate entities, and computes a dense subgraph that approximates the best joint mention-entity mapping. Experiments show that the new method significantly outperforms prior methods in terms of accuracy, with robust behavior across a variety of inputs."

Due to the name variation problem and the name ambiguity problem, the entity linking decisions are critically depending on the heterogenous knowledge of entities. In this paper, we propose a generative probabilistic model, called entity-mention model, which can leverage heterogenous entity knowledge (including popularity knowledge, name knowledge and context knowledge) for the entity linking task. In our model, each name mention to be linked is modeled as a sample generated through a three-step generative story, and the entity knowledge is encoded in the distribution of entities in document P(e), the distribution of possible names of a specific entity P(s\\e), and the distribution of possible contexts of a specific entity P(c\\e). To find the referent entity of a name mention, our method combines the evidences from all the three distributions P(e), P(s\\e) and P(c\\e). Experimental results show that our method can significantly outperform the traditional methods."

Several systems have been proposed to link spots on Web pages to entities in Wikipedia. They are largely based on local compatibility between the text around the spot and textual metadata associated with the entity. Two recent systems exploit inter-label dependencies, but in limited ways. We propose a general collective disambiguation approach. Our premise is that coherent documents refer to entities from one or a few related topics or domains. We give formulations for the trade-off between local spot-to-entity compatibility and measures of global coherence between entities. Optimizing the overall entity assignment is NP-hard. We investigate practical solutions based on local hill-climbing, rounding integer linear programs, and pre-clustering entities followed by local optimization within clusters. In experiments involving over a hundred manually-annotated Web pages and tens of thousands of spots, our approaches significantly outperform recently-proposed algorithms."

                "text": "Entity Linking (EL) is the task of linking name mentions in Web text with their referent entities in a knowledge base. Traditional EL methods usually link name mentions in a document by assuming them to be independent. However, there is often additional interdependence between different EL decisions, i.e., the entities in the same document should be semantically related to each other. In these cases, Collective Entity Linking, in which the name mentions in the same document are linked jointly by exploiting the interdependence between them, can improve the entity linking accuracy. This paper proposes a graph-based collective EL method, which can model and exploit the global interdependence between different EL decisions. Specifically, we first propose a graph-based representation, called Referent Graph, which can model the global interdependence between different EL decisions. Then we propose a collective inference algorithm, which can jointly infer the referent entities of all name mentions by exploiting the interdependence captured in Referent Graph. The key benefit of our method comes from: 1) The global interdependence model of EL decisions; 2) The purely collective nature of the inference algorithm, in which evidence for related EL decisions can be reinforced into high-probability decisions. Experimental results show that our method can achieve significant performance improvement over the traditional EL methods."

On the other hand, unlabeled data (raw text) is often available \"for free\" in large quantities. Unlabeled data has shown promise in improving the performance of a number of tasks, e.g. word sense disambiguation, information extraction, and natural language parsing. In this thesis, we focus on two segmentation tasks, named-entity recognition and Chinese word segmentation. The goal of named-entity recognition is to detect and classify names of people, organizations, and locations in a sentence. The goal of Chinese word segmentation is to find the word boundaries in a sentence that has been written as a string of characters without spaces. Our approach is as follows: In a preprocessing step, we use raw text to cluster words and calculate mutual information statistics. The output of this step is then used as features in a supervised model, specifically a global linear model trained using the Perceptron algorithm. We also compare Markov and semi-Markov models on the two segmentation tasks. Our results show that features derived from unlabeled data substantially improves performance, both in terms of reducing the amount of labeled data needed to achieve a certain performance level and in terms of reducing the error using a fixed amount of labeled data. We find that sometimes semi-Markov models can also improve performance over Markov models. Thesis Supervisor: Michael Collins Title: Assistant Professor, CSAIL"

                "text": "Most high-level information extraction (IE) consists of compound and aggregated subtasks. Such IE problems are generally challenging and they have generated increasing interest recently. We investigate two representative IE tasks: (1) entity identification and relation extraction from Wikipedia, and (2) citation matching, and we formally define joint optimization of information extraction. We propose a joint paradigm integrating three factors -- segmentation, relation, and segmentation-relation joint factors, to solve all relevant subtasks simultaneously. This modeling offers a natural formalism for exploiting bidirectional rich dependencies and interactions between relevant subtasks to capture mutual benefits. Since exact parameter estimation is prohibitively intractable, we present a general, highly-coupled learning algorithm based on variational expectation maximization (VEM) to perform parameter estimation approximately in a top-down and bottom-up manner, such that information can flow bidirectionally and mutual benefits from different subtasks can be well exploited. In this algorithm, both segmentation and relation are optimized iteratively and collaboratively using hypotheses from each other. We conducted extensive experiments using two real-world datasets to demonstrate the promise of our approach."

The comprehensiveness of Wikipedia has made the online encyclopedia an increasingly popular target for disambiguation. Disambiguation to Wikipedia is similar to a traditional Word Sense Disambiguation task, but distinct in that the Wikipedia link structure provides additional information about which disambiguations are compatible. In this work we analyze approaches that utilize this information to arrive at coherent sets of disambiguations for a given document (which we call \"global\" approaches), and compare them to more traditional (local) approaches. We show that previous approaches for global disambiguation can be improved, but even then the local disambiguation provides a baseline which is very hard to beat."

                "text": "1.1 Introduction Relational data has two characteristics: first, statistical dependencies exist between the entities we wish to model, and second, each entity often has a rich set of features that can aid classification. For example, when classifying Web documents, the page's text provides much information about the class label, but hyperlinks define a relationship between pages that can improve classification [Taskar et al., 2002]. Graphical models are a natural formalism for exploiting the dependence structure among entities. Traditionally, graphical models have been used to represent the joint probability distribution p(y, x), where the variables y represent the attributes of the entities that we wish to predict, and the input variables x represent our observed knowledge about the entities. But modeling the joint distribution can lead to difficulties when using the rich local features that can occur in relational data, because it requires modeling the distribution p(x), which can include complex dependencies. Modeling these dependencies among inputs can lead to intractable models, but ignoring them can lead to reduced performance. A solution to this problem is to directly model the conditional distribution p(y|x), which is sufficient for classification. This is the approach taken by conditional random fields [Lafferty et al., 2001]. A conditional random field is simply a conditional distribution p(y|x) with an associated graphical structure. Because the model is"

Data sources include audio and image data in addition to pure text, and Arabic and Chinese in addition to English. The effort involves defining the research tasks in detail, collecting and annotating data needed for training, development, and evaluation, and supporting the research with evaluation tools and research workshops. This program began with a pilot study in 1999. The next evaluation is scheduled for September 2004. Introduction and Background Today\u2019s global web of electronic information, including most notably the www, provides a resource of unbounded information-bearing potential. But to fully exploit this potential requires the ability to extract content from human language automatically. That is the objective of the ACE program \u2013 to develop the capability to extract meaning from multimedia sources. These sources include text, audio and image data. The ACE program is a \u201ctechnocentric\u201d research effort, meaning that the emphasis is on developing core enabling technologies rather than solving the application needs that motivate the research. The program began in 1999 with a study intended to identify those key content extraction tasks to serve as the research targets for the remainder of the program. These tasks were identified in general as the extraction of the entities, relations and events being discussed in the language. In general objective, the ACE program is motivated by and addresses the same issues as the MUC program that preceded it (NIST 1999). The ACE program, however, attempts to take the task \u201coff the page\u201d in the sense that the research objectives are defined in terms of the target objects (i.e., the entities, the relations, and the events) rather than in terms of the words in the text. For example, the so-called \u201cnamed entity\u201d task, as defined in MUC, is to identify those words (on the page) that are names of entities. In ACE, on the other hand, the corresponding task is to identify the entity so named. This is a different task, one that is more abstract and that involves inference more explicitly in producing an answer. In a real sense, the task is to detect things that \u201caren\u2019t there\u201d. Reference resolution thus becomes an integral and critical part of solving the problem. During the period 2000-2001, the ACE effort was devoted solely to entity detection and tracking. During the period 2002-2003, relations were explored and added. 1 While the ACE program is directed toward extraction of information from audio and image sources in addition to pure text, the research effort is restricted to information extraction from text. The actual transduction of audio and image data into text is not part of the ACE research effort, although the processing of ASR and OCR output from such transducers is. Now, starting in 2004, events are being explored and added as the third of the three original tasks."

We show how to solve this dilemma with Gibbs sampling, a simple Monte Carlo method used to perform approximate inference in factored probabilistic models. By using simulated annealing in place of Viterbi decoding in sequence models such as HMMs, CMMs, and CRFs, it is possible to incorporate non-local structure while preserving tractable inference. We use this technique to augment an existing CRF-based information extraction system with long-distance dependency models, enforcing label consistency and extraction template consistency constraints. This technique results in an error reduction of up to 9% over state-of-the-art systems on two established information extraction tasks."

Often, however, we wish to label sequence data in multiple interacting ways\u2014for example, performing part-of-speech tagging and noun phrase segmentation simultaneously, increasing joint accuracy by sharing information between them. We present dynamic conditional random fields (DCRFs), which are CRFs in which each time slice has a set of state variables and edges\u2014a distributed state representation as in dynamic Bayesian networks\u2014and parameters are tied across slices. (They could also be called conditionallytrained Dynamic Markov Networks.)

Importantly, features for semi-CRFs can measure properties of segments, and transitions within a segment can be non-Markovian. In spite of this additional power, exact learning and inference algorithms for semi-CRFs are polynomial-time\u2014often only a small constant factor slower than conventional CRFs. In experiments on five named entity recognition problems, semi-CRFs generally outperform conventional CRFs."

Such a factorization can be visualized with a bipartite graph that we call a factor graph, In this tutorial paper, we present a generic message-passing algorithm, the sum-product algorithm, that operates in a factor graph. Following a single, simple computational rule, the sum-product algorithm computes-either exactly or approximately-various marginal functions derived from the global function. A wide variety of algorithms developed in artificial intelligence, signal processing, and digital communications can be derived as specific instances of the sum-product algorithm, including the forward/backward algorithm, the Viterbi algorithm, the iterative \"turbo\" decoding algorithm, Pearl's (1988) belief propagation algorithm for Bayesian networks, the Kalman filter, and certain fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms."

We compare its performance with that of the method developed by Buckley and LeNir (1985), which combines cycles of BFGS steps and conjugate direction steps. Our numerical tests indicate that the L-BFGS method is faster than the method of Buckley and LeNir, and is better able to use additional storage to accelerate convergence. We show that the L-BFGS method can be greatly accelerated by means of a simple scaling. We then compare the L-BFGS method with the partitioned quasi-Newton method of Griewank and Toint (1982a). The results show that, for some problems, the partitioned quasi-Newton method is clearly superior to the L-BFGS method. However we find that for other problems the L-BFGS method is very competitive due to its low iteration cost. We also study the convergence properties of the L-BFGS method, and prove global convergence on uniformly convex problems."
