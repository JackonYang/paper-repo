Log-linear models can easily encode the long-range dependencies inherent in coordination and extraction phenomena, which CCG was designed to handle. Log-linear models have previously been applied to statistical parsing, under the assumption that all possible parses for a sentence can be enumerated. Enumerating all parses is infeasible for large grammars; however, dynamic programming over a packed chart can be used to efficiently estimate the model parameters. We describe a parellelised implementation which runs on a Beowulf cluster and allows the complete WSJ Penn Treebank to be used for estimation."

A semantic parser is learned given a set of sentences annotated with their correct meaning representations. The main innovation of WASP is its use of state-of-the-art statistical machine translation techniques. A word alignment model is used for lexical acquisition, and the parsing model itself can be seen as a syntax-based translation model. We show that WASP performs favorably in terms of both accuracy and coverage compared to existing learning methods requiring similar amount of supervision, and shows better robustness to variations in task complexity and word order."

The performance of semantic parsing can be potentially improved by using discriminative reranking, which explores arbitrary global features. In this paper, we investigate discriminative reranking upon a baseline semantic parser, SCISSOR, where the composition of meaning representations is guided by syntax. We examine if features used for syntactic parsing can be adapted for semantic parsing by creating similar semantic features based on the mapping between syntax and semantics. We report experimental results on two real applications, an interpreter for coaching instructions in robotic soccer and a natural-language database interface. The results show that reranking can improve the performance on the coaching interpreter, but not on the database interface."

The approach assumes a formal grammar for the target representation language and learns transformation rules that exploit the non-terminal symbols in this grammar. The learned transformation rules incrementally map a natural-language sentence or its syntactic parse tree into a parse-tree for the target formal language. Experimental results are presented for two corpora. one which maps English instructions into an existing formal coaching language for simulated RoboCup soccer agents, and another which maps English U.S.-geography questions into a database query language. We show that our method performs overall better and faster than previous approaches in both domains."

I present Multi-Modal Combinatory Categorial Grammar, a formulation of ccg which incorporates devices and category constructors from related categorial frameworks and demonstrate the effectiveness of these modifications both for providing parsimonious linguistic analyses and for improving the representation of the lexicon and computational processing. I begin by introducing the various grammar frameworks which set the background for this dissertation and then discuss aspects of providing substantive universals for the theory of ccg. Most importantly, I lay out some of the components necessary for providing a theory of the lexicon, outlining previous approaches and suggesting directions forward. I then turn to a description of the syntactic extraction asymmetries found in English, Tagalog, and Toba Batak and the word order flexibility of Tagalog and Turkish, and discuss previous approaches to handling the data. Having explicated the foundations and the linguistic motivations for the dissertation, I show how the multi-modal perspective on grammatical composition provided by the logical tradition of categorial grammar can be incorporated into ccg\u2019s rulebased approach. The enhanced resource-sensitivity of this perspective allows me to utilize an invariant rule component, controlling the applicability of the combinatory rules via lexical specification rather than with constraints on the rules themselves. This control is shown to be necessary for many aspects of English syntax, and I furthermore demonstrate that the multi-modal approach can improve upon existing ccg analyses for English and Dutch. The second major development is a redefinition of categories and combinatory rules which relaxes the strict ordering inherent in categories that is normally assumed in categorial grammars. The manner in which this is done permits an intuitive account of local scrambling behavior without increasing the generative power of the system. Bounded long-distance scrambling is handled with the same mechanisms as ccg \u2013 type-raising and crossed composition rules. I furthermore show how the resource-sensitivity of the system effectively limits the permutative possibilities for some constructions in the otherwise quite free grammar of Turkish. Having thus motivated and developed the multi-modal ccg system, I present"

Starting with a general framework for constructing a suitable logical form, CHILL is able to train on a corpus comprising sentences paired with database queries and induce parsers that map subsequent sentences directly into executable queries. Experimental results with a complete database-query application for U.S. geography show that CHILL is able to learn parsers that outperform a preexisting, hand-crafted counterpart. These results demonstrate the ability of a corpus-based system to produce more than purely syntactic representations. They also provide direct evidence of the utility of an empirical approach at the level of a complete natural language application."

The parses of this example and the set of parses of earlier examples in the corpus are used to build a lexicon and annotate the corpus. We report the results from experiments on two generated corpora and also on the more complicated LLL corpus, that contains examples from subsets of English syntax.

Coordination, relativization, and related prosodic phenomena have been analyzed in CCG in terms of a radically revised notion of surface structure. CCG surface structures do not exhibit traditional notions of syntactic dominance and command, and do not constitute an autonomous level of representation. Instead, they reflect the computations by which a sentence may be realized or analyzed, to synchronously define a predicate-argument structure, or logical form. Surface Structure and Interpretation shows that binding and control can be captured at this level, preserving the advantages of CCG as an account of coordination and unbounded dependency.The core of the book is a detailed treatment of extraction, a focus of syntactic research since the early work of Chomsky and Ross. The topics addressed include the sources of subject-object asymmetries and phenomena attributed to the Empty Category Principle (ECP), asymmetric islands, parasitic gaps, and the relation of coordination and extraction, including their interactions with binding theory. In his conclusion, the author relates CCG to other categorial and type-driven approaches and to proposals for minimalism in linguistic theory.Linguistic Inquiry Monograph No. 30"

Assuming an ordered representation of the predicate-argument structure, this work proposes a Combinatory Categorial Grammar formulation of relating surface case cues to categories and types for correctly placing the arguments in the predicate-argument structure. This is achieved by treating case markers as type shifters. Unlike other CG formulations, type shifting does not proliferate or cause spurious ambiguity. Categories of all argument-encoding grammatical functions follow from the same principle of category assignment. Normal order evaluation of the combinatory form reveals the predicate-argument structure. The application of the method to Turkish is shown."

In order to do that, a computational learning system is used, composed of a Universal Grammar with associated parameters, and a learning algorithm, following the Principles and Parameters Theory. The Universal Grammar is implemented as a Unification-Based Generalised Categorial Grammar, embedded in a default inheritance network of lexical types. The learning algorithm receives input from a corpus of spontaneous child-directed transcribed speech annotated with logical forms and sets the parameters based on this input. This framework is used as a basis to investigate several aspects of language acquisition. In this thesis I concentrate on the acquisition of subcategorisation frames and word order information, from data. The data to which the learner is exposed can be noisy and ambiguous, and I investigate how these factors affect the learning process. The results obtained show a robust learner converging towards the target grammar given the input data available. They also show how the amount of noise present in the input data affects the speed of convergence of the learner towards the target grammar. Future work is suggested for investigating the developmental stages of language acquisition as predicted by the learning model, with a thorough comparison with the developmental stages of a child. This is primarily a cognitive computational model of language learning that can be used to investigate and gain a better understanding of human language acquisition, and can potentially be relevant to the development of more adaptive NLP technology."

The lexicon learned consists of phrases paired with meaning representations. WOLFIE is part of an integrated system that learns to transform sentences into representations such as logical database queries. \n \nExperimental results are presented demonstrating WOLFIE's ability to learn useful lexicons for a database interface in four different natural languages. The usefulness of the lexicons learned by WOLFIE are compared to those acquired by a similar system, with results favorable to WOLFIE. A second set of experiments demonstrates WOLFIE's ability to scale to larger and more difficult, albeit artificially generated, corpora. \n \nIn natural language acquisition, it is difficult to gather the annotated data needed for supervised learning; however, unannotated data is fairly plentiful. Active learning methods attempt to select for annotation and training only the most informative examples, and therefore are potentially very useful in natural language applications. However, most results to date for active learning have only considered standard classification tasks. To reduce annotation effort while maintaining accuracy, we apply active learning to semantic lexicons. We show that active learning can significantly reduce the number of annotated examples required to achieve a given level of performance."

The need for NLI's has become more pronounced due to the widespread access to complex databases now available through the Internet. A challenging problem for empirical NLP is the automated acquisition of NLI's from training examples. We present a method for integrating statistical and relational learning techniques for this task which exploits the strength of both approaches. Experimental results from three different domains suggest that such an approach is more robust than a previous purely logic-based approach."

Robust parsing is applied only after a full analysis has failed, and it involves the two stages of (1) parsing a set of phrases and clauses, and (2) gluing them together to obtain a single semantic frame encoding the full meaning of the sentence. In a recent evaluation, less than two-thirds of the sentences analyzed yielded a full parse, but the overwhelming majority of the remaining sentences were analyzed correctly by the robust parsing scheme. When text input was replaced by recognizer outputs, even though the recognizer produced greater than 50% sentence error rate, the drop in score (%correct-%incorrect) was only 10 percentage points. This indicates that most of the recognizer errors are harmless in terms of meaning analysis, as long as a robust mechanism for accounting for the parsable phrases is in place.<<ETX>>"

The predominant approach in computational linguistics has been to use a parametric model with some variant of maximum-likelihood estimation. The assumptions under which maximum-likelihood estimation is justified are arguably quite strong. This chapter discusses the statistical theory underlying various parameter-estimation methods, and gives algorithms which depend on alternatives to (smoothed) maximum-likelihood estimation. We first give an overview of results from statistical learning theory. We then show how important concepts from the classification literature - specifically, generalization results based on margins on training data - can be derived for parsing models. Finally, we describe parameter estimation algorithms which are motivated by these generalization bounds."

The hierarchical method improves the system accuracy, reduces the computational complexity of the translation, provides additional numerical robustness during training and decoding, and permits a more efficient packaging of the components of the natural language understanding system."

Unlike discriminative reranking approaches, our system can take advantage of learned features in all stages of decoding. We first discuss several challenges to error-driven discriminative approaches. In particular, we explore different ways of updating parameters given a training example. We find that making frequent but smaller updates is preferable to making fewer but larger updates. Then, we discuss an array of features and show both how they quantitatively increase BLEU score and how they qualitatively interact on specific examples. One particular feature we investigate is a novel way to introduce learning into the initial phrase extraction process, which has previously been entirely heuristic."

The switching model uses subtrees mined from the corpus and a boosting-based algorithm to select the most appropriate output. The application of the proposed framework on the domain of semantic parsing shows advantages in comparison with the original large margin methods."

Conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."

To support this task, the Multi-Site ATIS Data COllection Working group (MADCOW) coordinates data collection activities. This paper describes recent MADCOW activities. In particular, this paper describes the migration of the ATIS task to a richer relational database and development corpus (ATIS-3) and describes the ATIS-3 corpus. The expanded database, which includes information on 46 US and Canadian cities and 23,457 flights, was released in the fall of 1992, and data collection for the ATIS-3 corpus began shortly thereafter. The ATIS-3 corpus now consists of a total of 8297 released training utterances and 3211 utterances reserved for testing, collected at BBN, CMU, MIT, NIST and SRI. 2906 of the training utterances have been annotated with the correct information from the database. This paper describes the ATIS-3 corpus in detail, including breakdowns of data by type (e.g. context-independent, context-dependent, and unevaluable)and variations in the data collected at different sites. This paper also includes a description of the ATIS-3 database. Finally, we discuss future data collection and evaluation plans."
