Instead of just adjusting the weights in a network of fixed topology. Cascade-Correlation begins with a minimal network, then automatically trains and adds new hidden units one by one, creating a multi-layer structure. Once a new hidden unit has been added to the network, its input-side weights are frozen. This unit then becomes a permanent feature-detector in the network, available for producing outputs or for creating other, more complex feature detectors. The Cascade-Correlation architecture has several advantages over existing algorithms: it learns very quickly, the network determines its own size and topology, it retains the structures it has built even if the training set changes, and it requires no back-propagation of error signals through the connections of the network."

How effectively this potential is realized depends on the power of the learning algorithm used. As an example of a task requiring recurrency, Servan-Schreiber, Cleeremans, and McClelland1 have applied a simple recurrent learning algorithm to the task of recognizing finite-state grammars of increasing difficulty. These nets showed considerable power and were able to learn fairly complex grammars by emulating the state machines that produced them. However, there was a limit to the difficulty of the grammars that could be learned. We have applied a more powerful recurrent learning procedure, called real-time recurrent learning2,6 (RTRL), to some of the same problems studied by Servan-Schreiber, Cleeremans, and McClelland. The RTRL algorithm solved more difficult forms of the task than the simple recurrent networks. The internal representations developed by RTRL networks revealed that they learn a rich set of internal states that represent more about the past than is required by the underlying grammar. The dynamics of the networks are determined by the state structure and are not chaotic."

The network uses the pattern of activation over a set of hidden units from time-step t1, together with element t, to predict element t 1. When the network is trained with strings from a particular finite-state grammar, it can learn to be a perfect finite-state recognizer for the grammar. When the network has a minimal number of hidden units, patterns on the hidden units come to correspond to the nodes of the grammar, although this correspondence is not necessary for the network to act as a perfect finite-state recognizer. We explore the conditions under which the network can carry information about distant sequential contingencies across intervening elements. Such information is maintained with relative ease if it is relevant at each intermediate step; it tends to be lost when intervening elements do not depend on it. At first glance this may suggest that such networks are not relevant to natural language, in which dependencies may span indefinite distances. However, embeddings in natural language are not completely independent of earlier information. The final simulation shows that long distance sequential contingencies can be encoded by the network even if only subtle statistical properties of embedded strings depend on the early information."

                "text": "Time is at the heart of many pattern recognition tasks (e.g., speech recognition). However, connectionist learning algorithms to date are not well-suited for dealing with time-varying input patterns. This chapter introduces a specialized connectionist architecture and corresponding specialization of the back-propagation learning algorithm that operates efficiently, both in computational time and space requirements, on temporal sequences. The key feature of the architecture is a layer of selfconnected hidden units that integrate their current value with the new input at each time step to construct a static representation of the temporal input sequence. This architecture avoids two deficiencies found in the back-propagation unfolding-intime procedure (Rumelhart, Hinton, & Williams, 1986) for handing sequence recognition tasks: first, it reduces the difficulty of temporal credit assignment by focusing the back-propagated error signal; second, it eliminates the need for a buffer to hold the input sequence and/or intermediate activity levels. The latter property is due to the fact that during the forward (activation) phase, incremental activity traces can be locally computed that hold all information necessary for back propagation in time. It is argued that this architecture should scale better than conventional recurrent architectures with respect to sequence length. The architecture has been used to implement a temporal version of Rumelhart and McClelland's (1986) verb past-tense model. The hidden units learn to behave something like Rumelhart and McClelland's \"Wickelphones,\" a rich and flexible representation of temporal information."

One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction."

The performance of resulting larger phonetic nets was found to be as good as the performance of the subcomponent nets by themselves. This approach avoids the excessive learning times that would be necessary to train larger networks and allows for incremental learning. Large time-delay neural networks constructed incrementally by applying these modular training techniques achieved a recognition performance of 96.0% for all consonants and 94.7% for all phonemes.<<ETX>>"
