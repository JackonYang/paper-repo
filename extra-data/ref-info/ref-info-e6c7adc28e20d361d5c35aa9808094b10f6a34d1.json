A subsequence is any ordered sequence of k characters occurring in the text though not necessarily contiguously. The subsequences are weighted by an exponentially decaying factor of their full length in the text, hence emphasising those occurrences which are close to contiguous. A direct computation of this feature vector would involve a prohibitive amount of computation even for modest values of k, since the dimension of the feature space grows exponentially with k. The paper describes how despite this fact the inner product can be efficiently evaluated by a dynamic programming technique. A preliminary experimental comparison of the performance of the kernel compared with a standard word feature space kernel [6] is made showing encouraging results."

The method can be applied iteratively to build a kernel on a innnite set from kernels involving generators of the set. The family of kernels generated generalizes the family of radial basis kernels. It can also be used to deene kernels in the form of joint Gibbs probability distributions. Kernels can be built from hidden Markov random elds, generalized regular expressions, pair-HMMs, or ANOVA de-compositions. Uses of the method lead to open problems involving the theory of innnitely divisible positive deenite functions. Fundamentals of this theory and the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces are reviewed and applied in establishing the validity of the method."

Unfortunately, existing algorithms are both computationally intensive and difficult to implement. Previous algorithms are expensive due to two factors: the exponential number of rules that must be generated and the use of a Monte Carlo parsing algorithm. In this paper we solve the first problem by a novel reduction of the DOP model to a small, equivalent probabilistic context-free grammar. We solve the second problem by a novel deterministic parsing strategy that maximizes the expected number of correct constituents, rather than the probability of a correct parse tree. Using the optimizations, experiments yield a 97% crossing brackets rate and 88% zero crossing brackets rate. This differs significantly from the results reported by Bod, and is comparable to results from a duplication of Pereira and Schabes's (1992) experiment on the same data. We show that Bod's results are at least partially due to an extremely fortuitous choice of test data, and partially due to using cleaner data than other researchers."

This problem of combining preferences arises in several applications, such as that of combining the results of different search engines, or the \"collaborative-filtering\" problem of ranking movies for a user based on the movie rankings provided by other users. In this work, we begin by presenting a formal framework for this general problem. We then describe and analyze an efficient algorithm called RankBoost for combining preferences based on the boosting approach to machine learning. We give theoretical results describing the algorithm's behavior both on the training data, and on new test data not seen during training. We also describe an efficient implementation of the algorithm for a particular restricted but common case. We next discuss two experiments we carried out to assess the performance of RankBoost. In the first experiment, we used the algorithm to combine different web search strategies, each of which is a query expansion for a given domain. The second experiment is a collaborative-filtering task for making movie recommendations."

Like Vapnik's maximal-margin classifier, our algorithm takes advantage of data that are linearly separable with large margins. Compared to Vapnik's algorithm, however, ours is much simpler to implement, and much more efficient in terms of computation time. We also show that our algorithm can be efficiently used in very high dimensional spaces using kernel functions. We performed some experiments using our algorithm, and some variants of it, for classifying images of handwritten digits. The performance of our algorithm is close to, but not as good as, the performance of maximal-margin classifiers on the same problem, while saving significantly on computation time and programming effort."
