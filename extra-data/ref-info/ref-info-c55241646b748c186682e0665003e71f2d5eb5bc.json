Curvature discrimination as a function of mean curvature could be described by a power law with an exponent averaging 1.57. Data were also gathered as a function of line width, stimulus orientation, and retinal eccentricity. Finally, masking experiments provided evidence that the mechanisms responsible for curvature discrimination were both orientation and spatial-frequency selective. The data are well fitted by theoretical results derived from a line-element model that has recently been applied to spatial-frequency discrimination."

This representation based on curvature easily translates into a binary string that will describe the abstract shape of any smooth image curve. The computation of the basic shape primitives requires dealing with two ever-pervasive problems: contour noise and scale. We show how contour noise can be estimated given knowledge of the shape of the filter used to compute curvature from the edge list of the contour. To handle the scale problem, we use an adaptation of Witkin's scale space. Our algorithm differs from Witkin's by using a notion of parts to set criteria for significant structures."

A useful lightness scale should be the integral of this probability density function, for then equal intervals along the scale are equally probable and carry equal information.

The proof assumes that the filtered signal can be represented as a polynomial of finite, albeit possibly high, order. The result applies to zero and level crossings of linear differential operators of Gaussian filters. In this case the signal is determined uniquely, modulus the null space of the linear operator. The theorem can be extended to two-dimensional functions. These results are reminiscent of Logan\u2019s theorem [ Bell Syst. Tech. J.56, 487 ( 1977)]. They imply that extrema of derivatives at different scales are a complete representation of a signal. They are especially relevant for computational vision in the case of the Laplacian operator acting on image intensities, and they suggest rigorous foundations for the primal sketch."

                "text": "xThe ideas of information theory are at present stimulating many different areas of psychological inquiry. In providing techniques for quantifying situations which have hitherto been difficult or impossible to quantify, they suggest new and more precise ways of conceptualizing these situations (see Miller [12] for a general discussion and bibliography). Events ordered in time are particularly amenable to informational analysis; thus language sequences are being extensively studied, and other sequences, such as those of music, plainly invite research. In this paper I shall indicate some of the ways in which the concepts and techniques of information theory may clarify our understanding of visual perception. When we begin to consider perception as an information-handling process, it quickly becomes clear that much of the information received by any higher organism is redundant. Sensory events are highly interdependent in both space and time: if we know at a given moment the states of a limited number of receptors (i.e., whether they are firing or not firing), we can make better-than-chance inferences with respect to the prior and subsequent states of these receptors, and also with respect to the present, prior, and subsequent states of other receptors. The preceding statement, taken in its broadest im1 The experimental work for this study was performed as part of the United States Air Force Human Resources Research and Development Program.

In the present discussion, however, we shall restrict our attention to special types of lawfulness which may exist in space at a fixed time, and which seem particularly relevant to processes of visual perception."

Only one parameter, the quantum efficiency of the primary photo process, locates position on this scale. The characteristic equation for the performance of an ideal device has the form BC2\u03b12=constantwhere B is the luminance of the scene, and C and \u03b1 are respectively the threshold contrast and angular size of a test object in the scene. This ideal type of performance is shown to be satisfied by a simple experimental television pickup arrangement. By means of the arrangement, two parameters, storage time of the eye and threshold signal-to-noise ratio are determined to be 0.2 seconds and five respectively. Published data on the performance of the eye are compared with ideal performance. In the ranges of B(10\u22126 to 102 footlamberts), C(2 to 100 percent) and \u03b1(2\u2032 to 100\u2032), the performance of the eye may be matched by an ideal device having a quantum efficiency of 5 percent at low lights and 0.5 percent at high lights. This is of considerable technical importance in simplifying the analysis of problems involving comparisons of the performance of the eye and man-made devices. To the extent that independent measurements of the quantum efficiency of the eye confirm the values (0.5 percent to 5.0 percent), the performance of the eye is limited by fluctuations in the primary photo process. To the same extent, other mechanisms for describing the eye that do not take these fluctuations into account are ruled out. It is argued that the phenomenon of dark adaptation can be ascribed only in small part to the primary photo-process and must be mainly controlled by a variable gain mechanism located between the primary photo-process and the nerve fibers carrying pulses to the brain."

The field of the optical wave is modeled as the sum of a coherent (deterministic) component and a random component, the intensity of which is assumed governed by the generalized n distribution of Nakagami. We further assume that the statistics are inherently nonstationary by treating the average intensity of the random portion of the field as a fluctuating quantity. The resulting unconditional I\u2013K distribution for the intensity fluctuations is a generalized form of the K distribution that is applicable to all conditions of atmospheric turbulence for which data have been obtained, including weak turbulence for which the K distribution is not theoretically applicable."
