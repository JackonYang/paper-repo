With the rapid growth in research over thelast few years on recognizing text in natural scenes, thereis an urgent need to establish some common benchmarkdatasets, and gain a clear understanding of the current stateof the art. We use the term robust reading to refer to text imagesthat are beyond the capabilities of current commercialOCR packages. We chose to break down the robust readingproblem into three sub-problems, and run competitionsfor each stage, and also a competition for the best overallsystem. The sub-problems we chose were text locating,character recognition and word recognition.By breaking down the problem in this way, we hope togain a better understanding of the state of the art in eachof the sub-problems. Furthermore, our methodology involvesstoring detailed results of applying each algorithm toeach image in the data sets, allowing researchers to study indepth the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. Thetext locating contest was the only one to have any entries.We report the results of this contest, and show cases wherethe leading algorithms succeed and fail."

In particular, we focus on recognizing characters in situations that would traditionally not be handled well by OCR techniques. We present an annotated database of images containing English and Kannada characters. The database comprises of images of street scenes taken in Bangalore, India using a standard camera. The problem is addressed in an object cateogorization framework based on a bag-of-visual-words representation. We assess the performance of various features based on nearest neighbour and SVM classification. It is demonstrated that the performance of the proposed method, using as few as 15 training images, can be far superior to that of commercial OCR systems. Furthermore, the method can benefit from synthetically generated training data obviating the need for expensive data collection and annotation."

Convenient access to a collection requires an index, which is manually created at great labor and expense. Since current handwriting recognizers do not perform well on historical documents, a technique called word spotting has been developed: clusters with occurrences of the same word in a collection are established using image matching. By annotating \"interesting\" clusters, an index can be built automatically. We present an algorithm for matching handwritten words in noisy historical documents. The segmented word images are preprocessed to create sets of 1-dimensional features, which are then compared using dynamic time warping. We present experimental results on two different data sets from the George Washington collection. Our experiments show that this algorithm performs better and is faster than competing matching techniques."

The traditional approach, focusing on the correct classification of isolated characters, has been exhausted. The demonstration of the superiority of a new classification method under operational conditions requires large experimental facilities and databases beyond the resources of most researchers. In any case, even perfect classification of individual characters is insufficient for the conversion of complex archival documents to a useful computer-readable form. Many practical OCR tasks require integrated treatment of entire documents and well-organized typographic and domain-specific knowledge. New OCR systems should take advantage of the typographic uniformity of paragraphs or other layout components. They should also exploit the unavoidable interaction with human operators to improve themselves without explicit 'training'. >"

A CAPTCHA (\"Completely Automated Public Turing test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart\") is a program that can generate and grade tests that most humans can pass, yet current computer programs can't pass. EZ-Gimpy, currently used by Yahoo, and Gimpy are CAPTCHAs based on word recognition in the presence of clutter. These CAPTCHAs provide excellent test sets since the clutter they contain is adversarial; it is designed to confuse computer programs. We have developed efficient methods based on shape context matching that can identify the word in an EZ-Gimpy image with a success rate of 92%, and the requisite 3 words in a Gimpy image 33% of the time. The problem of identifying words in such severe clutter provides valuable insight into the more general problem of object recognition in scenes. The methods that we present are instances of a framework designed to tackle this general problem."

Relative to document recognition, it is challenging because of font variability, minimal language context, and uncontrolled conditions. Much information available to solve this problem is frequently ignored or used sequentially. Similarity between character images is often overlooked as useful information. Because of language priors, a recognizer may assign different labels to identical characters. Directly comparing characters to each other, rather than only a model, helps ensure that similar instances receive the same label. Lexicons improve recognition accuracy but are used post hoc. We introduce a probabilistic model for STR that integrates similarity, language properties, and lexical decision. Inference is accelerated with sparse belief propagation, a bottom-up method for shortening messages by reducing the dependency between weakly supported hypotheses. By fusing information sources in one model, we eliminate unrecoverable errors that result from sequential processing, improving accuracy. In experimental results recognizing text from images of signs in outdoor scenes, incorporating similarity reduces character recognition error by 19 percent, the lexicon reduces word recognition error by 35 percent, and sparse belief propagation reduces the lexicon words considered by 99.9 percent with a 12X speedup and no loss in accuracy."

The algorithm is intended for use by blind and visually impaired subjects walking through city scenes. We first obtain a dataset of city images taken by blind and normally sighted subjects. From this dataset, we manually label and extract the text regions. Next we perform statistical analysis of the text regions to determine which image features are reliable indicators of text and have low entropy (i.e. feature response is similar for all text images). We obtain weak classifiers by using joint probabilities for feature responses on and off text. These weak classifiers are used as input to an AdaBoost machine learning algorithm to train a strong classifier. In practice, we trained a cascade with 4 strong classifiers containing 79 features. An adaptive binarization and extension algorithm is applied to those regions selected by the cascade classifier. Commercial OCR software is used to read the text or reject it as a non-text region. The overall algorithm has a success rate of over 90% (evaluated by complete detection and reading of the text) on the test set and the unread text is typically small and distant from the viewer."

To achieve this goal, we present a technique, called Video OCR (Optical Character Reader), which detects, extracts, and reads text areas in digital video data. In this paper, we address problems, describe the method by which Video OCR operates, and suggest applications for its use in digital news archives. To solve two problems of character recognition for videos, low-resolution characters and extremely complex backgrounds, we apply an interpolation filter, multi-frame integration and character extraction filters. Character segmentation is performed by a recognition-based segmentation method, and intermediate character recognition results are used to improve the segmentation. We also include a method for locating text areas using text-like properties and the use of a language-based postprocessing technique to increase word recognition rates. The overall recognition results are satisfactory for use in news indexing. Performing Video OCR on news video and combining its results with other video understanding techniques will improve the overall understanding of the news video content."

The higher recognition rates for isolated characters vs. those obtained for words and connected character strings well illustrate this fact. A good part of recent progress in reading unconstrained printed and written text may be ascribed to more insightful handling of segmentation. This paper provides a review of these advances. The aim is to provide an appreciation for the range of techniques that have been developed, rather than to simply list sources. Segmentation methods are listed under four main headings. What may be termed the \"classical\" approach consists of methods that partition the input image into subimages, which are then classified. The operation of attempting to decompose the image into classifiable units is called \"dissection.\" The second class of methods avoids dissection, and segments the image either explicitly, by classification of prespecified windows, or implicitly by classification of subsets of spatial features collected from the image as a whole. The third strategy is a hybrid of the first two, employing dissection together with recombination rules to define potential segments, but using classification to select from the range of admissible segmentation possibilities offered by these subimages. Finally, holistic approaches that avoid segmentation by recognizing entire character strings as units are described."

The objective is to automatically annotate pictures in order to make consumer photo sets searchable based on the image content. The system is designed to process a large volume of photos, by quickly isolating candidate text regions, and successively cascading them through a series of text recognition engines which jointly make a decision on whether or not the region contains text that is readable by OCR. In addition, a dedicated rejection engine is built on top of each text recognizer to adapt its confidence measure to the specifics of the task. The resulting system achieves very high text retrieval rate and data throughput with very small false detection rates."

These parameters include such variables as position, pose, lighting, background, camera quality, and gender. While there are many applications for face recognition technology in which one can control the parameters of image acquisition, there are also many applications in which the practitioner has little or no control over such parameters. This database, Labeled Faces in the Wild, is provided as an aid in studying the latter, unconstrained, recognition problem. The database contains labeled face photographs spanning the range of conditions typically encountered in everyday life. The database exhibits \u201cnatural\u201d variability in factors such as pose, lighting, race, accessories, occlusions, and background. In addition to describing the details of the database, we provide specific experimental paradigms for which the database is suitable. This is done in an effort to make research performed with the database as consistent and comparable as possible. We provide baseline results, including results of a state of the art face recognition system combined with a face alignment system. To facilitate experimentation on the database, we provide several parallel databases, including an aligned version."

The paper starts with discussing the working conditions of content-based retrieval: patterns of use, types of pictures, the role of semantics, and the sensory gap. Subsequent sections discuss computational steps for image retrieval systems. Step one of the review is image processing for retrieval sorted by color, texture, and local geometry. Features for retrieval are discussed next, sorted by: accumulative and global features, salient points, object and shape features, signs, and structural combinations thereof. Similarity of pictures and objects in pictures is reviewed for each of the feature types, in close connection to the types and means of feedback the user of the systems is capable of giving by interaction. We briefly discuss aspects of system engineering: databases, system architecture, and evaluation. In the concluding section, we present our view on: the driving force of the field, the heritage from computer vision, the influence on computer vision, the role of similarity and of interaction, the need for databases, the problem of evaluation, and the role of the semantic gap."

Our work is motivated by the pictorial structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager. The basic idea is to represent an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems. We address the problem of using pictorial structure models to find instances of an object in an image as well as the problem of learning an object model from training examples, presenting efficient algorithms in both cases. We demonstrate the techniques by learning models that represent faces and human bodies and using the resulting models to locate the corresponding objects in novel images."

This algorithm sets up correspondence as an integer quadratic programming problem, where the cost function has terms based on similarity of corresponding geometric blur point descriptors as well as the geometric distortion between pairs of corresponding feature points. The algorithm handles outliers, and thus enables matching of exemplars to query images in the presence of occlusion and clutter. Given the correspondences, we estimate an aligning transform, typically a regularized thin plate spline, resulting in a dense correspondence between the two shapes. Object recognition is then handled in a nearest neighbor framework where the distance between exemplar and query is the matching cost between corresponding points. We show results on two datasets. One is the Caltech 101 dataset (Fei-Fei, Fergus and Perona), an extremely challenging dataset with large intraclass variation. Our approach yields a 48% correct classification rate, compared to Fei-Fei et al 's 16%. We also show results for localizing frontal and profile faces that are comparable to special purpose approaches tuned to faces."

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

We provide several novel constructions of captchas. Since captchas have many applications in practical security, our approach introduces a new class of hard problems that can be exploited for security purposes. Much like research in cryptography has had a positive impact on algorithms for factoring and discrete log, we hope that the use of hard AI problems for security purposes allows us to advance the field of Artificial Intelligence. We introduce two families of AI problems that can be used to construct captchas and we show that solutions to such problems can be used for steganographic communication. captchas based on these AI problem families, then, imply a win-win situation: either the problems remain unsolved and there is a way to differentiate humans from computers, or the problems are solved and there is a way to communicate covertly on some channels."

Thus it is descriptive of the shape of the object. Object recognition can be achieved by matching this feature with a priori knowledge of the shape context of the boundary points of the object. Experimental results are promising on handwritten digits, trademark images."

HIPs are increasingly used to protect services against automatic script attacks. To be effective, a HIP must be difficult enough to discourage script attacks by raising the computation and/or development cost of breaking the HIP to an unprofitable level. At the same time, the HIP must be easy enough to solve in order to not discourage humans from using the service. Early HIP designs have successfully met these criteria [1]. However, the growing sophistication of attackers and correspondingly increasing profit incentives have rendered most of the currently deployed HIPs vulnerable to attack [2,7,12]. Yet, most companies have been reluctant to increase the difficulty of their HIPs for fear of making them too complex or unappealing to humans. The purpose of this study is to find the visual distortions that are most effective at foiling computer attacks without hindering humans. The contribution of this research is that we discovered that 1) automatically generating HIPs by varying particular distortion parameters renders HIPs that are too easy for computer hackers to break, yet humans still have difficulty recognizing them, and 2) it is possible to build segmentation-based HIPs that are extremely difficult and expensive for computers to solve, while remaining relatively easy for humans."
