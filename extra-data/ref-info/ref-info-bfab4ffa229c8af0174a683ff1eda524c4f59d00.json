We consider the task of grammatical inference with recurrent neural networks. Specifically, we consider the task of classifying natural language sentences as grammatical or ungrammatical: can a recurrent neural network be made to exhibit the same kind of discriminatory power which is provided by the principles and parameters linguistic framework, or government and binding theory? We attempt to train a network, without the bifurcation into learned vs. innate components assumed by Chomsky, to produce the same judgments as native speakers on sharply grammatical/ungrammatical data. We consider how a recurrent neural network could possess linguistic capability, and investigate the properties of Elman, Narendra and Parthasarathy (N&P) and Williams and Zipser (W&Z) recurrent networks, and Frasconi-Gori-Soda (FGS) locally recurrent networks in this setting. We show that both Elman and W&Z recurrent neural networks are able to learn an appropriate grammar."

Two different theoretical derivations lead to distributions which are quite different from the probability distributions that are usually used for backing-off.

We wish to treat the outputs of the network as probabilities of alternatives (e.g. pattern classes), conditioned on the inputs. We look for appropriate output non-linearities and for appropriate criteria for adaptation of the parameters of the network (e.g. weights). We explain two modifications: probability scoring, which is an alternative to squared error minimisation, and a normalised exponential (softmax) multi-input generalisation of the logistic non-linearity. The two modifications together result in quite simple arithmetic, and hardware implementation is not difficult either. The use of radial units (squared distance instead of dot product) immediately before the softmax output stage produces a network which computes posterior distributions over class labels based on an assumption of Gaussian within-class distributions. However the training, which uses cross-class information, can result in better performance at class discrimination than the usual within-class training method, unless the within-class distribution assumptions are actually correct."
