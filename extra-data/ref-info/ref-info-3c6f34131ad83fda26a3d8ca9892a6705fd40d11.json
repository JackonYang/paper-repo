The models proposed store information in modifiable synapses. Their connexions need to be specified only in a general way, a large part being random. They resist destruction of a good many cells. When built with Hebb synapses (or any other class B or C synapses whose modification depends on the conjunction of activities in two cells) they demand a number of inputs to each cell that agrees well with known anatomy. The number of cells required, for performing tasks of the kind considered as well as the human brain can perform them, is only a small fraction of the number of cells in the brain. It is suggested that the models proposed are likely to be the most economical possible for their tasks, components and constructional constraints, and that any others that approach them in economy must share with them certain observable features, in particular an abundance of cells with many independent inputs and low thresholds."

                "text": "One of the earliest discoveries of our ancient forefathers of the forest or the cave must have been the deadly nature of a blow delivered on the nape of the neck; yet in this they did but follow the instinct shown by the tiger and the hawk in striking down-their prey. As Homer sang, here lies 'the fountain of the nerves.' This Heroghilus found to be in the ventricle of the cereilum or parencephalon,2 an organ recently described by Aristotle. g Herophilus, who was the first professor of anatomy at the school of Alexandria, taught that \"the purer blood from the heart ascends thiough the veins to the torcular, the wine-press; there it yields up the vital spirit and this, mixing with the air inspired through the ethmoid cells, is in the ventricle of the parencephalon converted mto animal spirit, the, breath of the rational soul. This diffuses through the ventricles and into the substance of the brain, and by the channels of the nerves it is carried to all parts of the body, as well to impart movement to the muscles as to carry to the seat of the rational soul the sensations received by the sense organs.\" Five hundred years later, Galen' seems to have been responsible for afew additional points. The passage of air and spirit to and from the cerebellar ventricle is guarded by the vermis, a sort of spiral valve under the control of the pineal body; the cerebellum is of a hard, firm consistency to impart strength to the motor nerves, while the cerebrum is softer for the reception of impressions conveyed to it by the sensory nerves. Until recent years the motor part of the facial nerve was still known as the pars dura, the sensory auditory as the pars mollis of the seventh nerve. Galen knew nothing of the dissociation of the mental faculties, nor of the separate seat in the various ventricles of perception, imagination, judgment, and memory; this theory was first advanced more than a century later by a noted alienist, Poseidon. Through him, the cerebellum, more particularly the cerebellar ventricle, became the organ of memory, a sort of chest for the safe storage of ideas and images. It was protected by the vermis against a too sudden access of spirit from the anterior ventricles, a function lateir assumed for the anterior medullary velum,"
