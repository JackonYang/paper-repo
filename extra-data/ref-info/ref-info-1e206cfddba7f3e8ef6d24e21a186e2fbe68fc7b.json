Profound changes in the pattern of responses in the null tests were produced by altering the spatial frequency. Illustrations of the main effects are presented in Fig. 5. Complete null tests are shown at two different spatial frequencies for one X cell and one Y cell. The alternating grating was modulated sinusoidally at 4 Hz and the interval between spatial phases was 300. The averaged responses for the peak positions are placed in the centre of each row and at the left and right end. The responses 900 away from these peaks are, as expected, null positions. The main point is that, for each Y cell, the pattern of response changed, becoming spatial phase-insensitive at spatial frequencies high for the cell. Also, the phase-insensitive Y response at high spatial frequency was always on-off' and resembled the response obtained at low spatial frequency when the alternating grating was placed 900 away from the peak spatial phase. Both these results were obtained also by Enroth-Cugell & Robson (1966) who used a rather different temporal wave form and temporal frequency. Another interesting aspect of the effect of spatial frequency is that some X cells began to lose the null position when low spatial frequencies were used for the null test. A hint of this can be seen in Fig. 5, at the null response for the X cell when spatial frequency was 0-14 c/deg. At higher spatial frequencies the response at the null position was more nearly null for X cells. This finding was also adumbrated by a result of Enroth-Cugell & Robson (1966): the minimum response of an X cell to introduction and withdrawal of an edge pattern was not totally absent and showed a distinct 'on-off' response (cf."

It should be noted that the space averaged luminance of the stimulus did not vary with time, but that the pattern of spatial nonuniformities in luminance was time-modulated. To study the spatial properties of the ganglion cells, we controlled the position of the grating in the visual field. Since the grating is a periodic stimulus, it is natural to consider the position of the grating in the visual field as equivalent to the spatial phase of the grating with respect to a fixed point in the visual field, e.g. the mid-point of the receptive field of the visual neurone being studied. Formally, for sinusoidal temporal modulation the alternating grating stimulus luminance was Lo+ L1 sin (2rlkx + 0) sin (2irft) where Lo was the mean luminance, L1/L0 was the contrast, k was the spatial frequency in c/deg, x was the position on the screen in degrees of visual angle was the temporal frequency in cls, t was time, and 0 was the spatial phase. For square-wave temporal modulation, the stimulus was Lo + L1 sin (2rlkx+ 0) SIGN (sin 2irft) where SIGN (a) is + 1 if a is positive and -1 if a is negative.

Anaesthesia was induced with ketamine and continued during surgery with sodium thiamylal (Surital), then maintained during the experiment with urethane (0.05 glkg.hr i.v. after a 0-2 g/kg i.v. loading dose). Muscle paralysis was accomplished by infusion ofgallamine triethiodide (10 mg/kg . hr I.v.) and diallyl-bis-nortoxiferine (0-25 mg/kg.hr i.v.), and the cat was artificially respired during the experiment. We also performed a bilateral cervical sympathectomy to reduce eye movements (Rodieck, Pettigrew, Bishop & Nikara, 1967). We gave the cats penicillin and dexamethasone to increase the longevity of the experiment which usually lasted 36 hr with the cat in good condition. After the cat was paralysed and 10% phenylephrine hydrochloride and I% atropine sulphate were applied to the eyes, the optic disks of both eyes were mapped on a tangent screen with an ophthalmoscope (Fernald & Chase, 1971). Contact lenses (+ 2D) with an artificial pupil 3 mm in diameter were than placed on the eye. Then we refracted the cat with the ophthalmoscope to check that it was in focus for a target 50 cm away. Periodically the physiological optics were checked and the eyes irrigated with saline. Occasionally the disks were mapped on the screen at the end of an experiment to ascertain if the eyes had moved significantly. They never were more than 2\u00b0 away from the initial position. The stimuli were produced on the screen of an oscilloscope by means of a set of electronic circuits which are described in detail elsewhere (Shapley & Rossetto, 1976). Patterns were created by the method of Schade (1956); a wave form sychronized to the sweep voltage of a TV type raster was displayed as a visual stimulus on the oscilloscope face by connecting it to the Z axis of the oscilloscope."

Spatial frequency contrast sensitivity functions for the fundamental and second harmonic responses of Y cells to alternating phase gratings were determined. 3. The fundamental spatial frequency response was predicted by the Fourier transform of the sensitivity profile of the Y cell. The high spatial frequency cut\u2010off of a Y cell's fundamental response was in this way related to the centre of the cell's receptive field. 4. The second harmonic response of a Y cell did not cut off at such a low spatial frequency as the fundamental response. This result indicated that the source of the second harmonic was a spatial subunit of the receptive field smaller in spatial extent than the centre. 5. Contrast sensitivity vs. spatial phase for a Y cell was measured under three conditions: a full grating, a grating seen through a centrally located window, a grating partially obscured by a visual shutter. The 2nd/1st harmonic sensitivity ratio went down with the window and up with the shutter. These results implied that the centre of Y cells was linear and also that the nonlinear subunits extended into the receptive field surround. 6. Spatial localization of the nonlinear subunits was determined by means of a spatial dipole stimulus. The nonlinear subunits overlapped the centre and surround of the receptive field and extended beyond both. 7. The nature of the Y cell nonlinearity was found to be rectification, as determined from measurements of the second harmonic response as a function of contrast. 8. Spatial models for the Y cell receptive field are proposed."

                "text": "THE DISCHARGES carried in the optic nerve fibers contain all the information which the central nervous system receives from the retina. A correct interpretation of discharge patterns therefore constitutes an important step in the analysis of visual events. Further, investigations of nervous activity arising in the eye reveal many aspects of the functional organization of the neural elements within the retina itself. Following studies of discharges in the optic nerve of the eel\u2019s eye by Adrian and Matthews (2,3), Hartline and his colleagues described the discharge pattern in the eye of the Limulus in a series of important and lucid papers (for a summary see 20). In the Limulus the relationship between the stimulus to the primary receptor cell and the nerve discharges proved relatively simple, apparently because the connection between sense cell and nerve fiber was a direct one. Thus, when stimulation is confined to one receptor the discharge in a single Limulus nerve fiber will provide a good indication of excitatory events which take place as a result of photochemical processes. Discharges last for the duration of illumination and their frequency is a measure of stimulus strength. Lately, however, it was shown by Hartline et al. (22) that inhibitory interactions may be revealed when several receptors are excited. On the whole, the Limulus preparation shows many features which are similar to other simple sense organs, for instance, stretch receptors. In the latter, however, instead of photochemical events, stretch-deformation acts as the adequate stimulus on sensory terminals and is translated into a characteristic discharge pattern. The discharge from the cold-blooded vertebrate retina (mainly frogs) proved much more complex. Hartline found three main types when recording from single optic nerve fibers: (i) \u201con\u201d discharges, similar to those in the Limulus, firing for the duration of the light stimulus, (ii) \u201coff\u201d discharges appearing when a light stimulus was withdrawn, and (iii) \u2018con-off\u201d discharges, a combination of the former two, with activity confined mainly to onset and cessation of illumination. The mammalian discharge patterns were studied in a number of species by Granit and his co-workers in the course of their extensive work on the physiology of the visual system (summaries in 13, 15). On the whole, they did not observe any fundamental differences between frog and mammalian discharge types (see later)."

A complete enumeration of alpha cell sin one retina yielded a total of 6212. They were encountered in all parts of the retina and had a peak density within the central area (200/mm2). The retinal distribution was displayed as a contour map of alpha\u2010cell density. Away from the central area, the lines of iso\u2010density had the form of a 4\u2010pointed star with rather blunt points corresponding to horizontal and vertical ridges of augmented density. Along horizontal, vertical and oblique strips through the central area, alpha\u2010cell density was an approximately constant fraction of total ganglion cell\u2010density. The averag; value of the fraction was 3.3% from which it has been calculated that the cat's retina may contain as many as 190,000 ganglion cells."

The transformation of external objects into neural images is accomplished by the summation of excitatory and inhibitory influences over the visual field of each neurone. Distortion occurs when the neural response is not simply proportional to the sum of excitation and inhibition because of nonlinear mechanisms in spatial summation. If the responses of all visual cells were distorted by such nonlinear summation, fine visual discriminations like those necessary for reading Nature would be impossible. Nonlinear mechanisms do however, seem to be important in one class of visual neurone, perhaps for signalling change or motion in the external world. We have attempted to understand the importance of the different kinds of spatial summation by studying single cells in the cat visual system."

First, relay cells of the LGNd have either onor off-center receptive fields (16), because each relay cell receives direct excitatory drive from either onor off-center retinal ganglion cells (6, 16). Second, retinal ganglion cells fall into two groups (X-cells and Y-cells) according to whether they sum the influences of the center and surround regions of their receptive fields linearly or nonlinearly (8). Most LGNd relay cells can be similarly classified because most receive direct excitatory drive from either Xor Y-type retinal ganglion cells (6). Third, each relay cell receives direct excitatory drive from either fastor slow-conducting retinal afferents, and its own axon is correspondingly either fast or slow conducting (6, 36). The two latter parameters are closely correlated since Y-cells have been shown to have fast axons and Xcells, slow axons (6, 11). The on/off organization is independent of the other two parameters, however. Roth Y-cells and Xcells can have either onor off-center fields. This report examines several features of the LGNd relay in the normal cat, extending previous concepts and establishing a spectrum of normal properties against which the properties of the LGNd in deprived cats (described in the following paper (3W can be compared. First, the separate relay in the LGNd of the Xand Y-cell activity of the retina is described. Second, several properties of Xand Y-cells of the LGNd were observed to vary con-"

The analog has the form of a color television camera chain feeding electrical signals to a \u201ccomputer\u201d (the brain). Evaluation of characteristics is limited to elements preceding the computer, and particularly to the \u201cluminance channel\u201d of the color system.The primary photoelectric transfer characteristics n\u00af1=f(Er) of the receptors (rods and cones) are computed as a function of retinal illumination (Er) from threshold signal-to-noise ratios in the effective image area of point sources, disks, and other test objects. The effective image area, which is the convolution of the object area with the sampling area of the visual system, is determined from its Fourier spectrum. The constants of the transfer functions are established from the optical constants of the eye, its storage-time function, and the maximum transfer ratio of statistical units of the rod and cone systems. There is little room for variation of constants, if they are to remain in agreement with observed values."
