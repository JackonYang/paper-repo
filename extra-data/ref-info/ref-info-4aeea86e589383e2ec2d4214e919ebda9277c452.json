By making use of a \u2018screw transformation\u2019 they showed that the partition function was the largest eigenvalue of an infinite matrix of simple characteristic structure. In the present paper an alternative method is used for deriving the partition function, and this enables the \u2018screw transformation\u2019 to be generalized to apply to a number of problems of classical statistical mechanics, including the three-dimensional Ising model. Distant neighbour interactions can also be taken into account. The relation between the ferromagnetic and order-disorder problems is discussed, and it is shown that the partition function in both cases can be derived from a single function of two variables. Since distant neighbour interactions can be taken into account the theory can be formally applied to the statistical mechanics of a system of identical particles."

A method is developed which yields the partition function as the largest eigenvalue of some finite matrix, as long as the manifold is only one dimensionally infinite. The method is carried out fully for the linear chain of spins which has no ferromagnetic properties. Then a sequence of finite matrices is found whose largest eigenvalue approaches the partition function of the two-dimensional square net as the matrix order gets large. It is shown that these matrices possess a symmetry property which permits location of the Curie temperature if it exists and is unique. It lies at JkTc=0.8814 if we denote by J the coupling energy between neighboring spins. The symmetry relation also excludes certain forms of singularities at Tc, as, e.g., a jump in the specific heat. However, the information thus gathered by rigorous analytic methods remains incomplete."

In extension of a method due to Onsager it is found that for the case where like atoms attract one another a simple \"reciprocity\" relation exists between the partition functions at pairs of temperatures \"reciprocally\" related to one another. As one temperature $T$ tends to zero, the other ${T}^{*}$ tends to infinity. If one further assumes that only one \"Curie\" transition point exists, the relation between $T$ and ${T}^{*}$ enables one to locate the Curie temperature. Predictions can be made concerning the nature of the transition point with results similar to those of Kramers and Wannier. The reciprocity relation for the case of attraction between like atoms is found to be not valid for the case where unlike atoms attract one another."
