This approach treats face recognition as a two-dimensional recognition problem, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. Face images are projected onto a feature space ('face space') that best encodes the variation among known face images. The face space is defined by the 'eigenfaces', which are the eigenvectors of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to isolated features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The framework provides the ability to learn to recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner.<<ETX>>"

Taking a pattern classification approach, we consider each pixel in an image as a coordinate in a high-dimensional space. We take advantage of the observation that the images of a particular face, under varying illumination but fixed pose, lie in a 3D linear subspace of the high dimensional image space-if the face is a Lambertian surface without shadowing. However, since faces are not truly Lambertian surfaces and do indeed produce self-shadowing, images will deviate from this linear subspace. Rather than explicitly modeling this deviation, we linearly project the image into a subspace in a manner which discounts those regions of the face with large deviation. Our projection method is based on Fisher's linear discriminant and produces well separated classes in a low-dimensional subspace, even under severe variation in lighting and facial expressions. The eigenface technique, another method based on linearly projecting the image space to a low dimensional subspace, has similar computational requirements. Yet, extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed \"Fisherface\" method has error rates that are lower than those of the eigenface technique for tests on the Harvard and Yale face databases."

Such clustering requirements are generic to a number of problems in computer vision.We extend existing techniques for affine-invariant clustering, and show that the new distance metric outperforms existing approximations to affine invariant distance computation, particularly under large transformations. In addition, we incorporate prior probabilities on the transformation parameters. This further regularizes the solution, mitigating a rare but serious tendency of the existing solutions to diverge. For the particular special case of corresponding point sets we demonstrate that the affine invariant measure we introduced may be obtained in closed form.As an application of these ideas we demonstrate that the faces of the principal cast of a feature film can be generated automatically using clustering with appropriate invariance. This is a very demanding test as it involves detecting and clustering over tens of thousands of images with the variances including changes in viewpoint, lighting, scale and expression."

Our model representation is based on two layers. The first one consists of \"generic\" descriptors which represent sets of similar rotational invariant feature vectors. Rotation invariance allows to group similar, but rotated patterns and makes the method robust to model deformations. The second layer is the joint probability on the frequencies of the \"generic\" descriptors over neighborhoods. This probability is multi-modal and is represented by a set of \"spatial-frequency\" clusters. It adds a statistical spatial constraint which is rotationally invariant. Our two-layer representation is novel; it allows to efficiently capture \"texture-like\" visual structure. The selection of distinctive structure determines characteristic model features (common to the positive and rare in the negative examples) and increases the performance of the model. Models are retrieved and localized using a probabilistic score. Experimental results for \"textured\" animals and faces show a very good performance for retrieval as well as localization."

Learning the joint distribution of image regions and words has many applications. We consider in detail predicting words associated with whole images (auto-annotation) and corresponding to particular image regions (region naming). Auto-annotation might help organize and access large collections of images. Region naming is a model of object recognition as a process of translating image regions to words, much as one might translate from one language to another. Learning the relationships between image regions and semantic correlates (words) is an interesting example of multi-modal data mining, particularly because it is typically hard to apply data mining techniques to collections of images. We develop a number of models for the joint distribution of image regions and words, including several which explicitly learn the correspondence between regions and words. We study multi-modal and correspondence extensions to Hofmann's hierarchical clustering/aspect model, a translation model adapted from statistical machine translation (Brown et al.), and a multi-modal extension to mixture of latent Dirichlet allocation (MoM-LDA). All models are assessed using a large collection of annotated images of real scenes. We study in depth the difficult problem of measuring performance. For the annotation task, we look at prediction performance on held out data. We present three alternative measures, oriented toward different types of task. Measuring the performance of correspondence methods is harder, because one must determine whether a word has been placed on the right region of an image. We can use annotation performance as a proxy measure, but accurate measurement requires hand labeled data, and thus must occur on a smaller scale. We show results using both an annotation proxy, and manually labeled data."

We incorporate statistical natural language processing in order to deal with free text. We demonstrate the current system on a difficult dataset, namely 10000 images of work from the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco. The images include line drawings, paintings, and pictures of sculpture and ceramics. Many of the images have associated free text which varies greatly from physical description to interpretation and mood. We use WordNet to provide semantic grouping information and to help disambiguate word senses, as well as emphasize the hierarchical nature of semantic relationships. This allows us to impose a natural structure on the image collection that reflects semantics to a considerable degree. Our method produces a joint probability distribution for words and picture elements. We demonstrate that this distribution can be used: (a) to provide illustrations for given captions, and (b) to generate words for images outside the training set. Results from this annotation process yield a quantitative study of our method. Finally, the annotation process can be seen as a form of object recognizer that has been learned through a partially supervised process."

With few exceptions, however, most research has been limited to training and testing on frontal views. Little is known about the extent to which face pose, illumination, expression, occlusion, and individual differences, such as those associated with gender, influence recognition accuracy. We systematically varied these factors to test the performance of two leading algorithms, one template based and the other feature based. Image data consisted of over 21000 images from 3 publicly available databases: CMU PIE, Cohn-Kanade, and AR databases. In general, both algorithms were robust to variation in illumination and expression. Recognition accuracy was highly sensitive to variation in pose. For frontal training images, performance was attenuated beginning at about 15 degrees. Beyond about 30 degrees, performance became unacceptable. For non-frontal training images, fall off was more severe. Small but consistent differences were found for individual differences in subjects. These findings suggest direction for future research, including design of experiments and data collection."

To account for these variations, the algorithm simulates the process of image formation in 3D space, using computer graphics, and it estimates 3D shape and texture of faces from single images. The estimate is achieved by fitting a statistical, morphable model of 3D faces to images. The model is learned from a set of textured 3D scans of heads. We describe the construction of the morphable model, an algorithm to fit the model to images, and a framework for face identification. In this framework, faces are represented by model parameters for 3D shape and texture. We present results obtained with 4,488 images from the publicly available CMU-PIE database and 1,940 images from the FERET database."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

In appearance-based object recognition, the features are chosen to be the pixel intensity values in an image of the object. These pixel intensities correspond directly to the radiance of light emitted from the object along certain rays in space. The set of all such radiance values over all possible rays is known as the plenoptic function or light-field. In this paper, we develop a theory of appearance-based object recognition from light-fields. This theory leads directly to an algorithm for face recognition across pose that uses as many images of the face as are available, from one upwards. All of the pixels, whichever image they come from, are treated equally and used to estimate the (eigen) light-field of the object. The eigen light-field is then used as the set of features on which to base recognition, analogously to how the pixel intensities are used in appearance-based face and object recognition."

The method consists of two steps: first we project the face image from the original vector space to a face subspace via PCA, second we use LDA to obtain a best linear classifier. The basic idea of combining PCA and LDA is to improve the generalization capability of LDA when only few samples per class are available. Using PCA, we are able to construct a face subspace in which we apply LDA to perform classification. Using FERET dataset we demonstrate a significant improvement when principal components rather than original images are fed to the LDA classifier. The hybrid classifier using PCA and LDA provides a useful framework for other image recognition tasks as well."

The representation in PCA is based on the second order statistics of the image set, and does not address higher order statistical dependencies such as the relationships among three or more pixels. Higher order statistics (HOS) have been used as a more informative low dimensional representation than PCA for face and vehicle detection. We investigate a generalization of PCA, kernel principal component analysis (kernel PCA), for learning low dimensional representations in the context of face recognition. In contrast to HOS, kernel PCA computes the higher order statistics without the combinatorial explosion of time and memory complexity. While PCA aims to find a second order correlation of patterns, kernel PCA provides a replacement which takes into account higher order correlations. We compare the recognition results using kernel methods with eigenface methods on two benchmarks. Empirical results show that kernel PCA outperforms the eigenface method in face recognition."

The video sequence need not have any form of special background. Animals are modeled as a 2D kinematic chain of rectangular segments, where the number of segments and the topology of the chain are unknown. The system detects possible segments, clusters segments whose appearance is coherent over time, and then builds a spatial model of such segment clusters. The resulting representation of the spatial configuration of the animal in each frame can be seen either as a track - in which case the system described should be viewed as a generalized tracker, that is capable of modeling objects while tracking them - or as the source of an appearance model which can be used to build detectors for the particular animal. This is because knowing a video sequence is temporally coherent - i.e. that a particular animal is present through the sequence - is a strong supervisory signal. The method is shown to be successful as a tracker on video sequences of real scenes showing three different animals. For the same reason it is successful as a tracker, the method results in detectors that can be used to find each animal fairly reliably within the Corel collection of images."

However, due to the computational demands of these approaches, applications to large problems such as spatiotemporal data and high resolution imagery have been slow to appear. The contribution of this paper is a method that substantially reduces the computational requirements of grouping algorithms based on spectral partitioning making it feasible to apply them to very large grouping problems. Our approach is based on a technique for the numerical solution of eigenfunction problems known as the Nystrom method. This method allows one to extrapolate the complete grouping solution using only a small number of samples. In doing so, we leverage the fact that there are far fewer coherent groups in a scene than pixels."

We show that an approximation to the eigendecomposition of the Gram matrix can be computed by the Nystrom method (which is used for the numerical solution of eigenproblems). This is achieved by carrying out an eigendecomposition on a smaller system of size m < n, and then expanding the results back up to n dimensions. The computational complexity of a predictor using this approximation is O(m2n). We report experiments on the USPS and abalone data sets and show that we can set m \u226a n without any significant decrease in the accuracy of the solution."
