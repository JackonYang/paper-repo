But the impracticality of the naive evaluation procedure as it stands raises the questions: How can one decide which practical measure is likely to yield results most closely resembling those of the naive methodology? And how can one tell whether the resemblance is close enough to make applying the measure worth while? In the present paper two kinds of solution to these problems are taken up. The first answers the questions in terms of the reasonableness of the simplifying assumptions needed to get from the naive measure to the proposed substitute. The second answers it by experimentation."

The major problem appears to lie in the way the principle considers each document independently of the rest. The nature of the information on the basis of which the system decides whether or not to retrieve the documents determines whether the document\u2010by\u2010document approach is valid."

Relevance is considered as a measure of the effectiveness of a contact between a source and a destination in a communication process. The different views of relevance that emerged are interpreted and related within a framework of communication of knowledge. Different views arose because relevance was considered at a number of different points in the process of knowledge communication. It is suggested that there exists an interlocking, interplaying cycle of various systems of relevances."
