Structured databases are therefore created to store the items contairung enough information to identify and retneve the onginal documents. This paper proposes an extension of classification and indexing to pictorial data, specifically to pictorial parts of multimedia documents. This goal is attained by adopting structural techniques for digital image description. The de scriptions of the objects (digital structures) present in the image are proposed as pictorial index terms. Such a generaliza tion has led to a uniform management of the non-homoge neous kinds of data composing the document and has allowed the outlining of a multimedia IR system raised from interdisci plinary experiences. In the paper the approach to image description is presented and a control structure to index textual and pictorial data is discussed."

This paper describes and compares printed visual dictionaries and current state-of-the art visual retrieval systems. We critically examine the assumptions upon which such systems are constructed, and explore some ways in which images can be used in a text-free information system, and propose some areas here further inquiry is needed. We also present a prototype for a hypermedia visual thesaurus. Those who catalog objects are just now beginning to recognize the Inadequacy of verbal language as a means of recording descriptive information on material culture or the physical world in general. The use of non-verbal representations has great potential to address the limitations of text-based taxonomies. The use of authority control and thesauri are an essentail part on any successful informationsysem. lnthis paper, we have briefly described some of the implications of a similar process for visual media."

In using the entity-attribute-rela tionship model, the main semantic concepts of entity. at tribute and relationship can be represented in a simple man ner which correspond very closely to the noun, adjective and verb which are the essential components of a simple descrip tion of a picture. Such a system has the advantage over traditional ways of representing the data in an automated system in that it allows, inter aha, the concept of relationships between two (or more) objects to be successfully represented in the database. Our basic starting point is man-machine cooperation in which the pattern processing capability of the human eye is fully exploited As a result, it should provide a much better degree of flexibility in the identification of com plex patterns. Evaluation experiments carried out on a proto type system based on this approach are able to yield precision and recall performances of over 62% and 88% respectively."

However, the advent of an electronic means of managing pictures and 'images' has drastically changed and improved the possibilities for such management. The rapidly falling costs of the technology means that electronic image management is now within the sights of most libraries, art galleries and museums, and is being considered by many organisations new to the field. This book aims to explain the astonishing progress, increasing complexity, and the pervasive jargon of the technology, and is aimed at those with some but not a detailed knowledge of information technology. It is hoped that armed with information on the current state of technology and its implications, the potential buyer and user of picture management equipment will face these decisions with confidence, and therefore manage images more successfully."

The system's operation is improved by image processing techniques and parallel processing technology. Although image processing is largely a well understood problem, the technology for supporting it is still immature. Basically, it is a highly computationally intensive activity, and the purpose of our project was to address this very problem using parallel processing technology in the form of transputers. More specifically, we will describe the use of a transputer network in the development of an image database consisting of a collection of historical museum photographs. During the first phase of the project, we developed a prototype system consisting of a small number of photographs using a simple hardware configuration. It made use of the hard disk of the PC to store the photographs and was implemented using a single transputer. During the second phase, the full hardware configuration was implemented, including the building up of the database of around 1,000 photographs. The final system consists of an IBM-compatible PC equipped with the necessary image processing and mass storage facilities (650 Mb hard disk) and linked to a network of six transputers. The user interface is provided through a serial mouse and a keyword menu. Users are able to retrieve images in three different modes: (i) a predefined keyword list, which is arranged in a hierarchical fashion to select images relating to a particular subject or geographical area; (ii) the Browse mode allows the user to display a set of up to twelve photographs in miniature \u2018stub\u2019 format at one go (this is similar to the turning of the pages of an album). Individual items can then be selected and displayed in full size, if necessary; (iii) if the museum reference number is known, the user can type in the number to retrieve the relevant item. Section 1 will provide a brief review of the background to the project and the use of transputer technology in image processing. The selection and documentation of the photographs are described in Section 2. Section 3 describes the hardware and software configuration of the single-transputer-based prototype, and the full image database system implemented on a network of transputers. The organisation of the database, both textual and image data, is explained in Section 4. This is followed by a description of the processing techniques for image enhancement and compression, and a discussion of the results of both compression and decompression processes. The final section will discuss the menu-based, mouse-driven user interface, including the various search facilities and display modes used to view images from the database."

This paper represents a first attempt to apply and optimise relevance feedback techniques to improve retrieval in a text-based image archival system. The design exploits the rapid assessment possible with image data to facilitate query refinement and collect large amounts of relevance feedback data This data can then be used to extend incomplete image descriptions, thus ameliorat ing problems associated with text annotation of images. Visu ally oriented relevance feedback and query modification is implemented using direct mampulation of icons. An algorithm designed for dynamic modification of image descriptions based on relevance feedback is proposed, implemented, and experi mentally tested. Initial experiments show significant improve ments and demonstrate the potential of using these tech niques for image retrieval applications."

There have been a number of approaches to the pictorial database retrieval problem, and recent surveys of image databases in general may be found. In the present approach, it is considered that, in the same way as a knowledge-based language like Prolog can be used to represent general as well as specific knowledge in a versatile manner, a suitable Picture Representation Language (PRL) may be developed to systematically encode knowledge about the contents of pictures, which can then the stored for subsequent processing"

Collections of pictures, archival materials and maps can be stored by capturing the images on video and transferring the frames to a database on a microcomputer. The description and the image can be viewed together when searching the materials. The research project described here considers the quality of the pictures in the image database, as well as time calculations for image database production.

This article asks whether the use of the iconographic classification system ICONCLASS will help to create countable iconographic information. Its first part deals with the considerations that have guided the shape of the computer edition that has recently been made available. These may be relevant for the electronic publication of classification systems in general. In the second part a few statement about gestures are analyzed against the background of an existing corpus of systematically described images . This analysis draws attention to the paradox that iconographic detail often plays a key role in art historical discourse, but must do so on the basis of incidental information"

The fact that in the past photograph collections have often been a largely disregarded aspect of a library or archive's resources has caused the contents to be uninvestigated and therefore not able to be made available to scholars and researchers. The special factors involved in organizing, storing and using these often fragile prints pose problems that necessitate treating photographs as a separate entity from the main body of a library or archive of manuscript material. The inherent vulnerability of photographic emulsions to decay and chemical decomposition (problems often exacerbated by the original mounting of prints into albums and on card with unsuitable glues) has not been entirely overcome by modern conservation techniques, but enough has been done to enable most institutions at least to minimize harmful storage methods while still keeping material available for inspection and use. The ever-increasing demand for photographs by publishers, scholars and the visual media generally has led a number of libraries to contemplate programmes of comprehensive cataloguing and indexing, several of which are in progress now."

One of these projects could be the Witt Library pilot project, discussed elsewhere in this issue of the Art Libraries Journal (pp. 27-31). In this paper the classification as such is briefly explained, mainly with the help of two examples: scenes from the stories of St. Antony Abbot and Hercules. Information on the alphabetical index to the classification is given, mainly because this extensive part of Iconclass is something more than the usual index to a publication. Applications of the classification are dealt with in diagrammatic form; one application, the Iconclass bibliography, is discussed in greater detail."

The problem of pictorial information retrieval then becomes a problem of 2-D subsequence matching. We present algorithms for encoding a symbolic picture into its 2-D string representation, reconstructing a picture from its 2-D string representation, and matching a 2-D string with another 2-D string. We also prove the necessary and sufficient conditions to characterize ambiguous pictures for reduced 2-D strings as well as normal 2-D strings.

In the preceding decades the new medium was beginning to make its impact on society and the NFA was faced with the formidable task of preserving the nation's moving image heritage. With the passage of time more formats were developed and production increased, creating problems for the NFA and the other collections, especially regional and special archives, which had been established. As film, television and video grew in importance demands for greater access to archives and libraries increased as new user groups challenged the status quo. This paper reviews the trends in the collection and use of moving images during the fifty year period between 1935 and 1985, concentrating on non\u2010fiction material."

The new 3-D shape-indexing method uses superquadrics. First, the requirements for 3-D indexing are given. From an estimation of 3-D modeling methods, the superquadric model is found to be most suitable, and its performance is discussed. Applications of this 3-D indexing method to man-machine communications are given. first, the authors show that a modeled 3-D object can be easily deformed by verbal instruction, such as 'rounder' and 'squarer'. Second, they prove that the shape abstraction of a 3-D object is easily created from two rough sketches showing the cross-sections of the object. And finally, an experimental 3-D image database system that makes good use of this indexing method is created. This new indexing method promises to revolutionize 3-D visual communication and database systems.<<ETX>>"

While few people would have difficulty recognizing the milestone images stored here, the majority of the collection serves a variety of very specific interests. Access to these images has long suffered from limited intellectual control, but currently an effort is underway to remedy this situation. This article will provide background information on the recent state of the Film Archives and will discuss the goals and methodology of the effort to establish intellectual control over the storage and retrieval of images in this collection."

In the decade since it was begun, however, attitudes toward the use of terminology to describe visual images and museum objects have changed, impelling AAT constructors to develop policies that would make the thesaurus flexible enough to meet the needs of a new generation of database producers. This article describes the processes and policies that were developed to construct a language that would represent knowledge in the field of art and architecture as well as be surrogates for the images and objects being described.

The nature of a paradigm is outlined and the fundamental sense of a paradigm as an exemplar is identified. The applicability of the paradigm concept to a multi\u2010disciplinary field such as information science is discussed and it is concluded that paradigms can be a legitimate feature of information science though they may not be connected with the development of normal science. The features of two paradigms operating in information retrieval research, (1) the physical paradigm and (2) the cognitive paradigm are outlined, and their origins, nature and role examined. It is argued that although most work in information retrieval research takes place within the physical and cognitive paradigms, neither provides the basis for a powerful paradigm directed science. An explanation for the failure to develop a powerful body of theory articulated within a well developed paradigmatic framework is offered with reference to the inherent categorial duality of the field."

All in all the best book now available on symbols.\" --Library Journal This unparalleled reference represents a major achievement in the field of graphic design. Famed industrial designer Henry Dreyfuss recognized the importance of symbols in communicating more quickly and effectively; for many years he and his staff collected and codified graphic symbols as they are used in all walks of life throughout the world. The result is this \"dictionary\" of universally used graphic symbols. Henry Dreyfuss designed this sourcebook to be as practical and easy to use as possible by arranging the symbol information within ingeniously devised sections: Basic Symbols represents a concise and highly selective grouping of symbols common to all disciplines (on-off, up-down, etc.). Disciplines provides symbols used in accommodations and travel, agriculture, architecture, business, communications, engineering, photography, sports, safety, traffic controls, and many other areas. Color lists the meanings of each of the colors in various worldwide applications and cultures. Graphic Form displays symbols from all disciplines grouped according to form (squares, circles, arrows, human figures, etc.) creating a unique way to identify a symbol out of context, as well as giving designers a frame of reference for developing new symbols. To make the sourcebook truly universal, the Table of Contents contains translations of each of the section titles and discipline areas into 17 languages in addition to English."

Panofsky's historical technique reveals an abundance of detail, detail he skillfully relates to the life and work of individual painters and their times. The papers in this volume represent a cross-section of Panofsky's major work. Included are selections from his well-known \"Studies in Iconology\" and \"The Life and Art of Albrecht Durer,\" plus an introduction and an epilogue-\"The History of Art as a Humanistic Discipline\" and \"Three Decades of Art History in the United States: Impressions of a Transplanted European\"-as well as pieces written especially for this collection. All display Panofsky's vast erudition and deep commitment to a humanistic conception of art and art history.\""

This article presents an overall approach to developing viable image CHI involving user metaphors for comprehending image data, and methods for locating, accessing, and displaying computer images. Since medical\u2010image applications involve almost all image display problems, a medical\u2010image radiology\u2010workstation application is used as a driving example to present critical image CHI issues. \u00a9 1991 John Wiley & Sons, Inc."

Section 2 of this concise report outlines the impact of new technology on scholarship (text, data, images, sound, combined sources, electronic communication, tools); section 3 discusses new developments and the change of the traditional image of the humanities scholar, section 4 describes training and support, network access and equipment, research infrastructure, information resources, regulatory issues and funding; section 5 summarises the recommendations of the Panel."

We look at general image quality issues including image capture, resolution, and display, and then turn our attention to the uses of imaging technology for conservation and preservation purposes.
