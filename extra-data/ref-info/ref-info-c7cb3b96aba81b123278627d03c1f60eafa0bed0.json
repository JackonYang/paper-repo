In this paper we present an approach that uses color as a cue to perform selection either based solely on image-data (data-driven), or based on the knowledge of the color description of the model (model-driven). Specifically, the paper presents a method of color specification in terms of perceptual color categories and shows its relevance for the task of selection. The color categories are used to develop a fast region segmentation algorithm that extracts perceptual color regions in images. The color regions extracted form the basis for performing data and model-driven selection. Data-driven selection is achieved by selecting salient color regions as judged by a color-saliency measure that emphasizes attributes that are also important in human color perception. The approach to model-driven selection, on the other hand, exploits the color and other region information in the 3d model object to locate instances of the object in a given image. The approach presented tolerates some of the problems of occlusion, pose and illumination changes that make a model instance in an image appear different from its original description. Finally, the utility of color-based selection is demonstrated by showing the extent of search reduction possible when color-based selection is integrated with a recognition system."

This segmentation is useful for many visual tasks including 3-D inspection and 3-D object recognition. The segmentation algorithm is based on a detailed analysis of the physics underlying color image formation and may be applied to images of a wide range of materials and surface textures. An initial edge detection on the intensity image is used to guide the segmentation process and to ensure accurate localization of region boundaries. The algorithm is based on the computation of local image features and can be mapped effectively onto high-performance parallel hardware. Issues related to illumination and sensors are addressed. Experimental results obtained for several images are presented. >"

In evaluating these problems, a technique based on an active contour model commonly called a snake is examined. The technique is applied to cell locomotion and tracking studies. The snake permits both the segmentation and tracking problems to be simultaneously solved in constrained cases. A detailed analysis of the snake model, emphasizing its limitations and shortcomings, is presented, and improvements to the original description of the model are proposed. Problems of convergence of the optimization scheme are considered. In particular, an improved terminating criterion for the optimization scheme that is based on topographic features of the graph of the intensity image is proposed. Hierarchical filtering methods, as well as a continuation method based on a discrete sale-space representation, are discussed. Results for both segmentation and tracking are presented. Possible failures of the method are discussed. >"

The overall goal is to present a theoretical analysis connecting many established theories of color constancy. For the case where surface reflectances are two-dimensional and illuminants are three-dimensional, it is proved that perfect color constancy can always be solved for by an independent adjustment of sensor responses, which means that the color constancy transform can be expressed as a diagonal matrix. In addition to purely theoretical arguments, results from simulations of diagonal-matrix-based color constancy, in which the spectra of real illuminants and reflectances along with the human cone sensitivity functions were used, are presented. The simulations demonstrate that when the cone sensor space is transformed to its new basis in the appropriate manner, a diagonal matrix supports close to optimal color constancy.<<ETX>>"
