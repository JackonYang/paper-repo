It builds a three-dimensional model of the task domain and uses hypothesized two-dimensional views of the model to label images. It currently achieves less than 20% error by area when labeling real-world (city of Pittsburgh) photographs with a knowledge base of over fifty objects. In addition, the system can determine the angle of view around the city with approximately 40 degrees of error. The labeling technique used by ARGOS is called Locus search. Locus is a non-backtracking graph search technique in which a beam of near-miss alternatives around the best path are extended in parallel through the graph. After the graph has been searched in breadth-first order, the beam of possibilities is examined in reverse order to extract a near-optimal path. This path defines a labeling of the image and is only sub-optimal because of the pruning heuristics used in the beam creation. This thesis formulates image understanding as a problem of search; shows how Locus search can be used to label images; describes the many sources of knowledge used in the interpretation; shows how knowledge represented as a network can be used to constrain the search; explores extensions to the use of knowledge; and presents the experimental results of ARGOS. Its main contributions are the demonstration that Locus search can be used for image understanding and the exploration of issues involved in this use."

Techniques for segmenting an object into sub-parts and generating structured, symbolic, graph like descriptions are described. These symbolic descriptions are matched with stored descriptions and the best match is picked for recognition.

Its major application, to date, has been to the interpretation of visual features (such as regions) in scene analysis. In this application, features are assigned sets of possible interpretations with associated likelihoods based on local attributes (e.g., color, size, and shape). Interpretations are related by rules of inference that adjust the likelihoods up or down in accordance with the interpretation likelihoods of related features. An asynchronous relaxation process repeatedly applies the rules until a consistent set of likelihood values is attained. At this point, several alternative interpretations still exist for each feature. One feature is chosen and the most likely of its alternatives is assumed. The rules are then used in this more precise context to determine likelihoods for the interpretations of remaining features by a further round of relaxation. The selection and relaxation steps are repeated until all features have been interpreted."

                "text": "This paper is a condensed version of the author's thesis [Bolles 1976], which investigates a subclass of visual information processing referred to as verification vision (abbreviated VV). VV uses a model of a scene to locate objects of interest in a picture of the scene. The characteristics that distinguish VV from the other types of visual information processing are: (1) the system has a great deal of prior knowledge about the type, placement, and appearance of the objects that form the scene and (2) the goal is to verify and refine the location of one or more objects in the scene. VV includes a significant portion of the visual feedback tasks required within programmable assembly. For example, locating a screw hole and determining the relative displacement between a screw and the screw hole are both VV tasks. Two types of VV tasks are discussed in the thesis: inspection and location. This paper only discusses location tasks, but essentially the same capabilities are required for both types of tasks. \n \nThis paper describes (1) a structure for a VV system that makes it easier for programmers who are not experts in computer vision to program VV feedback, and (2) a set of combination rules that are capable of using the results of several different types of operators to estimate the confidences and precisions that are necessary within VV. \n \nAn interactive VV system based upon these ideas has been implemented. It helps the programmer select potentially useful operator/feature pairs, provides a training session to gather statistics on the behavior of the operators, automatically ranks the operator/feature pairs according to their expected contributions, and performs the desired task. The VV system has also been interfaced to the AL control system for the mechanical arms and has been tested on tasks that involve a combination of touch, force, and visual feedback."

In this paper, we apply this approach to the problem of representing three-dimensional shapes for the purpose of recognition. 1. Three criteria, accessibility, scope and uniqueness, and stability and sensitivity, are presented for judging the usefulness of a representation for shape recognition. 2. Three aspects of a representation\u2019s design are considered, (i) the representation\u2019s coordinate system, (ii) its primitives, which are the primary units of shape information used in the representation, and (iii) the organization the representation imposes on the information in its descriptions. 3. In terms of these design issues and the criteria presented, a shape representation for recognition should: (i) use an object-centred coordinate system, (ii) include volumetric primitives of varied sizes, and (iii) have a modular organization. A representation based on a shape\u2019s natural axes (for example the axes identified by a stick figure) follows directly from these choices. 4. The basic process for deriving a shape description in this representation must involve: (i) a means for identifying the natural axes of a shape in its image and (ii) a mechanism for transforming viewer-centred axis specifications to specifications in an object-centred coordinate system. 5. Shape recognition involves: (i) a collection of stored shape descriptions, and (ii) various indexes into the collection that allow a newly derived description to be associated with an appropriate stored description. The most important of these indexes allows shape recognition to proceed conservatively from the general to the specific based on the specificity of the information available from the image. 6. New constraints supplied by a conservative recognition process can be used to extract more information from the image. A relaxation process for carrying out this constraint analysis is described."

Complex objects are represented as structures joining parts called generalized cylinders. These primitives are formalized in a volume representation by an arbitrary cross section varying along a space curve axis. Several types of joint structures are discussed. Experimental results are shown for the description (building of internal computer models) of a handful of complex objects, beginning with laser range data from actual objects. Our programs have generated complete descriptions of rings, cones, and snake-like objects, all of which may be described by a single primitive. Complex objects, such as dolls, have been segmented into parts, most of which are well described by programs which implement generalized cylinder descriptions."

Therefore, implicit in the perceptual analysis of occluding contour must lie various assumptions about the viewed surfaces. The assumptions that seem most natural are (a) that the distinction between convex and concave segments reflects real properties of the viewed surface; and (b) that contiguous portions of contour arise from contiguous parts of the viewed surface \u2013 i. e. there are no invisible obscuring edges. It is proved that, for smooth surfaces, these assumptions are essentially equivalent to assuming that the viewed surface is a generalized cone. Methods are defined for finding the axis of such a cone, and for segmenting a surface constructed of several cones into its components, whose axes can then be found separately. These methods provide one link between an uninterpreted figure extracted from an image, and the 3-D representation theory of Marr & Nishihara (1977)."
