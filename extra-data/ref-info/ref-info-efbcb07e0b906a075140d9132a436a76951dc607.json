In this paper we describe a general solution to the problem of recognizing the structure of a detected table region. First hierarchial clustering is used to identify columns and then spatial and lexical criteria to classify headers. We also address the problem of evaluating table structure recognition. Our model is based on a directed acyclic attribute graph, or table DAG. We describe a new paradigm, 'random graph probing,' for comparing the results returned by the recognition system and the representation created during ground-truthing. Probing is in fact a general concept that could be applied to other document recognition tasks and perhaps even other computer vision problems as well."

The authors propose an efficient and effective graph manipulation technique that can be used in graph-based similarity search. Given a query graph G/sub q/ (V,E), they would like to determine fast which are the graphs in the database that are similar to G/sub q/ (V,E), with respect to a similarity measure. First, they study the similarity measure between two graphs. Then, they discuss graph representation techniques by means of multidimensional vectors. It is shown that no false dismissals are introduced by using the vector representation. Finally they illustrate some representative queries that can be handled by their approach, and present experimental results, based on the proposed graph similarity algorithm. The results show that considerable savings are obtained with respect to computational effort and I/O operations, in comparison to conventional searching techniques."

Past experience with standard datasets providing ground-truth for character recognition and page segmentation tasks supports this belief.

This problem may, in fact, be much more difficult than it appears. We present a detailed analysis of why table ground-truthing is so hard, including the notions that there may exist more than one acceptable \"truth\" and/or incomplete or partial \"truths\"."
