First, overt adjustments of gaze direction can be made to control which regions of the visual scene are processed by the sensitive fovea and its associated neural machinery. Second, covert adjustments can be made to determine which specific objects or regions are selected (in the absence of gaze changes) for preferential treatment. Overt orienting can be directly observed in the form of eye movements; convert orienting involves an internal adjustment and must be inferred from performance patterns. James (1890) probably had a distinction of this sort in mind when he contrasted adjustment of the sensory organs with an internal \u201canticipatory preparation.\u201d"

Displays of 10 alphanumeric characters were presented and, after a brief offset, were presented again in the same position, with or without a change in a single character. Subjects\u2019 accuracy in change detection did not suggest preservation of any more information than is usually available in whole report, except with the briefest of offsets (under 50 msec). Stimulus duration had only modest effects. The interaction of masking with offset duration followed the pattern previously observed with unfamiliar visual stimuli (Phillips, 1974). Accuracy was not reduced by reflection of the characters about a horizontal axis, suggesting that categorical information contributed negligibly. Detection of change appears to depend upon capacity-limited visual memory; (putative) knowledge of what identities are present in different display locations does not seem to contribute."

Two studies are reported which suggest that, while certain aspects of attention require that locations be scanned serially, at least one operation may be carried out in parallel across several independent loci in the visual field. That is the operation of indexing features and tracking their identity. The studies show that: (a) subjects are able to track a subset of up to 5 objects in a field of 10 identical randomly-moving objects in order to distinguish a change in a target from a change in a distractor; and (b) when the speed and distance parameters of the display are designed so that, on the basis of some very conservative assumptions about the speed of attention movement and encoding times, the predicted performance of a serial scanning and updating algorithm would not exceed about 40% accuracy, subjects still manage to do the task with 87% accuracy. These findings are discussed in relation to an earlier, and independently motivated model of feature-binding--called the FINST model--which posits a primitive identity maintenance mechanism that indexes and tracks a limited number of visual objects in parallel. These indexes are hypothesized to serve the function of binding visual features prior to subsequent pattern recognition."

In this paper I will discuss several defects of vision and the classical theories of how they are overcome. I will criticize these theories and suggest an alternative approach, in which the outside world is considered as a kind of external memory store which can be accessed instantaneously by casting one's eyes (or one's attention) to some location. The feeling of the presence and extreme richness of the visual world is, under this view, a kind of illusion, created by the immediate availability of the information in this external store."

Although existing theories of metacontrast and pattern masking say \u201cno,\u201d we report this occurs when targets appear in unpredictable locations. In three experiments, a four-dot mask was compared with a standard metacontrast mask that surrounded the target. Although accuracy was predictably different for the two masks at a central display location in Experiment I, both masks had similar strong effects on accuracy in parafoveal locations. Experiment 2 revealed that both four-dot and metacontrast masking were insensitive to contour proximity in parafoveal display locations, and Experiment 3 showed that four-dot masking could occur even at a central location if attention was distributed among several targets. We propose that targets in unattended locations are coded with low spotiotemporal resolution, leaving them vulnerable to substitution by the four dots when attention is directed to them."

This paper explores one aspect of cognition through the use of a simple model task in which human subjects are asked to commit attention to a position in visual space other than fixation. This instruction is executed by orienting a covert (attentional) mechanism that seems sufficiently time locked to external events that its trajectory can be traced across the visual field in terms of momentary changes in the efficiency of detecting stimuli. A comparison of results obtained with alert monkeys, brain injured and normal human subjects shows the relationship of this covert system to saccadic eye movements and to various brain systems controlling perception and motion. In accordance with Bartlett's insight, the possibility is explored that similar principles apply to orienting of attention toward sensory input and orienting to the semantic structures used in thinking."

                "text": "There are three senses in which a visual stimulus may be said to persist psychologically for some time after its physical offset. First, neural activity in the visual system evoked by the stimulus may continue after stimulus offset (\u201cneural persistence\u201d). Second, the stimulus may continue to be visible for some time after its offset (\u201cvisible persistence\u201d). Finally, information about visual properties of the stimulus may continue to be available to an observer for some time after stimulus offset (\u201cinformational persistence\u201d). These three forms of visual persistence are widely assumed to reflect a single underlying process: a decaying visual trace that (1) consists of afteractivity in the visual system, (2) is visible, and (3) is the source of visual information in experiments on decaying visual memory. It is argued here that this assumption is incorrect. Studies of visible persistence are reviewed; seven different techniques that have been used for investigating visible persistence are identified, and it is pointed out that numerous studies using a variety of techniques have demonstrated two fundamental properties of visible persistence: theinverse duration effect (the longer a stimulus lasts, the shorter is its persistence after stimulus offset) and theinverse intensity effect (the more intense the stimulus, the briefer its persistence). Only when stimuli are so intense as to produce afterimages do these two effects fail to occur. Work on neural persistences is briefly reviewed; such persistences exist at the photoreceptor level and at various stages in the visual pathways. It is proposed that visible persistence depends upon both of these types of neural persistence; furthermore, there must be an additional neural locus, since a purely stereoscopic (and hence cortical) form of visible persistence exists. It is argued that informational persistence is defined by the use of the partial report methods introduced by Averbach and Coriell (1961) and Sperling (1960), and the term \u201ciconic memory\u201d is used to describe this form of persistence. Several studies of the effects of stimulus duration and stimulus intensity upon the duration of iconic memory have been carried out. Their results demonstrate that the duration of iconic memory is not inversely related to stimulus duration or stimulus intensity. It follows that informational persistence or iconic memory cannot be identified with visible persistence, since they have fundamentally different properties. One implication of this claim that one cannot investigate iconic memory by tasks that require the subject to make phenomenological judgments about the duration of a visual display. In other words, the so-called \u201cdirect methods\u201d for studying iconic memory do not provide information about iconic memory. Another implication is that iconic memory is not intimately tied to processes going on in the visual system (as visible persistence is); provided a stimulus is adequately legible, its physical parameters have little influence upon its iconic memory. The paper concludes by pointing out that there exists an alternative to the usual view of iconic memory as a precategorical sensory buffer. According to this alternative, iconic memory is post-categorical, occurring subsequent to stimulus identification. Here, stimulus identification is considered to be a rapid automatic process which does not require buffer storage, but which provides no information about episodic properties of a visual stimulus. Information about these physical stimulus properties must, in some way, be temporarily attached to a representation of the stimulus in semantic memory; and it is this temporarily attached physical information which constitutes iconic memory."

In two experiments, sequences of 16 color photographs were presented at rates of 113, 167, or 333 msec per picture. In one group, subjects were given an immediate test of recognition memory for the pictures and in other groups they searched for a target picture. Even when the target had only been specified by a title (e.g., a boat) detection of a target was strikingly superior to recognition memory. Detection was slightly but significantly better for pictured than named targets. In a third experiment pictures were presented for 50, 70, 90 or 120 msec preceded and followed by a visual mask; at 120 msec recognition memory was as accurate as detection had been. The results, taken together with those in 1969 of Potter and Levy for slower rates of sequential presentation, suggest that on the average a scene is understood and so becomes immune to ordinary visual masking within about 100 msec but requires about 300 msec of further processing before the memory representation is resistant to conceptual masking from a following picture. Possible functions of a short-term conceptual memory, such as the control of eye fixations, are discussed."

Thus the resultant saccadic eye fixations are a very instructive behaviour, revealing much about the underlying cognitive mechanisms that guide them. Of particular interest are the eye fixations used in hand-eye coordination. Such coordination has been extensively studied for single movements from a source location to a target location. In contrast, we have studied multiple fixations where the sources and targets are a function of a task and chosen dynamically by the subject according to task requirements. The task chosen is a copying task: subjects must copy a figure made up of contiguous coloured blocks as fast as possible. The main observation is that although eye fixations are used for the terminal phase of hand movements, they are used for other tasks before and after that phase. The analysis of the spatial and temporal details of these fixations suggests that the underlying decision process that moves the eyes leaves key decisions until just before they are required."

In the present article, the general properties of frame theories are discussed with regard to their implications for psychological processes, and an experiment is presented which tests whether this approach yields viable predictions about the manner in which people comprehend and remember pictures of real-world scenes. Normative ratings were used to construct six target pictures, each of which contained both expected and unexpected objects. Eye movements were then recorded as subjects who anticipated a difficult recognition test viewed the targets for 30 sec each. Then, the subjects were asked to discriminate the target pictures from distractors in which either expected or unexpected objects had been changed. One consequence of the embeddedness of frame systems is that global frames may function as \"semantic pattern detectors,\" so that the perceptual knowledge in them could be used for relatively automatic pattern recognition and comprehension. Thus, subjects might be able to identify expected objects by using automatized encoding procedures that operate on global physical features. In contrast, identification of unexpected objects (i.e., objects not represented in the currently active frame) should generally require more analysis of local visual details. These hypotheses were confirmed with the fixation duration data: First fixations to the unexpected objects were approximately twice as long as first fixations to the expected objects. On the recognition test, subjects generally noticed only the changes that had been made to the unexpected objects, despite the fact that the proportions of correct rejections were made conditional on whether the target objects had been fixated. These data are again consistent with the idea that local visual details of objects represented in the frame are not neccesary for identification and are thus not generally encoded. Further, since subjects usually did not notice when expected objects were deleted or replaced with different expected objects, it was concluded that if two events instantiate the same frame, they may often be indistinguishable, as long as any differences between them are represented as arguments in the frame. Thus, for the most part, the only information about an event that is episodically \"tagged\" is information which distinguishes that particular event from others of the same general class. The data reinforce the utility of a frame theory approach to perception and memory."

Subjects were asked (1) to discriminate texture areas and to distinguish their form (experiments on texture segmentation); (2) to detect salient or vertical line elements (experiments on pop-out); and (3) to identify configurations of similar or dissimilar targets (experiments on grouping). Within the patterns, line orientation was systematically varied to distinguish the effect of differences between areas from the effect of similarity within areas. In all of the experiments, performance was found to depend on local orientation contrast at texture borders rather than on the analysis of line orientation itself. Texture areas were correctly identified only when the orientation contrast at the border well exceeded the overall variation of line orientation in the pattern. Similarly, only target elements with high local orientation contrast were detected fast and \u201cin parallel.\u201d Targets with an orientation contrast lower than background variation required serial search. Preattentive grouping was found to depend on saliency, as defined by local orientation contrast, but not on the similarity of line elements. In addition to local orientation contrast, which played an important role in all of the visual phenomena studied, influences from the alignment of line elements with the outline of a figure were also seen."

Set size was varied and reaction times (RT) were measured. For many unpracticed subjects, the slopes of the resulting RT X Set Size functions are too shallow to be consistent with Treisman's feature integration model, which proposes serial, self-terminating search for conjunctions. Searches for triple conjunctions (Color X Size X Form) are easier than searches for standard conjunctions and can be independent of set size. A guided search model similar to Hoffman's (1979) two-stage model can account for these data. In the model, parallel processes use information about simple features to guide attention in the search for conjunctions. Triple conjunctions are found more efficiently than standard conjunctions because three parallel processes can guide attention more effectively than two."

This result is widely accepted as evidence that a serial self-terminating search is necessary to detect conjunctions. In Experiment 1 of the present study, the subjects searched for a conjunction target (a green T) in displays of 2, 4, or 8 items. Positive and negative display-size slopes were essentially the same in this range. In Experiment 2, the subjects searched for conjunction targets in displays of 2 to 24 items. In displays of 2 to 8 items, the positive and negative slopes were again comparable and the 2:1 ratio was again rejected. In displays of 8 to 24 items, on the other hand, the negative slopes were approximately twice the positive slopes. The same result was obtained in Experiment 3, which was modeled after the conjunction search experiment of Egeth, Virzi, and Garbart (1984). In summary, a 2\\3n1 slope ratio appears to describe the function quite well in the range above 8 items (or if display size is coarsely sampled, as in previous research), but not in the lower range, in which the true ratio is closer to 1\\3n1. These nearly parallel functions in the lower range probably do not, however, reflect a serial exhaustive search: in Experiment 4, positive reaction times were substantially reduced when redundant targets were added to the display. An alternative model of conjunction search is proposed on the basis of these data. This model postulates a molar serial self-terminating search over relatively large clumps of items, and a parallel search within these clumps. It appears, then, that the nature of the attentional limits arising in the process of feature conjunction must be very different from that suggested by Treisman and Gelade."

We all share an interest in such questions as \u201cWhat is \u2018now\u2019?\u2019\u2019 and \u201cWhy is it for each of us always \u2018now\u2019?\u2019\u2019 From the eternal now, we view in memory a past which is our entire stock of information and wisdom. Only now do we attempt in imagination to anticipate the future. Only now may we decide, and now decide we must, for the decision not t o choose among the remaining alternatives is itself one of the alternatives. Only now do we act. Some of you may know that I am credited in the literature with another paper of precisely the same title as this.\u2019 You may wonder why I should confuse matters by thus having two different papers of the same title, delivered ten years apart. The reasons are, I believe, simple and sufficient. Had I not already given the older part of this paper, I should have been forced to give it now, a t least so much of it as would have been possible within the limits of the time available. Happily, the paper does exist and we may simply talk about i t in a more relaxed and enjoyable way. But there is, from my point of view, more to the story. The older part of the paper is incomplete. Henry Quastler, the editor, did a magnificent job of reducing to so slender a volume as Information Theory in Psychology what the participants in the Allerton Park Conference literally lived in five days. On rereading my contribution ten years later, I must admit to a feeling of very real pride a t having my name on it as author. There are no significant changes I would make. What is missing in the paper was missing a t the conference and is present here. There we looked inward as it were, upon a narrow and specific discipline, psychology. Here we look outward a t all things in the universe.that we may in some fashion or another apprehend. Let us review briefly the contents of that ten-year-old paper. Centrally, it concerned an effort to determine the relationships between what was called \u201cpsychological time\u201d and the time of classical Newtonian physical theory and its experimental measurement. Psychological time is the time in which we are aware of things happening, where we are aware of events some of which occur before others, and some of which occur together. For the nature of the various notions of time in physical theories, I refer you to the papers given by the other members of the conference. I t has been known for over a century that there are some nontrivial differences between the time of the given experience of the physicist as a man and the time of his physics, the genetically rather than socially inherited discipline, but i t has not excited anything like the interest roused by the differences among physicists and between varieties of physics on the subject of physical time."
