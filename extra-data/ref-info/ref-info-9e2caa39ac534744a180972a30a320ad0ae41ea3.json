                "text": "fundamental vocabulary (untouchable by the user), and \"specific\" vocabularies. The traditional view of MT as a process of tree structure transformation through pattern matching is complemented by the more recent lexical approach in which the description of grammatical usage is stored in the dictionary as part of the information attached to specific words, and in which more specific rules block the more general ones (cf. Nagao 1987). Dictionary construction is therefore essential to the enterprise, and one may hope that Nagao's plea for a standardized dictionary format and international cooperation in the elaboration of lexicons will be answered by the recent dictionary and text database initiatives that have been launched to meet those needs. As a conclusion, Chapter 8 proposes Nagao's views on the future of MT; these are summarized in the preface by Nagao's Figure 0.1, which predicts a steady improvement in the commercial systems and a sharp rise in the number of MT users during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Nagao also predicts that the improvements due to research in syntax and semantics have basically leveled off, and that further progress will come from research on intersentential components from an AI rather than purely linguistic point of view. For instance, one of the phenomena that MT cannot yet handle is discourse analysis, and both the resolution of intersentential relations and the resolution of referentials without a referent in the text require making inferences about the world. However, Nagao makes the nice point that it is very difficult for an NLP system driven by inferences to deal with new relationships set up in a text, while this is what natural language does all the time (i.e., creates novel sentences that are interpretable). High-level translation capabilities will require long-term basic research both in theoretical linguistics and in cognitive science, going beyond the limits of traditional linguistics on particular languages and toward a theory of translation. As MT is still in its infancy, Nagao advocates a realistic assessment of its possibilities by following the \"engineering practice of limitations based on assumptions about functionality.\" For example, the problem of voice recognition must be solved for interpreting systems, and because of efficiency considerations, the future of interactive systems probably lies in small-quantity private systems. As a final thought-provoking remark: MT is probably more useful between pairs of languages that do not have many mutual speakers, rather than the classic pairs of well-known languages."

The system combines several techniques in order to improve the overall recognition rate. Thinning and shape extraction are performed directly on a graph of the run-length encoding of a binary image. The resulting strokes and other shapes are mapped, using a shape-clustering approach, into binary features which are then fed into a statistical Bayesian classifier. Large-scale trials have shown better than 97 percent top choice correct performance on mixtures of six dissimilar fonts, and over 99 percent on most single fonts, over a range of point sizes. Certain remaining confusion classes are disambiguated through contour analysis, and characters suspected of being merged are broken and reclassified. Finally, layout and linguistic context are applied. The results are illustrated by sample pages."

Thus, for example, it is hard for most parsers to take advantage of the fact that wine is typically drunk, produced, and sold, but (probably) not pruned. So too, it is hard for a parser to know which verbs go with which prepositions (e.g., set up) and which nouns fit together to form compound noun phrases (e.g., computer programmer). This paper will attempt to show that many of these types of concerns can be addressed with syntactic methods (symbol pushing), and need not require explicit semantic interpretation. We have found that it is possible to identify many of these interesting co-occurrence relations by computing simple summary statistics over millions of words of text. This paper will summarize a number of experiments carried out by various subsets of the authors over the last few years. The term collocation will be used quite broadly to include constraints on SVO (subject verb object) triples, phrasal verbs, compound noun phrases, and psycholinguistic notions of word association (e.g., doctorinurse)."
