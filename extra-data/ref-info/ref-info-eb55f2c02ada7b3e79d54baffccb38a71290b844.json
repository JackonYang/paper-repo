Each silhouette is preprocessed to remove noise, smooth edges, and extract the front edge. The processed silhouettes are then represented by a 12-dimensional feature vector, the components of which are obtained by a circular autocorrelation function. Using a weighted k-nearest neighbor decision rule it is shown that a recognition accuracy of 90 percent is attainable in a ten-class problem. An adaptive training procedure is also described which is used for setting up the authority files. This training procedure appears to identify those feature vectors representing a class which are either most important, from an information content point of view, or are observed most often. Finally, a comparison is made between the recognition accuracy obtained using circular autocorrelation features and moment invariant features. It is shown that the former outperforms, in this problem, the latter. The system is also compared to human observers with the result that the system performs no worse than the human observers."

This approach treats face recognition as a two-dimensional recognition problem, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. Face images are projected onto a feature space ('face space') that best encodes the variation among known face images. The face space is defined by the 'eigenfaces', which are the eigenvectors of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to isolated features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The framework provides the ability to learn to recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner.<<ETX>>"

Three classes of experiments are reported: 1) Gathering, analysis, and assessment of face-feature data for 255 faces. 2) Computer identification-studies. 3) Human identification-studies. A set of 22 features was evolved from an initially larger set to provide relevant, distinctive, relatively independent measures which can be judged reliably. Computer studies and a mathematical model established limits of performance of a person attempting to isolate a face from a population using feature descriptions. The model predicts that under certain conditions approximately 6 of an individual's features are required to isolate him from a population of 255. Human experiments under similar conditions showed unique identification occurred with an average of about 7 features. The model predicts that for a population of 4\u00d7106, only 14 feature-descriptions are required. These studies form a foundation for continuing research on real-time man-machine interaction for computer classification and identification of multidimensional vectors specified by noisy components."

                "text": "In this thesis, we consider learning algorithms for neural networks which are based on fitting a mixture probability density to a set of data. \nWe begin with an unsupervised algorithm which is an alternative to the classical winner-take-all competitive algorithms. Rather than updating only the parameters of the \"winner\" on each case, the parameters of all competitors are updated in proportion to their relative responsibility for the case. Use of such a \"soft\" competitive algorithm is shown to give better performance than the more traditional algorithms, with little additional cost. \nWe then consider a supervised modular architecture in which a number of simple \"expert\" networks compete to solve distinct pieces of a large task. A soft competitive mechanism is used to determine how much an expert learns on a case, based on how well the expert performs relative to the other expert networks. At the same time, a separate gating network learns to weight the output of each expert according to a prediction of its relative performance based on the input to the system. Experiments on a number of tasks illustrate that this architecture is capable of uncovering interesting task decompositions and of generalizing better than a single network with small training sets. \nFinally, we consider learning algorithms in which we assume that the actual output of the network should fall into one of a small number of classes or clusters. The objective of learning is to make the variance of these classes as small as possible. In the classical decision-directed algorithm, we decide that an output belongs to the class it is closest to and minimize the squared distance between the output and the center (mean) of this closest class. In the \"soft\" version of this algorithm, we minimize the squared distance between the actual output and a weighted average of the means of all of the classes. The weighting factors are the relative probability that the output belongs to each class. This idea may also be used to model the weights of a network, to produce networks which generalize better from small training sets."

During the last two decades, the method of maximum likelihood has become the most widely followed approach to this problem, thanks primarily to the advent of high speed electronic computers. Here, we first offer a brief survey of the literature directed toward this problem and review maximum-likelihood estimation for it. We then turn to the subject of ultimate interest, which is a particular iterative procedure for numerically approximating maximum-likelihood estimates for mixture density problems. This procedure, known as the EM algorithm, is a specialization to the mixture density context of a general algorithm of the same name used to approximate maximum-likelihood estimates for incomplete data problems.
