This system is based on a region proposal mechanism for detection and deep convolutional neural networks for recognition. Our pipeline uses a novel combination of complementary proposal generation techniques to ensure high recall, and a fast subsequent filtering stage for improving precision. For the recognition and ranking of proposals, we train very large convolutional neural networks to perform word recognition on the whole proposal region at the same time, departing from the character classifier based systems of the past. These networks are trained solely on data produced by a synthetic text generation engine, requiring no human labelled data. Analysing the stages of our pipeline, we show state-of-the-art performance throughout. We perform rigorous experiments across a number of standard end-to-end text spotting benchmarks and text-based image retrieval datasets, showing a large improvement over all previous methods. Finally, we demonstrate a real-world application of our text spotting system to allow thousands of hours of news footage to be instantly searchable via a text query."

This is divided into two sequential tasks: detecting words regions in the image, and recognizing the words within these regions. We make the following contributions: first, we develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier that can be used for both tasks. The CNN has a novel architecture that enables efficient feature sharing (by using a number of layers in common) for text detection, character case-sensitive and insensitive classification, and bigram classification. It exceeds the state-of-the-art performance for all of these. Second, we make a number of technical changes over the traditional CNN architectures, including no downsampling for a per-pixel sliding window, and multi-mode learning with a mixture of linear models (maxout). Third, we have a method of automated data mining of Flickr, that generates word and character level annotations. Finally, these components are used together to form an end-to-end, state-of-the-art text spotting system. We evaluate the text-spotting system on two standard benchmarks, the ICDAR Robust Reading data set and the Street View Text data set, and demonstrate improvements over the state-of-the-art on multiple measures."

However, this low-level pixel operation inherently limits its capability for handling complex text information efficiently (e. g. connections between text or background components), leading to the difficulty in distinguishing texts from background components. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to tackle this problem by leveraging the high capability of convolutional neural network (CNN). In contrast to recent methods using a set of low-level heuristic features, the CNN network is capable of learning high-level features to robustly identify text components from text-like outliers (e.g. bikes, windows, or leaves). Our approach takes advantages of both MSERs and sliding-window based methods. The MSERs operator dramatically reduces the number of windows scanned and enhances detection of the low-quality texts. While the sliding-window with CNN is applied to correctly separate the connections of multiple characters in components. The proposed system achieved strong robustness against a number of extreme text variations and serious real-world problems. It was evaluated on the ICDAR 2011 benchmark dataset, and achieved over 78% in F-measure, which is significantly higher than previous methods."

The real-time performance is achieved by posing the character detection problem as an efficient sequential selection from the set of Extremal Regions (ERs). The ER detector is robust to blur, illumination, color and texture variation and handles low-contrast text. In the first classification stage, the probability of each ER being a character is estimated using novel features calculated with O(1) complexity per region tested. Only ERs with locally maximal probability are selected for the second stage, where the classification is improved using more computationally expensive features. A highly efficient exhaustive search with feedback loops is then applied to group ERs into words and to select the most probable character segmentation. Finally, text is recognized in an OCR stage trained using synthetic fonts. The method was evaluated on two public datasets. On the ICDAR 2011 dataset, the method achieves state-of-the-art text localization results amongst published methods and it is the first one to report results for end-to-end text recognition. On the more challenging Street View Text dataset, the method achieves state-of-the-art recall. The robustness of the proposed method against noise and low contrast of characters is demonstrated by \u201cfalse positives\u201d caused by detected watermark text in the dataset."

Therefore, scene text detection and recognition have become active research topics in computer vision. In this work, we investigate the problem of scene text detection from an alternative perspective and propose a novel algorithm for it. Different from traditional methods, which mainly make use of the properties of single characters or strokes, the proposed algorithm exploits the symmetry property of character groups and allows for direct extraction of text lines from natural images. The experiments on the latest ICDAR benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, compared to conventional approaches, the proposed algorithm shows stronger adaptability to texts in challenging scenarios."

Our framework does not require any human-labelled data, and performs word recognition on the whole image holistically, departing from the character based recognition systems of the past. The deep neural network models at the centre of this framework are trained solely on data produced by a synthetic text generation engine -- synthetic data that is highly realistic and sufficient to replace real data, giving us infinite amounts of training data. This excess of data exposes new possibilities for word recognition models, and here we consider three models, each one \"reading\" words in a different way: via 90k-way dictionary encoding, character sequence encoding, and bag-of-N-grams encoding. In the scenarios of language based and completely unconstrained text recognition we greatly improve upon state-of-the-art performance on standard datasets, using our fast, simple machinery and requiring zero data-acquisition costs."

The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30% relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012 -- achieving a mAP of 53.3%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also present experiments that provide insight into what the network learns, revealing a rich hierarchy of image features. Source code for the complete system is available at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rbg/rcnn."

                "text": "This paper focuses on the problem of word detection and recognition in natural images. The problem is significantly more challenging than reading text in scanned documents, and has only recently gained attention from the computer vision community. Sub-components of the problem, such as text detection and cropped image word recognition, have been studied in isolation [7, 4, 20]. However, what is unclear is how these recent approaches contribute to solving the end-to-end problem of word recognition. We fill this gap by constructing and evaluating two systems. The first, representing the de facto state-of-the-art, is a two stage pipeline consisting of text detection followed by a leading OCR engine. The second is a system rooted in generic object recognition, an extension of our previous work in [20]. We show that the latter approach achieves superior performance. While scene text recognition has generally been treated with highly domain-specific methods, our results demonstrate the suitability of applying generic computer vision methods. Adopting this approach opens the door for real world scene text recognition to benefit from the rapid advances that have been taking place in object recognition."

Contrary to recognition of printed documents, recognizing scene text is a challenging problem. We focus on the problem of recognizing text extracted from natural scene images and the web. Significant attempts have been made to address this problem in the recent past. However, many of these works benefit from the availability of strong context, which naturally limits their applicability. In this work we present a framework that uses a higher order prior computed from an English dictionary to recognize a word, which may or may not be a part of the dictionary. We show experimental results on publicly available datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a large challenging word dataset with five thousand words to evaluate various steps of our method exhaustively. The main contributions of this work are: (1) We present a framework, which incorporates higher order statistical language models to recognize words in an unconstrained manner (i.e. we overcome the need for restricted word lists, and instead use an English dictionary to compute the priors). (2) We achieve significant improvement (more than 20%) in word recognition accuracies without using a restricted word list. (3) We introduce a large word recognition dataset (atleast 5 times larger than other public datasets) with character level annotation and benchmark it."

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision."

The method introduces a novel approach for character detection and recognition which combines the advantages of sliding-window and connected component methods. Characters are detected and recognized as image regions which contain strokes of specific orientations in a specific relative position, where the strokes are efficiently detected by convolving the image gradient field with a set of oriented bar filters. Additionally, a novel character representation efficiently calculated from the values obtained in the stroke detection phase is introduced. The representation is robust to shift at the stroke level, which makes it less sensitive to intra-class variations and the noise induced by normalizing character size and positioning. The effectiveness of the representation is demonstrated by the results achieved in the classification of real-world characters using an euclidian nearest-neighbor classifier trained on synthetic data in a plain form. The method was evaluated on a standard dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art results in both text localization and recognition."

To evaluate the performance of recent algorithms in detecting and recognizing text from complex images, the ICDAR 2011 Robust Reading Competition was organized. Challenge 2 of the competition dealt specifically with detecting/recognizing text in natural scene images. This paper presents an overview of the approaches that the participants used, the evaluation measure, and the dataset used in the Challenge 2 of the contest. We also report the performance of all participating methods for text localization and word recognition tasks and compare their results using standard methods of area precision/recall and edit distance."

Challenge 4 is run on a newly acquired dataset of 1,670 images evaluating Text Localisation, Word Recognition and End-to-End pipelines. In addition, the dataset for Challenge 3 on Video Text has been substantially updated with more video sequences and more accurate ground truth data. Finally, tasks assessing End-to-End system performance have been introduced to all Challenges. The competition took place in the first quarter of 2015, and received a total of 44 submissions. Only the tasks newly introduced in 2015 are reported on. The datasets, the ground truth specification and the evaluation protocols are presented together with the results and a brief summary of the participating methods."

As a result, optical flow data sets are restricted in terms of size, complexity, and diversity, making optical flow algorithms difficult to train and test on realistic data. We introduce a new optical flow data set derived from the open source 3D animated short film Sintel. This data set has important features not present in the popular Middlebury flow evaluation: long sequences, large motions, specular reflections, motion blur, defocus blur, and atmospheric effects. Because the graphics data that generated the movie is open source, we are able to render scenes under conditions of varying complexity to evaluate where existing flow algorithms fail. We evaluate several recent optical flow algorithms and find that current highly-ranked methods on the Middlebury evaluation have difficulty with this more complex data set suggesting further research on optical flow estimation is needed. To validate the use of synthetic data, we compare the image- and flow-statistics of Sintel to those of real films and videos and show that they are similar. The data set, metrics, and evaluation website are publicly available."

Advances like SPPnet and Fast R-CNN have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015 competitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks. Code has been made publicly available"

Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is less likely to predict false positives on background. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, when generalizing from natural images to other domains like artwork."

In this paper, we address an equally hard sub-problem in this domain viz. recognizing arbitrary multi-digit numbers from Street View imagery. Traditional approaches to solve this problem typically separate out the localization, segmentation, and recognition steps. In this paper we propose a unified approach that integrates these three steps via the use of a deep convolutional neural network that operates directly on the image pixels. We employ the DistBelief implementation of deep neural networks in order to train large, distributed neural networks on high quality images. We find that the performance of this approach increases with the depth of the convolutional network, with the best performance occurring in the deepest architecture we trained, with eleven hidden layers. We evaluate this approach on the publicly available SVHN dataset and achieve over $96\\%$ accuracy in recognizing complete street numbers. We show that on a per-digit recognition task, we improve upon the state-of-the-art, achieving $97.84\\%$ accuracy. We also evaluate this approach on an even more challenging dataset generated from Street View imagery containing several tens of millions of street number annotations and achieve over $90\\%$ accuracy. To further explore the applicability of the proposed system to broader text recognition tasks, we apply it to synthetic distorted text from reCAPTCHA. reCAPTCHA is one of the most secure reverse turing tests that uses distorted text to distinguish humans from bots. We report a $99.8\\%$ accuracy on the hardest category of reCAPTCHA. Our evaluations on both tasks indicate that at specific operating thresholds, the performance of the proposed system is comparable to, and in some cases exceeds, that of human operators."

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, improve on the previous best result in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build \u201cfully convolutional\u201d networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional networks achieve improved segmentation of PASCAL VOC (30% relative improvement to 67.2% mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, SIFT Flow, and PASCAL-Context, while inference takes one tenth of a second for a typical image."

At one end of the spectrum, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) applied to scanned pages of well formatted printed text is one of the most successful applications of computer vision to date. At the other extreme lie visual CAPTCHAs - text that is constructed explicitly to fool computer vision algorithms. Both tasks involve recognizing text, yet one is nearly solved while the other remains extremely challenging. In this work, we argue that the appearance of words in the wild spans this range of difficulties and propose a new word recognition approach based on state-of-the-art methods from generic object recognition, in which we consider object categories to be the words themselves. We compare performance of leading OCR engines - one open source and one proprietary - with our new approach on the ICDAR Robust Reading data set and a new word spotting data set we introduce in this paper: the Street View Text data set. We show improvements of up to 16% on the data sets, demonstrating the feasibility of a new approach to a seemingly old problem."

In object detection, methods such as R-CNN have obtained excellent results by integrating CNNs with region proposal generation algorithms such as selective search. In this paper, we investigate the role of proposal generation in CNN-based detectors in order to determine whether it is a necessary modelling component, carrying essential geometric information not contained in the CNN, or whether it is merely a way of accelerating detection. We do so by designing and evaluating a detector that uses a trivial region generation scheme, constant for each image. Combined with SPP, this results in an excellent and fast detector that does not require to process an image with algorithms other than the CNN itself. We also streamline and simplify the training of CNN-based detectors by integrating several learning steps in a single algorithm, as well as by proposing a number of improvements that accelerate detection."

It is a challenging task as no reliable depth cues are available, e.g., stereo correspondences, motions etc. Previous efforts have been focusing on exploiting geometric priors or additional sources of information, with all using hand-crafted features. Recently, there is mounting evidence that features from deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) are setting new records for various vision applications. On the other hand, considering the continuous characteristic of the depth values, depth estimations can be naturally formulated into a continuous conditional random field (CRF) learning problem. Therefore, we in this paper present a deep convolutional neural field model for estimating depths from a single image, aiming to jointly explore the capacity of deep CNN and continuous CRF. Specifically, we propose a deep structured learning scheme which learns the unary and pairwise potentials of continuous CRF in a unified deep CNN framework. The proposed method can be used for depth estimations of general scenes with no geometric priors nor any extra information injected. In our case, the integral of the partition function can be analytically calculated, thus we can exactly solve the log-likelihood optimization. Moreover, solving the MAP problem for predicting depths of a new image is highly efficient as closed-form solutions exist.

We review current 3D datasets and find them lacking in variation of scenes, categories, instances, and viewpoints. Here we present our dataset of color and depth image pairs, gathered in real domestic and office environments. It currently includes over 50 classes, with more images added continuously by a crowd-sourced collection effort. We establish baseline performance in a PASCAL VOC-style detection task, and suggest two ways that inferred world size of the object may be used to improve detection. The dataset and annotations can be downloaded at http://www.kinectdata.com."

Optical flow estimation has not been among the tasks CNNs succeeded at. In this paper we construct CNNs which are capable of solving the optical flow estimation problem as a supervised learning task. We propose and compare two architectures: a generic architecture and another one including a layer that correlates feature vectors at different image locations. Since existing ground truth data sets are not sufficiently large to train a CNN, we generate a large synthetic Flying Chairs dataset. We show that networks trained on this unrealistic data still generalize very well to existing datasets such as Sintel and KITTI, achieving competitive accuracy at frame rates of 5 to 10 fps."

Most existing work ignores physical interactions or is applied only to tidy rooms and hallways. Our goal is to parse typical, often messy, indoor scenes into floor, walls, supporting surfaces, and object regions, and to recover support relationships. One of our main interests is to better understand how 3D cues can best inform a structured 3D interpretation. We also contribute a novel integer programming formulation to infer physical support relations. We offer a new dataset of 1449 RGBD images, capturing 464 diverse indoor scenes, with detailed annotations. Our experiments demonstrate our ability to infer support relations in complex scenes and verify that our 3D scene cues and inferred support lead to better object segmentation."

Following a common consensus in the field, we do not assume that a figure- ground segmentation is available prior to recognition. However, in contrast to most standard approaches for object class recognition, our approach automati- cally segments the object as a result of the categorization. This combination of recognition and segmentation into one process is made pos- sible by our use of an Implicit Shape Model, which integrates both into a common probabilistic framework. In addition to the recognition and segmentation result, it also generates a per-pixel confidence measure specifying the area that supports a hypothesis and how much it can be trusted. We use this confidence to derive a nat- ural extension of the approach to handle multiple objects in a scene and resolve ambiguities between overlapping hypotheses with a novel MDL-based criterion. In addition, we present an extensive evaluation of our method on a standard dataset for car detection and compare its performance to existing methods from the literature. Our results show that the proposed method significantly outper- forms previously published methods while needing one order of magnitude less training examples. Finally, we present results for articulated objects, which show that the proposed method can categorize and segment unfamiliar objects in differ- ent articulations and with widely varying texture patterns, even under significant partial occlusion."

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry."

The model is made up of several texture-mapped planar billboards and has the complexity of a typical children's pop-up book illustration. Our main insight is that instead of attempting to recover precise geometry, we statistically model geometric classes defined by their orientations in the scene. Our algorithm labels regions of the input image into coarse categories: \"ground\", \"sky\", and \"vertical\". These labels are then used to \"cut and fold\" the image into a pop-up model using a set of simple assumptions. Because of the inherent ambiguity of the problem and the statistical nature of the approach, the algorithm is not expected to work on every image. However. it performs surprisingly well for a wide range of scenes taken from a typical person's photo album."

For shallow representations our approach provides significantly better reconstructions than existing methods, revealing that there is surprisingly rich information contained in these features. Inverting a deep network trained on ImageNet provides several insights into the properties of the feature representation learned by the network. Most strikingly, the colors and the rough contours of an image can be reconstructed from activations in higher network layers and even from the predicted class probabilities."

This fundamental insight allows us to design object detection algorithms that are as accurate, and considerably faster, than the state-of-the-art. The computational bottleneck of many modern detectors is the computation of features at every scale of a finely-sampled image pyramid. Our key insight is that one may compute finely sampled feature pyramids at a fraction of the cost, without sacrificing performance: for a broad family of features we find that features computed at octave-spaced scale intervals are sufficient to approximate features on a finely-sampled pyramid. Extrapolation is inexpensive as compared to direct feature computation. As a result, our approximation yields considerable speedups with negligible loss in detection accuracy. We modify three diverse visual recognition systems to use fast feature pyramids and show results on both pedestrian detection (measured on the Caltech, INRIA, TUD-Brussels and ETH data sets) and general object detection (measured on the PASCAL VOC). The approach is general and is widely applicable to vision algorithms requiring fine-grained multi-scale analysis. Our approximation is valid for images with broad spectra (most natural images) and fails for images with narrow band-pass spectra (e.g., periodic textures)."

In this work, we propose new solutions to the character and word recognition problems and then show how to combine these solutions in an end-to-end text-recognition system. We do so by leveraging the recently introduced Maxout networks along with hybrid HMM models that have proven useful for voice recognition. Using these elements, we build a tunable and highly accurate recognition system that beats state-of-the-art results on all the sub-problems for both the ICDAR 2003 and SVT benchmark datasets."

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

We demonstrate in a user study that synthetic images produced by our method are confusable with real scenes, even for people who believe they are good at telling the difference. Further, our study shows that our method is competitive with other insertion methods while requiring less scene information. We also collected new illumination and reflectance datasets; renderings produced by our system compare well to ground truth. Our system has applications in the movie and gaming industry, as well as home decorating and user content creation, among others."

Geometric classes describe the 3D orientation of an image region with respect to the camera. We provide a multiple-hypothesis framework for robustly estimating scene structure from a single image and obtaining confidences for each geometric label. These confidences can then be used to improve the performance of many other applications. We provide a thorough quantitative evaluation of our algorithm on a set of outdoor images and demonstrate its usefulness in two applications: object detection and automatic single-view reconstruction."

How can vision be so rich, but at the same time robust and fast? The analysis-by-synthesis approach to vision offers an account of the richness of our percepts, but it is typically considered too fragile to apply robustly to real scenes, and too slow to explain perception in the brain. Here we propose a version of analysisby-synthesis in the spirit of the Helmholtz machine (Dayan, Hinton, Neal, & Zemel, 1995) that can be implemented efficiently and robustly, by combining a generative model based on a realistic 3D computer graphics engine with a recognition model based on a deep convolutional network fine-tuned by brief runs of MCMC inference. We test this approach in the domain of face recognition and show that it meets several challenging desiderata: it can reconstruct the approximate shape and texture of a novel face from a single view, at a level indistinguishable to humans; it accounts quantitatively for human behavior in \u201chard\u201d recognition tasks that foil conventional machine systems; and it qualitatively matches neural responses in a network of face-selective brain areas. Comparison to other models provides insights to the success of our model."

We propose a novel method for generating object bounding box proposals using edges. Edges provide a sparse yet informative representation of an image. Our main observation is that the number of contours that are wholly contained in a bounding box is indicative of the likelihood of the box containing an object. We propose a simple box objectness score that measures the number of edges that exist in the box minus those that are members of contours that overlap the box\u2019s boundary. Using efficient data structures, millions of candidate boxes can be evaluated in a fraction of a second, returning a ranked set of a few thousand top-scoring proposals. Using standard metrics, we show results that are significantly more accurate than the current state-of-the-art while being faster to compute. In particular, given just 1000 proposals we achieve over 96% object recall at overlap threshold of 0.5 and over 75% recall at the more challenging overlap of 0.7. Our approach runs in 0.25 seconds and we additionally demonstrate a near real-time variant with only minor loss in accuracy."

The commonly used precision and recall measures are computed from the overlap area of these two rectangles. However, these measures have several drawbacks: they don't give intuitive information about the proportion of the correctly detected objects and the number of false alarms, and they cannot be accumulated across multiple images without creating ambiguity in their interpretation. Furthermore, quantitative and qualitative evaluation is often mixed resulting in ambiguous measures.In this paper we propose a new approach which tackles these problems. The performance of a detection algorithm is illustrated intuitively by performance graphs which present object level precision and recall depending on constraints on detection quality. In order to compare different detection algorithms, a representative single performance value is computed from the graphs. The influence of the test database on the detection performance is illustrated by performance/generality graphs. The evaluation method can be applied to different types of object detection algorithms. It has been tested on different text detection algorithms, among which are the participants of the ICDAR 2003 text detection competition."

Our contour detector combines multiple local cues into a globalization framework based on spectral clustering. Our segmentation algorithm consists of generic machinery for transforming the output of any contour detector into a hierarchical region tree. In this manner, we reduce the problem of image segmentation to that of contour detection. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that both our contour detection and segmentation methods significantly outperform competing algorithms. The automatically generated hierarchical segmentations can be interactively refined by user-specified annotations. Computation at multiple image resolutions provides a means of coupling our system to recognition applications."

RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing"

Finally, we propose a grouping strategy that combines our multiscale regions into highly-accurate object candidates by exploring efficiently their combinatorial space.

This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters."

This minimal information is typically the vanishing line of a reference plane, and a vanishing point for a direction not parallel to the plane. It is shown that affine scene structure may then be determined from the image, without knowledge of the camera's internal calibration (e.g. focal length), nor of the explicit relation between camera and world (pose).In particular, we show how to (i) compute the distance between planes parallel to the reference plane (up to a common scale factor); (ii) compute area and length ratios on any plane parallel to the reference plane; (iii) determine the camera's location. Simple geometric derivations are given for these results. We also develop an algebraic representation which unifies the three types of measurement and, amongst other advantages, permits a first order error propagation analysis to be performed, associating an uncertainty with each measurement.We demonstrate the technique for a variety of applications, including height measurements in forensic images and 3D graphical modelling from single images."
