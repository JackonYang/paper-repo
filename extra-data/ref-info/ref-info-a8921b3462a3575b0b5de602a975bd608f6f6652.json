We explain the principles behind the belief propagation (BP) algorithm, which is an efficient way to solve inference problems based on passing local messages. We develop a unified approach, with examples, notation, and graphical models borrowed from the relevant disciplines.We explain the close connection between the BP algorithm and the Bethe approximation of statistical physics. In particular, we show that BP can only converge to a fixed point that is also a stationary point of the Bethe approximation to the free energy. This result helps explaining the successes of the BP algorithm and enables connections to be made with variational approaches to approximate inference.The connection of BP with the Bethe approximation also suggests a way to construct new message-passing algorithms based on improvements to Bethe's approximation introduced Kikuchi and others. The new generalized belief propagation (GBP) algorithms are significantly more accurate than ordinary BP for some problems. We illustrate how to construct GBP algorithms with a detailed example."

However, there has been little understanding of the algorithm or the nature of the solutions it finds for general graphs. \n \nWe show that BP can only converge to a stationary point of an approximate free energy, known as the Bethe free energy in statistical physics. This result characterizes BP fixed-points and makes connections with variational approaches to approximate inference. \n \nMore importantly, our analysis lets us build on the progress made in statistical physics since Bethe's approximation was introduced in 1935. Kikuchi and others have shown how to construct more accurate free energy approximations, of which Bethe's approximation is the simplest. Exploiting the insights from our analysis, we derive generalized belief propagation (GBP) versions of these Kikuchi approximations. These new message passing algorithms can be significantly more accurate than ordinary BP, at an adjustable increase in complexity. We illustrate such a new GBP algorithm on a grid Markov network and show that it gives much more accurate marginal probabilities than those found using ordinary BP."

Specifically, the fixed points of the belief propagation algorithm are shown to coincide with the stationary points of the Bethe\u2019s approximate free energy subject to consistency constraints. Bethe\u2019s approximation is known as a special case of a general class of approximations called Kikuchi free energy approximations. A general class of belief propagation algorithms was also introduced in [1], which attempts to find the stationary points of a general Kikuchi free energy functional. In this paper we first examine the physical significance of the \u2018free energy\u2019 functions, and review the general Kikuchi approximations using M\u00f6bius inversion formula. Next we define a general constrained minimization problem corresponding to the general Kikuchi approximation whose stationary points approximate marginals of a product function, and we specify a general class of local message passing algorithms along the edges of the Hasse diagram of the collection of Kikuchi regions, which attempt to solve that problem. We further give sufficient conditions under which a Kikuchi functional has a unique minimum, and/or closely approximates the exact free energy. These directly translate to conditions for the convergence and correctness of the belief propagation algorithm. I. Free Energy and Kikuchi Approximation Consider a system with N distinct and fixed sites. Attached to each site i is an elementary magnet which can take a spin value si from the set A of possible spins. Denote by s = (s1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , sN ) the configuration of the system. Then, under fundamental assumptions of thermal physics, it can be shown that if the system is in thermal equilibrium with a large reservoir, the probability that the system will be in a configuration s is given by the Boltzmann distribution:"

In this paper, we will recast the YFW results in the context of the \u201cgeneralized distributive law\u201d [1] formulation of belief propagation. Our main result is that if the GDL is applied to junction graph, the fixed points of the algorithm are in one-to-one correspondence with the stationary points of a certain Bethe-Kikuchi free energy. If the junction graph has no cycles, the BK free energy is convex and has a unique stationary point, which is a global minimum. On the other hand, if the junction graph has cycles, the main result at least shows that the GDL is trying to do something sensible."

Unlike loopy belief propagation, which iterates fixed point equations, we directly descend on the Bethe free energy. The algorithm consists of two phases, first we update the pairwise probabilities, given the marginal probabilities at each unit, using an analytic expression. Next, we update the marginal probabilities, by following the negative gradient of the Bethe free energy. Both steps are guaranteed to decrease the Bethe free energy, and since it is lower bounded, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum. We also show that the Bethe free energy is equal to the TAP free energy up to second order in the weights. In experiments we confirm that when belief propagation converges it usually finds identical solutions as our belief optimization method. The stable nature of belief optimization makes it ideally suited for learning graphical models from data."

However, the choice of a good set of clusters to be used in GBP has remained more of an art then a science until this day. This paper proposes a sequential approach to adding new clusters of nodes and their interactions (i.e. \"regions\") to the approximation. We first review and analyze the recently introduced region graphs and find that three kinds of operations (\"split\", \"merge\" and \"death\") leave the free energy and (under some conditions) the fixed points of GBP invariant. This leads to the notion of \"weakly irreducible\" regions as the natural candidates to be added to the approximation. Computational complexity of the GBP algorithm is controlled by restricting attention to regions with small \"region-width\". Combining the above with an efficient (i.e. local in the graph) measure to predict the improved accuracy of GBP leads to the sequential \"region pursuit\" algorithm for adding new regions bottom-up to the region graph. Experiments show that this algorithm can indeed perform close to optimally."

                "text": "One of the major obstacles to using Bayesian methods for pattern recognition has been its computational expense. This thesis presents an approximation technique that can perform Bayesian inference faster and more accurately than previously possible. This method, \u201cExpectation Propagation,\u201d unifies and generalizes two previous techniques: assumed-density filtering, an extension of the Kalman filter, and loopy belief propagation, an extension of belief propagation in Bayesian networks. The unification shows how both of these algorithms can be viewed as approximating the true posterior distribution with simpler distribution, which is close in the sense of KL-divergence. Expectation Propagation exploits the best of both algorithms: the generality of assumed-density filtering and the accuracy of loopy belief propagation. \nLoopy belief propagation, because it propagates exact belief states, is useful for limited types of belief networks, such as purely discrete networks. Expectation Propagation approximates the belief states with expectations, such as means and variances, giving it much wider scope. Expectation Propagation also extends belief propagation in the opposite direction\u2014propagating richer belief states which incorporate correlations between variables. \nThis framework is demonstrated in a variety of statistical models using synthetic and real-world data. On Gaussian mixture problems, Expectation Propagation is found, for the same amount of computation, to be convincingly better than rival approximation techniques: Monte Carlo, Laplace's method, and variational Bayes. For pattern recognition, Expectation Propagation provides an algorithm for training Bayes Point Machine classifiers that is faster and more accurate than any previously known. The resulting classifiers outperform Support Vector Machines on several standard datasets, in addition to having a comparable training time. Expectation Propagation can also be used to choose an appropriate feature set for classification, via Bayesian model selection.

Our work builds on recent results by Yedidia, Freeman, and Weiss (2000), who showed that the fixed points of BP and GBP algorithms correspond to extrema of the Bethe and Kikuchi free energies, respectively. We obtain two algorithms by applying CCCP to the Bethe and Kikuchi free energies, respectively (CCCP is a procedure, introduced here, for obtaining discrete iterative algorithms by decomposing a cost function into a concave and a convex part). We implement our CCCP algorithms on two- and three-dimensional spin glasses and compare their results to BP and GBP. Our simulations show that the CCCP algorithms are stable and converge very quickly (the speed of CCCP is similar to that of BP and GBP). Unlike CCCP, BP will often not converge for these problems (GBP usually, but not always, converges). The results found by CCCP applied to the Bethe or Kikuchi free energies are equivalent, or slightly better than, those found by BP or GBP, respectively (when BP and GBP converge). Note that for these, and other problems, BP and GBP give very accurate results (see Yedidia et al., 2000), and failure to converge is their major error mode. Finally, we point out that our algorithms have a large range of inference and learning applications."

The most dramatic instance of this is the near Shannon-limit performance of \"Turbo Codes\" -- codes whose decoding algorithm is equivalent to loopy belief propagation in a chain-structured Bayesian network. \n \nIn this paper we ask: is there something special about the error-correcting code context, or does loopy propagation work as an approximate inference scheme in a more general setting? We compare the marginals computed using loopy propagation to the exact ones in four Bayesian network architectures, including two real-world networks: ALARM and QMR. We find that the loopy beliefs often converge and when they do, they give a good approximation to the correct marginals. However, on the QMR network, the loopy beliefs oscillated and had no obvious relationship to the correct posteriors. We present some initial investigations into the cause of these oscillations, and show that some simple methods of preventing them lead to the wrong results."

Such a factorization can be visualized with a bipartite graph that we call a factor graph, In this tutorial paper, we present a generic message-passing algorithm, the sum-product algorithm, that operates in a factor graph. Following a single, simple computational rule, the sum-product algorithm computes-either exactly or approximately-various marginal functions derived from the global function. A wide variety of algorithms developed in artificial intelligence, signal processing, and digital communications can be derived as specific instances of the sum-product algorithm, including the forward/backward algorithm, the Viterbi algorithm, the iterative \"turbo\" decoding algorithm, Pearl's (1988) belief propagation algorithm for Bayesian networks, the Kalman filter, and certain fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms."

The Kikuchi approximation method defines a certain constrained optimization problem, called the Kikuchi problem, and treats its stationary points as approximations to the desired marginals. We show how to associate a graph to any Kikuchi problem and describe a class of local message-passing algorithms along the edges of any such graph, which attempt to find the solutions to the problem. Implementation of these algorithms on graphs with fewer edges requires fewer operations in each iteration. We therefore characterize minimal graphs for a Kikuchi problem, which are those with the minimum number of edges. We show with empirical results that these simpler algorithms often offer significant savings in computational complexity, without suffering a loss in the convergence rate. We give conditions for the convexity of a given Kikuchi problem and the exactness of the approximations in terms of the loops of the minimal graph. More precisely, we show that if the minimal graph is cycle free, then the Kikuchi approximation method is exact, and the converse is also true generically. Together with the fact that in the cycle-free case, the iterative algorithms are equivalent to the well-known belief propagation algorithm, our results imply that, generically, the Kikuchi approximation method can be exact if and only if traditional junction tree methods could also solve the problem exactly."

For a given value of N the problem is known to be most difficult when \u03b1 = M/N is close to the experimental threshold \u03b1c separating the region where almost all formulas are SAT from the region where all formulas are UNSAT. Recent results from a statistical physics analysis suggest that the difficulty is related to the existence of a clustering phenomenon of the solutions when \u03b1 is close to (but smaller than) \u03b1c. We introduce a new type of message passing algorithm which allows to find efficiently a satisfying assignment of the variables in this difficult region. This algorithm is iterative and composed of two main parts. The first is a message\u2010passing procedure which generalizes the usual methods like Sum\u2010Product or Belief Propagation: It passes messages that may be thought of as surveys over clusters of the ordinary messages. The second part uses the detailed probabilistic information obtained from the surveys in order to fix variables and simplify the problem. Eventually, the simplified problem that remains is solved by a conventional heuristic. \u00a9 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct. Alg., 2005"

This method, \"Expectation Propagation,\" unifies two previous techniques: assumed-density filtering, an extension of the Kalman filter, and loopy belief propagation, an extension of belief propagation in Bayesian networks. Loopy belief propagation, because it propagates exact belief states, is useful for a limited class of belief networks, such as those which are purely discrete. Expectation Propagation approximates the belief states by only retaining expectations, such as mean and varitmce, and iterates until these expectations are consistent throughout the network. This makes it applicable to hybrid networks with discrete and continuous nodes. Experiments with Gaussian mixture models show Expectation Propagation to be donvincingly better than methods with similar computational cost: Laplace's method, variational Bayes, and Monte Carlo. Expectation Propagation also provides an efficient algorithm for training Bayes point machine classifiers."

When the graph is singly connected, local propagation rules of the sort proposed by Pearl (1988) are guaranteed to converge to the correct posterior probabilities. Recently a number of researchers have empirically demonstrated good performance of these same local propagation schemes on graphs with loops, but a theoretical understanding of this performance has yet to be achieved. For graphical models with a single loop, we derive an analytical relationship between the probabilities computed using local propagation and the correct marginals. Using this relationship we show a category of graphical models with loops for which local propagation gives rise to provably optimal maximum a posteriori assignments (although the computed marginals will be incorrect). We also show how nodes can use local information in the messages they receive in order to correct their computed marginals. We discuss how these results can be extended to graphical models with multiple loops and show simulation results suggesting that some properties of propagation on single-loop graphs may hold for a larger class of graphs. Specifically we discuss the implication of our results for understanding a class of recently proposed error-correcting codes known as turbo codes."

As a tractable structure, tree approximations have been utilized in the variational method of Ghahramani & Jordan (1997) and the sequential projection method of Frey et al. (2000). However, belief propagation represents each factor of the graph with a product of single-node messages. In this paper, belief propagation is extended to represent factors with tree approximations, by way of the expectation propagation framework. That is, each factor sends a \"message\" to all pairs of nodes in a tree structure. The result is more accurate inferences and more frequent convergence than ordinary belief propagation, at a lower cost than variational trees or double-loop algorithms."

This quantity plays an important role in various contexts, including approximating marginal distributions, parameter estimation, combinatorial enumeration, statistical decision theory, and large-deviations bounds. Our derivation is based on concepts from convex duality and information geometry: in particular, it exploits mixtures of distributions in the exponential domain, and the Legendre mapping between exponential and mean parameters. In the special case of convex combinations of tree-structured distributions, we obtain a family of variational problems, similar to the Bethe variational problem, but distinguished by the following desirable properties: i) they are convex, and have a unique global optimum; and ii) the optimum gives an upper bound on the log partition function. This optimum is defined by stationary conditions very similar to those defining fixed points of the sum-product algorithm, or more generally, any local optimum of the Bethe variational problem. As with sum-product fixed points, the elements of the optimizing argument can be used as approximations to the marginals of the original model. The analysis extends naturally to convex combinations of hypertree-structured distributions, thereby establishing links to Kikuchi approximations and variants."

(1993) and an algorithm that has been well known in the artificial intelligence community for a decade, but which is relatively unknown to information theorists: Pearl's (1982) belief propagation algorithm. We see that if Pearl's algorithm is applied to the \"belief network\" of a parallel concatenation of two or more codes, the turbo decoding algorithm immediately results. Unfortunately, however, this belief diagram has loops, and Pearl only proved that his algorithm works when there are no loops, so an explanation of the experimental performance of turbo decoding is still lacking. However, we also show that Pearl's algorithm can be used to routinely derive previously known iterative, but suboptimal, decoding algorithms for a number of other error-control systems, including Gallager's (1962) low-density parity-check codes, serially concatenated codes, and product codes. Thus, belief propagation provides a very attractive general methodology for devising low-complexity iterative decoding algorithms for hybrid coded systems."

We present a number of examples of graphical models, including the QMR-DT database, the sigmoid belief network, the Boltzmann machine, and several variants of hidden Markov models, in which it is infeasible to run exact inference algorithms. We then introduce variational methods, which exploit laws of large numbers to transform the original graphical model into a simplified graphical model in which inference is efficient. Inference in the simpified model provides bounds on probabilities of interest in the original model. We describe a general framework for generating variational transformations based on convex duality. Finally we return to the examples and demonstrate how variational algorithms can be formulated in each case."

This class includes the belief propagation (BP) or sum-product algorithm as well as variations and extensions of BP. Algorithms in this class can be formulated as a sequence of reparameterization updates, each of which entails refactorizing a portion of the distribution corresponding to an acyclic subgraph (i.e., a tree, or more generally, a hypertree). The ultimate goal is to obtain an alternative but equivalent factorization using functions that represent (exact or approximate) marginal distributions on cliques of the graph. Our framework highlights an important property of the sum-product algorithm and the larger class of reparameterization algorithms: the original distribution on the graph with cycles is not changed. The perspective of tree-based updates gives rise to a simple and intuitive characterization of the fixed points in terms of tree consistency. We develop interpretations of these results in terms of information geometry. The invariance of the distribution, in conjunction with the fixed-point characterization, enables us to derive an exact expression for the difference between the true marginals on an arbitrary graph with cycles, and the approximations provided by belief propagation. More broadly, our analysis applies to any algorithm that minimizes the Bethe free energy. We also develop bounds on the approximation error, which illuminate the conditions that govern their accuracy. Finally, we show how the reparameterization perspective extends naturally to generalizations of BP (e.g., Kikuchi (1951) approximations and variants) via the notion of hypertree reparameterization."

Constrained minimization of the Bethe free energy can be turned into an unconstrained saddle-point problem. Both converging double-loop algorithms and standard loopy belief propagation can be interpreted as attempts to solve this saddle-point problem. Stability analysis then leads us to conclude that stable fixed points of loopy belief propagation must be (local) minima of the Bethe free energy. Perhaps surprisingly, the converse need not be the case: minima can be unstable fixed points. We illustrate this with an example and discuss implications."

But the new volume is much more than a revision, in that it is explicitly based on quantum mechanics from the outset ; the first dynamical equation found written in the formal presentation is a wave-equation. Prof. Fowler states in justification that although classical mechanics is used to derive the quantum mechanics by a process of generalization, \"once the laws of quantum mechanics have been thus guessed, as they must be before we can discuss the theorems of statistical mechanics, quantized systems naturally come first. In 1935 this attitude hardly needs apology\". In consequence of this, the concluding chapter of the first edition, dealing with quantum statistics, has been incorporated in the new exposition from the start, and what is effectively the opening chapter is now doubled in length. Otherwise there is no change of general structure. But a comparison of the two editions shows that the chapter of the first edition entitled \"Thermionics\" is now more than four times as long, and contains a treatment of the electron theory of metals and of semi-conductors ; that the chapter on dielectrics and magnetic constants has been similarly extended, and now includes an account of ferro-magnetism ; lastly, there is a new concluding chapter on \"co-operative\" and other phenomena. The number of references is almost doubled. It is difficult to over-estimate the amount of work involved in thus re-writing and extending what was already an encyclop\u00e6dic work.Statistical Mechanics: \n the Theory of the Properties of Matter in Equilibrium.

Using the cavity method at zero temperature, we find the phase diagram for the K=3 case. We show the existence of an intermediate phase in the satisfiable region, where the proliferation of metastable states is at the origin of the slowdown of search algorithms. The fundamental order parameter introduced in the cavity method, which consists of surveys of local magnetic fields in the various possible states of the system, can be computed for one given sample. These surveys can be used to invent new types of algorithms for solving hard combinatorial optimizations problems. One such algorithm is shown here for the K=3 satisfiability problem, with very good performances."

This approximation is found to agree with the rigorous expansion of the partition function up to the fourth moment by Kirkwood's moment method, so far as the disordered state is concerned. In Sec.

(see European Transactions on Telelecommunications, vol.6, p.513-25, Sept./Oct. 1995) proposed graphical code realizations using three kinds of elements: symbol variables, state variables and local constraints. We focus on normal realizations, namely Wiberg-type realizations in which all symbol variables have degree 1 and state variables have degree 2. A natural graphical model of a normal realization represents states by leaf edges, states by ordinary edges, and local constraints by vertices. Any such graph may be decoded by message-passing (the sum-product algorithm). We show that any Wiberg-type realization may be put into normal form without essential change in its graph or its decoding complexity. Group or linear codes are realized by group or linear realizations. We show that an appropriately defined dual of a group or linear normal realization realizes the dual group or linear code. The symbol variables, state variables and graph topology of the dual realization are unchanged, while local constraints are replaced by their duals."

At high temperatures, the atoms are distributed practically at random among the lattice points of the crystal, but at low temperatures a superlattice may be formed such that the atoms of one kind are arranged in a regular lattice of their own and the atoms of the other kind occupy the remaining \u201csites\u201d in the crystal. The transition from the ordered to the disordered state occurs in a fairly small temperature range, and is accompanied by a large specific heat, an increase in electric resistance, etc. The mathematical method employed by Bragg and Williams is similar to that used in Weiss\u2019s theory of ferromagnetism . Both involve the assumption that the \u201cforce\u201d tending to produce order at a given point is uniquely determined by the average state of order throughout the crystal. Actually it will depend on the configuration of the atoms in the immediate neighbourhood of the point under consideration. The order of the crystal as a whole determines this configuration only on the average. In the present paper, the effect of fluctuations in configuration, which was neglected by Bragg and Williams, will be taken into account."

The uniform, staggered, and spin glass susceptibilities chi u, chi s and chi g are calculated explicitly for the random bond Ising models on d-dimensional (d=2, 3, 4 and 6) cubic lattices, in the case of the binary mixture of equal strength JA=-JB, by the square approximation developed by Katsura and Fujiki (1980). This approximation includes directly the closed-loop and frustration effects, and the authors obtain the ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and spin glass transition temperatures Tc, TN and Tg. The values of both Tc and Tg are lower than those in the Bethe approximation. In dimensions d>or=4, slight decreases in Tg are obtained. The decreases in Tg are not small for d=2 and 3, but no drastic changes are observed. The spin glass states seem to be realised for d>or=2 at least as metastable states."

The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty\u0097and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition\u0097in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability."

Graphical models provide a general methodology for approaching these problems, and indeed many of the models developed by researchers in these applied fields are instances of the general graphical model formalism. We review some of the basic ideas underlying graphical models, including the algorithmic ideas that allow graphical models to be deployed in large-scale data analysis problems. We also present examples of graphical models in bioinformatics, error-control coding and language processing."

The typical minimum distance of these codes increases linearly with block length for a fixed rate and fixed j . When used with maximum likelihood decoding on a sufficiently quiet binary-input symmetric channel, the typical probability of decoding error decreases exponentially with block length for a fixed rate and fixed j . A simple but nonoptimum decoding scheme operating directly from the channel a posteriori probabilities is described. Both the equipment complexity and the data-handling capacity in bits per second of this decoder increase approximately linearly with block length. For j > 3 and a sufficiently low rate, the probability of error using this decoder on a binary symmetric channel is shown to decrease at least exponentially with a root of the block length.

After their introduction, these algorithms have been studied by mathematical tools pertinent more to computer science than the conventional algebraic coding theory. We give an algebraic description of the optimal and suboptimal bit decoders and of the optimal and suboptimal message passing. We explain exactly how suboptimal algorithms approximate the optimal, and show how good these approximations are in some special cases."
