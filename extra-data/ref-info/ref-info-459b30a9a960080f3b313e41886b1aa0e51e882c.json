A texture model is a mathematical procedure capable of producing and describing a textured image. We explore the use of Markov random fields as texture models. The binomial model, where each point in the texture has a binomial distribution with parameter controlled by its neighbors and ``number of tries'' equal to the number of gray levels, was taken to be the basic model for the analysis. A method of generating samples from the binomial model is given, followed by a theoretical and practical analysis of the method's convergence. Examples show how the parameters of the Markov random field control the strength and direction of the clustering in the image. The power of the binomial model to produce blurry, sharp, line-like, and blob-like textures is demonstrated. Natural texture samples were digitized and their parameters were estimated under the Markov random field model. A hypothesis test was used for an objective assessment of goodness-of-fit under the Markov random field model. Overall, microtextures fit the model well. The estimated parameters of the natural textures were used as input to the generation procedure. The synthetic microtextures closely resembled their real counterparts, while the regular and inhomogeneous textures did not."

Using a communication-theory model for the process of image formation, we find that the most likely object has a maximum entropy and is represented by a restoring formula that is positive and not band limited. The derivation is an adaptation to optics of a formulation by Jaynes for unbiased estimates of positive probability functions. The restoring formula is tested, via computer simulation, upon noisy images of objects consisting of random impulses. These are found to be well restored, with resolution often exceeding the Rayleigh limit and with a complete absence of spurious detail. The proviso is that the noise in each image input must not exceed about 40% of the signal image. The restoring method is applied to experimental data consisting of line spectra. Results are consistent with those of the computer simulations."

First, a dynamic model is developed with a response characteristic which matches that of the scanner output (the input of the estimator is the output of a horizontal line scanner) in a statistical sense. Such models have the form of an ordinary differential or difference equation with white noise input. An insignificant approximation is introduced by using a constant-coefficient model. The appropriate model is a vector valued difference equation with the solution representing a vector Markov process. The next step is to obtain the minimum mean square estimate of the image by using a Kalman filter. Since the image estimation is an interpolation problem, two successive runs over the observation are performed in opposite directions and the resultant estimates are averaged. Examples are included for illustration."

Each of these models is characterized by a set of neighbors, a set of coefficients, and a noise sequence of specified characteristics. We are concerned with two problems: the estimation of the unknown parameters in both SAR and CM models and the choice of an appropriate model from a class of such competing models. Assuming Gaussian-distributed variables, we discuss maximum likelihood (ML) estimation methods. In general, the ML scheme leads to nonlinear optimization problems. To avoid excessive computation, an iterative scheme is given for SAR models, which gives approximate ML estimates in the Gaussian case and reasonably good estimates in some non-Gaussian situations as well. Likewise, for CM models, an easily computable consistent estimate is given. The asymptotic mean-squared error (mse) of this estimate for a four-neighbor CM model is shown tn be substantially less than the mse of the popular coding estimate. Asymptotically consistent decision rules are given for choosing an appropriate SAR or CM model. The usefulness of the estimation scheme and the decision rule for the choice of neighbors is illustrated by using synthetic patterns. Synthetic patterns obeying known SAR and CM models are generated, and the models corresponding to true and several competing neighbor sets are fitted. The estimation scheme yields estimates close to the parameters of the true models, and the decision rule for the choice of neighbors picks up the true model from the class of competing models."

An optimal recipe for classifying such patterns is described. It combines the use of an orthonormal expansion for the logarithm of probability functions, with the generation of a joint probability distribution from lower-order marginals. The unwieldy nature of the optimal recipe leads to the consideration of dependence represented by a Markov chain and a two-dimensional analog called a Markov mesh. The Markov chain has a \"reflecting\" property in that the r th order nonstationary chain implies that a point depends on its r nearest neighbors on each side. By scanning along a grid-filling curve so that the 2r neighbors of a point are geometrically close to it, certain spatial dependencies are obtained. The grid-filling curves are sequences of functions which have Hilbert \"space-filling\" curves as their limit. This simple approach does not provide for many of the spatial dependencies that should be considered. A novel extension of Markov chain methods into two dimensions leads to the Markov mesh which economically takes care of a much larger class of spatial dependencies. Likelihood ratio classification based on Markov chain and Markov mesh assumptions requires the estimation of a much smaller number of parameters than the general case. The development presented in this paper is new and need not be restricted to binary variables."

In this paper a model is used which explicitly includes nonlinear relations between intensity and film density, by use of the D-log E curve. Using Gaussian models for the image and noise statistics, a maximum a posteriori (Bayes) estimate of the restored image is derived. The MAP estimate is nonlinear, and computer implementation of the estimator equations is achieved by a fast algorithm based on direct maximization of the posterior density function. An example of the restoration method implemented on a digital image is shown."

The degradation is assumed to be due to a space invariant, periodic, nonseparable known point-spread function, and additive white noise. Our basic approach is to represent the images by a class of spatial interaction models, namely the simultaneous autoregressve models and the conditional Markov models defined on toroidal lattices, and develop minimum mean-squared error restoration algorithms using these models. The restoration algorithms are optimal, if the parameters characterizing the interaction models are exactly known. However, in practice, the parameters are estimated from the images. By using spatial interaction models, we develop restoration algorithms that do not require the availability of the original image or its prototype. The specific structure of the underlying lattice enables the implementation of the filters using fast Fourier transform (FFT) computations, Several restoration examples are given."

Therefore, the logical foundations of decision theory cannot be put in fully satisfactory form until the old problem of arbitrariness (sometimes called \"subjectiveness\") in assigning prior probabilities is resolved. The principle of maximum entropy represents one step in this direction. Its use is illustrated, and a correspondence property between maximum-entropy probabilities and frequencies is demonstrated. The consistency of this principle with the principles of conventional \"direct probability\" analysis is illustrated by showing that many known results may be derived by either method. However, an ambiguity remains in setting up a prior on a continuous parameter space because the results lack invariance under a change of parameters; thus a further principle is needed. It is shown that in many problems, including some of the most important in practice, this ambiguity can be removed by applying methods of group theoretical reasoning which have long been used in theoretical physics. By finding the group of transformations on the parameter space which convert the problem into an equivalent one, a basic desideratum of consistency can be stated in the form of functional equations which impose conditions on, and in some cases fully determine, an \"invariant measure\" on the parameter space."

Frequently, processes are needed which reduce ambiguity and noise, and select the best label among several possible choices. Relaxation labeling processes are just such a class of algorithms. They are based on the parallel use of local constraints between labels. This paper develops a theory to characterize the goal of relaxation labeling. The theory is founded on a definition of con-sistency in labelings, extending the notion of constraint satisfaction. In certain restricted circumstances, an explicit functional exists that can be maximized to guide the search for consistent labelings. This functional is used to derive a new relaxation labeling operator. When the restrictions are not satisfied, the theory relies on variational cal-culus. It is shown that the problem of finding consistent labelings is equivalent to solving a variational inequality. A procedure nearly identical to the relaxation operator derived under restricted circum-stances serves in the more general setting. Further, a local convergence result is established for this operator. The standard relaxation labeling formulas are shown to approximate our new operator, which leads us to conjecture that successful applications of the standard methods are explainable by the theory developed here. Observations about con-vergence and generalizations to higher order compatibility relations are described."

Boundaries may be those of a tank in an IR image, a spinal canal in a CAT scan, a cloud in a visible light image, etc. Or they may be internal to an object such as the boundary between a spherical surface and a cylindrical surface in a manufactured object. The focus of the paper is on parallel multiple-window boundary estimation algorithms. Here the image field is parti-tioned into an array of rectangular windows, and boundary finders are run simultaneously within the windows. The boundary segments found within the windows are then seamed together to obtain meaningful global boundaries. The entire procedure is treated within a maximum likelihood estimation framework that we have developed for boundary finding. Although our multiple-window estimation approach can be used with a number of local boundary finding algorithms, we concen-trate on one which is based on dynamic programming and will produce the true maximum likelihood boundary. Some theoretical considera-tions for boundary model design and boundary-finding runtime are covered. Included is the use of a low computational cost F-test for test-ing whether a window contains a boundary, and an analytical treatment which shows that use of coarse pixels with a chi-square test or an F-test improves the probability of correctly recognizing whether a boundary is present in a window."

It is assumed that the noise is additive, white, and uncorrelated with the signal. Practical application of the estimation technique is illustrated by applying the results to enhance several pictures. A comparison of this technique and its one-dimensional counterpart (Kalman filter) is made, and generalization of the estimation technique to other autoregressive sources is considered."

The reader may wonder why the general theory is not stated in part 2 and then applied to the special problem. The answer is that the general theory appeared as a necessary generalization of theorems stated in part 2, after the two first parts had been written, and the author thought that he would not have enough time before this Symposium to reorganize the paper. Moreover, part 2 will be a good introduction to the general theory. In the introduction the author will begin with the general theory, and the reader who wishes to do so may begin with part 3. The problem considered in this theory is to find an explicit representation of Gaussian r.f.(1) of a real variable t that may be considered as the canonical form of this function. By subtraction of a known function, it may be reduced to a Gaussian r.f. phi(t) with identically zero expectation. Such a r.f. is generally defined by its covariance gamma(t(1),t(s)), or by a stochastic differential equation with a Cauchy condition. None of these methods gives an explicit representation of phi(t)."

Roughly, a random field with denumerable state space S is described by a probability measure \u03bc on the space \u03a9 = S T of all configurations of values from S on the generalized time set T. In this chapter we discuss certain extensions of Markov chains, called Markov fields which have been important objects of study in the recent development of probability theory. Only some of the highlights of this rich theory will be covered; we concentrate especially on the case T = \u2124 = the integers, where the connections with classical Markov chain theory are deepest."

My contribution to a conference at Sheffield in 1973 aimed, at least in part, to supply such a review and forms the basis of this monograph; but in these prefatory remarks I must still make clear what I decided to discuss, and what I have omitted. Broadly speaking, the coverage is that included in seminars and lectures I have given on this theme since 1969. We may divide problems of spatial pattern (in contrast with complete random chaos) into (i) detecting departures from randomness, Oi) analysing such departures when detected, for example, in relation to some stochastic model and (iii) special problems which require separate consideration; for example, sophisticated problems of pattern recognition in specific fields, such as the computer reading of handwriting or recognition of chromosomes."

The algorithm generates randomly the permutations of the stations of the traveling salesman trip, with probability depending on the length of the corresponding route. Reasoning by analogy with statistical thermodynamics, we use the probability given by the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution. Surprisingly enough, using this simple algorithm, one can get very close to the optimal solution of the problem or even find the true optimum. We demonstrate this on several examples.We conjecture that the analogy with thermodynamics can offer a new insight into optimization problems and can suggest efficient algorithms for solving them."
