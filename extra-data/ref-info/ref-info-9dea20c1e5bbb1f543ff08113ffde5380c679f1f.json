The resulting classifier, however, can be prohibitively slow and memory intensive due to the large amount of prototypes that need to be stored and used in the distance comparisons. In this paper we develop rich models for representing large subsets of the prototypes. These models are either used singly per class, or as basic building blocks in conjunction with the K-means clustering algorithm."

More complex, better suited distance measures are often expensive and rather ad-hoc (elastic matching, deformable templates). We propose a new distance measure which (a) can be made locally invariant to any set of transformations of the input and (b) can be computed efficiently. We tested the method on large handwritten character databases provided by the Post Office and the NIST. Using invariances with respect to translation, rotation, scaling, shearing and line thickness, the method consistently outperformed all other systems tested on the same databases."

To group the data into objects we use a mixture model which is trained with the EM algorithm. We have investigated characterizing the the probability distribution for the features of each object either in terms of an object model or by a Gaussian distribution. We compare the performance of these two approaches on a dataset containing six different stick-animals, and on a dataset consisting of seven hand gestures."

However, we often have high-level knowledge about the learning problem. In optical character recognition (OCR), for instance, we know that the classification should be invariant under a set of transformations like rotation or translation. We propose a new modular classification system based on several autoassociative multilayer perceptrons which allows the efficient incorporation of such knowledge. Results are reported on the NIST database of upper case handwritten letters and compared to other approaches to the invariance problem."

One fruitful approach is to build a parameterized stochastic generative model, independent draws from which are likely to produce the patterns. For all but the simplest generative models, each pattern can be generated in exponentially many ways. It is thus intractable to adjust the parameters to maximize the probability of the observed patterns. We describe a way of finessing this combinatorial explosion by maximizing an easily computed lower bound on the probability of the observations. Our method can be viewed as a form of hierarchical self-supervised learning that may relate to the function of bottom-up and top-down cortical processing pathways."

It then uses a set of generative weights to convert the code vector into an approximate reconstruction of the input vector. We derive an objective function for training autoencoders based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. The aim is to minimize the information required to describe both the code vector and the reconstruction error. We show that this information is minimized by choosing code vectors stochastically according to a Boltzmann distribution, where the generative weights define the energy of each possible code vector given the input vector. Unfortunately, if the code vectors use distributed representations, it is exponentially expensive to compute this Boltzmann distribution because it involves all possible code vectors. We show that the recognition weights of an autoencoder can be used to compute an approximation to the Boltzmann distribution and that this approximation gives an upper bound on the description length. Even when this bound is poor, it can be used as a Lyapunov function for learning both the generative and the recognition weights. We demonstrate that this approach can be used to learn factorial codes."

The primary goal of an unsupervised learning procedure is to optimize the quality of a system's internal representation. In this thesis, we present a general framework for describing unsupervised learning procedures based on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. The MDL principle states that the best model is one that minimizes the summed description length of the model and the data with respect to the model. Applying this approach to the unsupervised learning problem makes explicit a key trade off between the accuracy of a representation (i.e., how concise a description of the input may be generated from it) and its succinctness (i.e., how compactly the representation itself can be described). \nViewing existing unsupervised learning procedures in terms of the framework exposes their implicit assumptions about the type of structure assumed to underlie the data. While these existing algorithms typically minimize the data description using a fixed length representation, we use the framework to derive a class of objective functions for training self-supervised neural networks, where the goal is to minimize the description length of the representation simultaneously with that of the data. Formulating a description of the representation forces assumptions about the structure of the data to be made explicit, which in turn leads to a particular network configuration as well as an objective function that can be used to optimize the network parameters. We describe three new learning algorithms derived in this manner from the MDL framework. Each algorithm embodies a different scheme for describing the internal representation, and is therefore suited to a range of datasets based on the structure underlying the data. Simulations demonstrate the applicability of these algorithms on some simple computational vision tasks."
