The experiments performed over the Corel dataset show that our approach compares favorably with generative models that constitute the state-of-the-art (e.g. our model reaches 21.6% mean average precision with Blob and SIFT features, compared to 16.7% for PLSA, the best alternative)."

The novel contributions include a discriminant formulation of the problem, a multiple instance learning solution that enables the estimation of concept probability distributions without prior image segmentation, and a hierarchical description of the density of each image class that enables very efficient training. Compared to current methods of image annotation and retrieval, the one now proposed has significantly smaller time complexity and better recognition performance. Specifically, its recognition complexity is O(C/spl times/R), where C is the number of classes (or image annotations) and R is the number of image regions, while the best results in the literature have complexity O(T/spl times/R), where T is the number of training images. Since the number of classes grows substantially slower than that of training images, the proposed method scales better during training, and processes test images faster This is illustrated through comparisons in terms of complexity, time, and recognition performance with current state-of-the-art methods."

                "text": "Libraries have traditionally used manual image annotation for indexing and then later retrieving their image collections. However, manual image annotation is an expensive and labor intensive procedure and hence there has been great interest in coming up with automatic ways to retrieve images based on content. Here, we propose an automatic approach to annotating and retrieving images based on a training set of images. We assume that regions in an image can be described using a small vocabulary of blobs. Blobs are generated from image features using clustering. Given a training set of images with annotations, we show that probabilistic models allow us to predict the probability of generating a word given the blobs in an image. This may be used to automatically annotate and retrieve images given a word as a query. We show that relevance models allow us to derive these probabilities in a natural way. Experiments show that the annotation performance of this cross-media relevance model is almost six times as good (in terms of mean precision) than a model based on word-blob co-occurrence model and twice as good as a state of the art model derived from machine translation. Our approach shows the usefulness of using formal information retrieval models for the task of image annotation and retrieval."

Our approach is predicated on the assumption that each image is generated by a sparse set of visual \u201ccauses\u201d and that images which are visually similar share causes. We propose a mechanism for computing a very large number of highly selective features which capture some aspects of this causal structure (in our implementation there are over 46,000 highly selective features). At query time a user selects a few example images, and the AdaBoost algorithm is used to learn a classification function which depends on a small number of the most appropriate features. This yields a highly efficient classification function. In addition we show that the AdaBoost framework provides a natural mechanism for the incorporation of relevance feedback. Finally we show results on a wide variety of image queries."

Intuitively, a good information retrieval system should present relevant documents high in the ranking, with less relevant documents following below. While previous approaches to learning retrieval functions from examples exist, they typically require training data generated from relevance judgments by experts. This makes them difficult and expensive to apply. The goal of this paper is to develop a method that utilizes clickthrough data for training, namely the query-log of the search engine in connection with the log of links the users clicked on in the presented ranking. Such clickthrough data is available in abundance and can be recorded at very low cost. Taking a Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, this paper presents a method for learning retrieval functions. From a theoretical perspective, this method is shown to be well-founded in a risk minimization framework. Furthermore, it is shown to be feasible even for large sets of queries and features. The theoretical results are verified in a controlled experiment. It shows that the method can effectively adapt the retrieval function of a meta-search engine to a particular group of users, outperforming Google in terms of retrieval quality after only a couple of hundred training examples."

Our formulation provides answers to three open questions:(l) whether the invariant local features are suitable for scene (rather than object) classification; (2) whether unsupennsed latent space models can be used for feature extraction in the classification task; and (3) whether the latent space formulation can discover visual co-occurrence patterns, motivating novel approaches for image organization and segmentation. Using a 9500-image dataset, our approach is validated on each of these issues. First, we show with extensive experiments on binary and multi-class scene classification tasks, that a bag-of-visterm representation, derived from local invariant descriptors, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Second, we show that probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) generates a compact scene representation, discriminative for accurate classification, and significantly more robust when less training data are available. Third, we have exploited the ability of PLSA to automatically extract visually meaningful aspects, to propose new algorithms for aspect-based image ranking and context-sensitive image segmentation."

Here, we show how we can do both automatic image annotation and retrieval (using one word queries) from images and videos using a multiple Bernoulli relevance model. The model assumes that a training set of images or videos along with keyword annotations is provided. Multiple keywords are provided for an image and the specific correspondence between a keyword and an image is not provided. Each image is partitioned into a set of rectangular regions and a real-valued feature vector is computed over these regions. The relevance model is a joint probability distribution of the word annotations and the image feature vectors and is computed using the training set. The word probabilities are estimated using a multiple Bernoulli model and the image feature probabilities using a non-parametric kernel density estimate. The model is then used to annotate images in a test set. We show experiments on both images from a standard Corel data set and a set of video key frames from NIST's video tree. Comparative experiments show that the model performs better than a model based on estimating word probabilities using the popular multinomial distribution. The results also show that our model significantly outperforms previously reported results on the task of image and video annotation."

Unfortunately, basically every evaluation is done on a different subset of the image sets thus making comparison impossible.In this article, we compare different ways of evaluating the performance using a subset of the Corel images with the same CBIRSan d the same set of evaluation measures. The aim is to show how easy it is to get differing results, even when using the same image collection, the same CBIRS and the same performance measures. This pinpoints the fact that we need a standard database of images with a query set and corresponding relevance judgments (RJs) to really compare systems.The techniques used in this article to \"enhance\" the apparent performance of a CBIRSa re commonly used, sometimes described, sometimes not. They all have a justification and seem to change the performance of a CBIRS but they do actually not. With a larger subset of images it is of course much easier to generate even bigger differences in performance. The goal of this article is not to be a guide of how to make the \"apparent\" performance of systems look good, but rather to make readers aware of CBIRS evaluations and the importance of standardized image databases, queries and RJ."

We achieve this using a model developed in the statistical text literature: probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA). In text analysis, this is used to discover topics in a corpus using the bag-of-words document representation. Here we treat object categories as topics, so that an image containing instances of several categories is modeled as a mixture of topics. The model is applied to images by using a visual analogue of a word, formed by vector quantizing SIFT-like region descriptors. The topic discovery approach successfully translates to the visual domain: for a small set of objects, we show that both the object categories and their approximate spatial layout are found without supervision. Performance of this unsupervised method is compared to the supervised approach of Fergus et al. (2003) on a set of unseen images containing only one object per image. We also extend the bag-of-words vocabulary to include 'doublets' which encode spatially local co-occurring regions. It is demonstrated that this extended vocabulary gives a cleaner image segmentation. Finally, the classification and segmentation methods are applied to a set of images containing multiple objects per image. These results demonstrate that we can successfully build object class models from an unsupervised analysis of images."

Learning the joint distribution of image regions and words has many applications. We consider in detail predicting words associated with whole images (auto-annotation) and corresponding to particular image regions (region naming). Auto-annotation might help organize and access large collections of images. Region naming is a model of object recognition as a process of translating image regions to words, much as one might translate from one language to another. Learning the relationships between image regions and semantic correlates (words) is an interesting example of multi-modal data mining, particularly because it is typically hard to apply data mining techniques to collections of images. We develop a number of models for the joint distribution of image regions and words, including several which explicitly learn the correspondence between regions and words. We study multi-modal and correspondence extensions to Hofmann's hierarchical clustering/aspect model, a translation model adapted from statistical machine translation (Brown et al.), and a multi-modal extension to mixture of latent Dirichlet allocation (MoM-LDA). All models are assessed using a large collection of annotated images of real scenes. We study in depth the difficult problem of measuring performance. For the annotation task, we look at prediction performance on held out data. We present three alternative measures, oriented toward different types of task. Measuring the performance of correspondence methods is harder, because one must determine whether a word has been placed on the right region of an image. We can use annotation performance as a proxy measure, but accurate measurement requires hand labeled data, and thus must occur on a smaller scale. We show results using both an annotation proxy, and manually labeled data."

Kernel-based classification methods can learn complex decision boundaries, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences epsivnerally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast kernel function which maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in this space. This \"pyramid match\" computation is linear in the number of features, and it implicitly finds correspondences based on the finest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair first appears. Since the kernel does not penalize the presence of extra features, it is robust to clutter. We show the kernel function is positive-definite, making it valid for use in learning algorithms whose optimal solutions are guaranteed only for Mercer kernels. We demonstrate our algorithm on object recognition tasks and show it to be accurate and dramatically faster than current approaches"

Given labeled training data, Maximum Entropy is a statistical technique which allows one to predict the probability of a label given test data. The techniques allow for relationships between features to be effectively captured. and has been successfully applied to a number of language tasks including machine translation. In our case, we view the image annotation task as one where a training data set of images labeled with keywords is provided and we need to automatically label the test images with keywords. To do this, we first represent the image using a language of visterms and then predict the probability of seeing an English word given the set of visterms forming the image. Maximum Entropy allows us to compute the probability and in addition allows for the relationships between visterms to be incorporated. The experimental results show that Maximum Entropy outperforms one of the classical translation models that has been applied to this task and the Cross Media Relevance Model. Since the Maximum Entropy model allows for the use of a large number of predicates to possibly increase performance even further, Maximum Entropy model is a promising model for the task of automatic image annotation."

This task is generally performed by ranking the documents $d \\in C$ according to their similarity with respect to $q$, $sim (q,d)$. The identification of an effective function $a,b \\to sim(a,b)$ could be performed using a large set of queries with their corresponding relevance assessments. However, such data are especially expensive to label, thus, as an alternative, we propose to rely on hyperlink data which convey analogous semantic relationships. We then empirically show that a measure $sim$ inferred from hyperlinked documents can actually outperform the state-of-the-art {\\em Okapi} approach, when applied over a non-hyperlinked retrieval corpus."

The approaches use the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) texture feature as the source of image description. The first method divides the query and database images into equally sized blocks from which LBP histograms are extracted. Then the block histograms are compared using a relative L1 dissimilarity measure based on the Minkowski distances. The second approach uses the image division on database images and calculates a single feature histogram for the query. It sums up the database histograms according to the size of the query image and finds the best match by exploiting a sliding search window. The first method is evaluated against color correlogram and edge histogram based algorithms. The second, user interaction dependent approach is used to provide example queries. The experiments show the clear superiority of the new algorithms against their competitors."

Based on these groupings, effective indices can be built for an image database. The authors show how a specific high-level classification problem (city vs. landscape classification) can be solved from relatively simple low-level features suited for the particular classes. They have developed a procedure to qualitatively measure the saliency of a feature for classification problem based on the plot of the intra-class and inter-class distance distributions. They use this approach to determine the discriminative power of the following features: color histogram, color coherence vector DCT coefficient, edge direction histogram, and edge direction coherence vector. They determine that the edge direction-based features have the most discriminative power for the classification problem of interest. A weighted k-NN classifier is used for the classification. The classification system results in an accuracy of 93.9% when evaluated on an image database of 2,716 images using the leave-one-out method."

Semantic modeling stands for the classification of local image regions into semantic classes such as grass, rocks or foliage and the subsequent summary of this information in so-called concept-occurrence vectors. Using this semantic representation, images from the scene categories coasts, rivers/lakes, forests, plains, mountains and sky/clouds are retrieved. We compare two implementations of the method quantitatively on a visually diverse database of natural scenes. In addition, the semantic modeling approach is compared to retrieval based on low-level features computed directly on the image. The experiments show that semantic modeling leads in fact to better retrieval performance."

Firstly, images are segmented into regions, which are classified into region types using a variety of features. A mapping between region types and keywords supplied with the images, is then learned, using a method based around EM. This process is analogous with learning a lexicon from an aligned bitext. For the implementation we describe, these words are nouns taken from a large vocabulary. On a large test set, the method can predict numerous words with high accuracy. Simple methods identify words that cannot be predicted well. We show how to cluster words that individually are difficult to predict into clusters that can be predicted well -- for example, we cannot predict the distinction between train and locomotive using the current set of features, but we can predict the underlying concept. The method is trained on a substantial collection of images. Extensive experimental results illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the approach."

TRECVid completed its fifth annual cycle at the end of 2005 and in 2006 TRECVid will involve almost 70 research organizations, universities and other consortia. Throughout its existence, TRECVid has benchmarked both interactive and automatic/manual searching for shots from within a video corpus,automatic detection of a variety of semantic and low-level video features, shot boundary detection and the detection of story boundaries in broadcast TV news. This paper will give an introduction to information retrieval (IR) evaluation from both a user and a system perspective, high-lighting that system evaluation is by far the most prevalent type of evaluation carried out. We also include a summary of TRECVid as an example of a system evaluation bench-marking campaign and this allows us to discuss whether such campaigns are a good thing or a bad thing. There are arguments for and against these campaigns and we present some of them in the paper concluding that on balance they have had a very positive impact on research progress."

In contrast to the latter method which stems from linear algebra and performs a Singular Value Decomposition of co-occurrence tables, the proposed technique uses a generative latent class model to perform a probabilistic mixture decomposition. This results in a more principled approach with a solid foundation in statistical inference. More precisely, we propose to make use of a temperature controlled version of the Expectation Maximization algorithm for model fitting, which has shown excellent performance in practice. Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis has many applications, most prominently in information retrieval, natural language processing, machine learning from text, and in related areas. The paper presents perplexity results for different types of text and linguistic data collections and discusses an application in automated document indexing. The experiments indicate substantial and consistent improvements of the probabilistic method over standard Latent Semantic Analysis."

Our approach leverages recent advances in language modeling to directly estimate an accurate topic model in the target language, starting with a query in the source language. The model integrates popular techniques of disambiguation and query expansion in a unified formal framework. We describe how the topic model can be estimated with either a parallel corpus or a dictionary. We test the framework by constructing Chinese topic models from English queries and using them in the CLIR task of TREC9. The model achieves performance around 95% of the strong mono-lingual baseline in terms of average precision. In initial precision, our model outperforms the mono-lingual baseline by 20%. The main contribution of this work is the unified formal model which integrates techniques that are essential for effective Cross-Language Retrieval."

Support vector machines have been established as powerful learning algorithms with good generalization capabilities. We combine these two approaches and propose a general kernel method for recognition with local features. We show that the proposed kernel satisfies the Mercer condition and that it is, suitable for many established local feature frameworks. Large-scale recognition results are presented on three different databases, which demonstrate that SVMs with the proposed kernel perform better than standard matching techniques on local features. In addition, experiments on noisy and occluded images show that local feature representations significantly outperform global approaches."

The concept is implemented by a linked pair of Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) models.

On the other hand, local features in images have shown to be suitable representations for efficient object recognition. Therefore, it is natural to try to combine SVM approach with local features representation to gain advantages on both sides. We study in this paper the Mercer property of matching kernels which mimic classical matching algorithms used in techniques based on points of interest. We introduce a new statistical approach of kernel positiveness. We show that despite the absence of an analytical proof of the Mercer property, we can provide bounds on the probability that the Gram matrix is actually positive definite for kernels in large class of functions, under reasonable assumptions. A few experiments validate those on object recognition tasks."

The relative effectiveness of runs evaluated by different relevant document sets differed, confirming the hypothesis that different retrieval techniques work better for retrieving highly relevant documents.

TREC assessors frequently disagreed in their selection of the best page, and subsequent evaluation by best page across different assessors varied widely.

It works by first fitting a set with a Gaussian mixture, then evaluate an efficient kernel on the two fitted Gaussian mixtures. Furthermore, we show that this kernel can be extended to sets embedded in a feature space implicitly defined by another kernel, where Gaussian mixtures are fitted with the kernelized EM algorithm [6], and the kernel for Gaussian mixtures are modified to use the outputs from the kernelized EM. All computation depends on data only through their inner products as evaluations of the base kernel. The kernel is computable in closed form, and being able to work in a feature space improves its flexibility and applicability. Its performance is evaluated in experiments on both synthesized and real data."

This kernel permits discriminative estimation via, for instance, support vector machines, while exploiting the properties, assumptions, and invariances inherent in the choice of generative model. It satisfies Mercer\u2019s condition and can be computed in closed form for a large class of models, including exponential family models, mixtures, hidden Markov models and Bayesian networks. For other models the kernel can be approximated by sampling methods.

The method is based on recognizing that certain local binary patterns, termed \"uniform,\" are fundamental properties of local image texture and their occurrence histogram is proven to be a very powerful texture feature. We derive a generalized gray-scale and rotation invariant operator presentation that allows for detecting the \"uniform\" patterns for any quantization of the angular space and for any spatial resolution and presents a method for combining multiple operators for multiresolution analysis. The proposed approach is very robust in terms of gray-scale variations since the operator is, by definition, invariant against any monotonic transformation of the gray scale. Another advantage is computational simplicity as the operator can be realized with a few operations in a small neighborhood and a lookup table. Experimental results demonstrate that good discrimination can be achieved with the occurrence statistics of simple rotation invariant local binary patterns."

We systematically studied the features of: histograms in the Ohta color space; multiresolution, simultaneous autoregressive model parameters; and coefficients of a shift-invariant DCT. We demonstrate that performance is improved by computing features on subblocks, classifying these subblocks, and then combining these results in a way reminiscent of stacking. State of the art single-feature methods are shown to result in about 75-86% performance, while the new method results in 90.3% correct classification, when evaluated on a diverse database of over 1300 consumer images provided by Kodak."

Despite the fact that this type of problem is well understood, there are many issues to be considered in designing an SVM learner. In particular, for large learning tasks with many training examples, oo-the-shelf optimization techniques for general quadratic programs quickly become intractable in their memory and time requirements. SV M light1 is an implementation of an SVM learner which addresses the problem of large tasks. This chapter presents algorithmic and computational results developed for SV M light V2.0, which make large-scale SVM training more practical. The results give guidelines for the application of SVMs to large domains."

We first study ways to control the capacity of Perceptrons (mainly regularization parameters and early stopping), using the margin idea introduced with SVMs. After showing that under simple conditions a Perceptron is equivalent to an SVM, we show it can be computationally expensive in time to train an SVM (and thus a Perceptron) with stochastic gradient descent, mainly because of the margin maximization term in the cost function. We then show that if we remove this margin maximization term, the learning rate or the use of early stopping can still control the margin. These ideas are extended afterward to the case of MLPs. Moreover, under some assumptions it also appears that MLPs are a kind of mixture of SVMs, maximizing the margin in the hidden layer space. Finally, we present a very simple MLP based on the previous findings, which yields better performances in generalization and speed than the other models."
