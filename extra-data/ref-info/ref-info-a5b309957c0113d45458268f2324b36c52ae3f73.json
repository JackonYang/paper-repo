Subjects performed a scene-comprehension task in which they attempted to detect the incongruity in the relationship between an object and its real-world scene context. In 100 msec, presentations of line drawings of such scenes, objects could be in a normal location or else inappropriately positioned (e.g., a fire hydrant on top of a mailbox), sized (e.g., the hydrant looking larger than a truck) or appearing to float in air. The results from two experiments provide approximate boundary conditions under which prior familiarity with a specific scene will facilitate subsequent perceptual processing of that scene. Neither priming with a verbal label nor repeated 100 msec non-consecutive exposures were found to improve subsequent perceptual processing, but a single 500 msec, visual prime of the background itself was effective."

It was found that organized scenes with novel but possible interobject relations were recognized more accurately than either organized scenes with familiar interobject relations or unorganized scenes with impossible interobject relations. This finding was obtained for adults, 8- to 10-year-old children, and 5- to 8-year-old children who indicated concrete-operational ability in Piaget\u2019s conservation-of-liquid quantity task. The results were interpreted in conjunction with a two-stage model of scene processing involving the formation of a schema to represent a scene (Stage 1), and the operation of the schema in governing the further processing of detailed information in the scene (Stage 2). It was concluded that preoperational children can form schemata to represent organized scenes (Stage 1), but it is not until the emergence of concrete operations that these schemata become operational with respect to guiding the further processing of information in the scene (Stage 2)."

Running computer programs implement the methods and many examples illustrate their behavior. The input is a two-dimensional line-drawing of the scene, assumed to contain three-dimensional bodies possessing flat faces (polyhedra); some of them may be partially occluded. Suggestions are made for extending the work to curved objects. Some comparisons are made with human visual perception.

Two kinds of pictures were used: pictures of objects forming real-world scenes and unorganized collections of the same objects. The recognition test employed distractors that varied four types of information: inventory, spatial location, descriptive and spatial composition. Results emphasized the selective nature of schemata since superior recognition of one kind of information was offset by loss of another. Spatial location information was better recognized in real-world scenes and spatial composition information was better recognized in unorganized scenes. Organized and unorganized pictures did not differ with respect of inventory and descriptive information. The longer the pictures were studied, the longer subjects took to recognize them. Reaction time for hits, misses, and false alarms increased dramatically as presentation time increased from 5 to 60 sec. It was suggested that detection of a difference in a distractor terminated search, but that when no difference was detected, an exhaustive search of the available information took place."

In the present article, the general properties of frame theories are discussed with regard to their implications for psychological processes, and an experiment is presented which tests whether this approach yields viable predictions about the manner in which people comprehend and remember pictures of real-world scenes. Normative ratings were used to construct six target pictures, each of which contained both expected and unexpected objects. Eye movements were then recorded as subjects who anticipated a difficult recognition test viewed the targets for 30 sec each. Then, the subjects were asked to discriminate the target pictures from distractors in which either expected or unexpected objects had been changed. One consequence of the embeddedness of frame systems is that global frames may function as \"semantic pattern detectors,\" so that the perceptual knowledge in them could be used for relatively automatic pattern recognition and comprehension. Thus, subjects might be able to identify expected objects by using automatized encoding procedures that operate on global physical features. In contrast, identification of unexpected objects (i.e., objects not represented in the currently active frame) should generally require more analysis of local visual details. These hypotheses were confirmed with the fixation duration data: First fixations to the unexpected objects were approximately twice as long as first fixations to the expected objects. On the recognition test, subjects generally noticed only the changes that had been made to the unexpected objects, despite the fact that the proportions of correct rejections were made conditional on whether the target objects had been fixated. These data are again consistent with the idea that local visual details of objects represented in the frame are not neccesary for identification and are thus not generally encoded. Further, since subjects usually did not notice when expected objects were deleted or replaced with different expected objects, it was concluded that if two events instantiate the same frame, they may often be indistinguishable, as long as any differences between them are represented as arguments in the frame. Thus, for the most part, the only information about an event that is episodically \"tagged\" is information which distinguishes that particular event from others of the same general class. The data reinforce the utility of a frame theory approach to perception and memory."

An important aspect of vision is the choice of representations for the different kinds of information in a visual scene. In the early stages of the analysis of an image, the representations used depend more on what it is possible to compute from an image than on what is ultimately desirable, but later representations can be more sensitive to the specific needs of recognition. This essay surveys recent work in vision at M.I.T. from a perspective in which the representational problems assume a primary importance. An overall framework is suggested for visual information processing, in which the analysis proceeds through three representations; (1) the primal sketch, which makes explicit the intensity changes and local two-dimensional geometry of an image, (2) the 2 1/2-D sketch, which is a viewer-centered representation of the depth, orientation and discontinuities of the visible surfaces, and (3) the 3-D model representation, which allows an object-centered description of the three-dimensional structure and organization of a viewed shape. Recent results concerning processes for constructing and maintaining these representations are summarized and discussed. (Author)"

Our guess is that the resolution to this apparent discrepancy will be with the number of objects undergoing violations in a scene. With the jumbling operation, a large proportion of the objects in the scene would be undergoing Support, Position, and Size violations. In the current experiments, violations were applied to only a single object. These scenes remained well formed, with the objects undergoing violations interpretable by visual metaphor such as Goodyear sofa for Fig. 3. Schema-plus-correction and weird list are terms that have been used to describe such anomalies. But as the number (or proportion) of objects undergoing violations in a scene increases, at some point metaphor fails and the scene no longer appears to be integrated. It no longer is a scene, but instead resembles a display of unrelated objects (Biederman, 1981). Perhaps it would be at this point that innocent bystander effects are obtained. We are currently exploring this possibility. There are some scenes, such as junkyards or some store display windows, where many of the relations are typically violated. By the preceding account, such scenes should be more difficult to process, perhaps behaving like jumbled scenes. In a sense, they are analogous to sentences such as \"The words that I used in my memory experiment were: ashtray, justice, tree, shallow, glove, tuna, chalk, train, fatigue, newspaper, mission, rapid.\" The lack of an innocent bystander effect poses obstacles to attempts at using recognition memory as a measure of the encoding of a scene. Thus, Friedman (1979) demonstrated that an improbable object in a scene is readily remembered--to the detriment of the other objects in the scene."

The evidence for facilitation was that objects that appeared in a Base Condition, when uncamouflaged, could be more readily detected than objects that appeared alone. False alarm rates were lower when the target object (not the cued object) was improbable in the scene compared to when it was probable, as shown in Fig. 6.

Across subjects (sex, ethnic group, and grade level) verbal measures were poor predictors of recognition accuracy. Across stimuli, amount recalled and recognition accuracy were both related to amount of organization. Recognition was also a function of the type of transformations on the target that were used as distractors. For all transformations there was a close match between ability to recognize a transformation judgment of dissimilarity of the transformation to the target. The TORSCA multidimensional scaling technique was applied to the similarity judgments to obtain a representation of a memory space for the targets and their transformations. The structure of this space was highly consistent across subjects and indicated that transformations on meaningful pictures can be related to each other ir., stable ways. Location of transformations within the space was related to type of picture and amount of organization in the picture. RECALL AND RECOGNITION OF PICTURES BY CHILDREN OF ORGANIZATION AND OF DISTRACTOR SIMILP Jean M. Mandler 2 and Nancy University of CalilFornia, San Diego Washingtc Investigators exploring the visual memory systems children (Shepard, 1967; Standing, Conezio, and Haber, Scott, 1971) have shown that once subjects are exposed their ability to recognize previously seen pictures is Standing et al (1970) presented 2560 pictures and found pictures of. .95 or better. Haber (1970) has suggested nition may be essentially unlimited, and has contrasted for verbal materials. \"Unlimited\" is perhaps too stron since several variables are known to affect accuracy of 1) Similarity of distractors to target. Recogni single objects is directly related to similarity of the the latter are scaled along a single \"similarity\" dimen and Bahrick, 1967). When more complex pictures have be few experiments have systematically manipulated this va have used a random selection of distractors, chosen fro as the target items (e.g., photographs) but with conten study which used similar distractors (Dallett, Wilcox, found somewhat lower recognition rates, ranging from .6 attempt was made to define or scale degree of similarit Campione (1972), working with children, studied a singl"

The greater deleterious effect of an early (as opposed to late) processing error has been argued by Rumelhart (1977) to explain why garden-path sentences (\"The old man the boats.\") require longer pauses in their readings than syntactically disambiguated sentences (\"The merchants ship their wares.\") We thus have two measures of the relative accessibility of a relation. One is the degree to which the violation of that relation interferes with object detection. The second is the speed and accuracy of the detection of that violation itself. The accessibility of the relations is central to two general issues in scene perception. The first is whether the physical relations of Interposition and Support are accessed prior to the semantic relations. A bottom-up model that holds that physical relations are processed prior to semantic relations is compatible with theories positing that the processing for depth and space precede the accessing of meaning (e.g. Julesz, 1981; Gibson, 1966). Thus, Julesz (1981) distinguishes the \"immediate\" depth and contour information from slower \"deliberative\" processes through which meaning is achieved."

The greater deleterious effect of an early (as opposed to late) processing error has been argued by Rumelhart (1977) to explain why garden-path sentences (\"The old man the boats.\") require longer pauses in their readings than syntactically disambiguated sentences (\"The merchants ship their wares.\") We thus have two measures of the relative accessibility of a relation. One is the degree to which the violation of that relation interferes with object detection. The second is the speed and accuracy of the detection of that violation itself. The accessibility of the relations is central to two general issues in scene perception. The first is whether the physical relations of Interposition and Support are accessed prior to the semantic relations. A bottom-up model that holds that physical relations are processed prior to semantic relations is compatible with theories positing that the processing for depth and space precede the accessing of meaning (e.g. Julesz, 1981; Gibson, 1966). Thus, Julesz (1981) distinguishes the \"immediate\" depth and contour information from slower \"deliberative\" processes through which meaning is achieved. Gibson's \"direct\" perception (1966), through which information is picked up about the distribution of bodies in space, is another account where spatial processing occurs prior to the access of semantic relations."

This result holds true even when individual differences in dimension preferences are taken into account.

The model emphasizes 6\"s ability to initiate a successive processing stage as soon as sufficient information for a correct response has been gathered. This ability enables .? to capitalize on the variance of the times of the component processes by which the values of the different dimensions arc determined."
