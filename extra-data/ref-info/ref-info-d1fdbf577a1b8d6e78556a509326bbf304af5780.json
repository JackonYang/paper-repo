The resulting T-Recs system takes word bounding box information as input, and outputs the corresponding logical text block units. Starting with an arbitrary word as block seed the algorithm recursively expands this block to all words that interleave with their vertical neighbors. Since even smallest gaps of table columns prevent their words from mutual interleaving, this initial segmentation is able to identify and isolate such columns. In order to deal with some inherent segmentation errors caused by isolated lines, overhanging words, or cells spawning more than one column, a series of postprocessing steps is added. These steps benefit form a very simple distinction between type 1 and type 2 blocks: type 1 blocks are those of at most one word per line, all others are of type 2. This distinction allows the selective application of heuristics to each group of blocks. The conjoint decomposition of column blocks into subsets of table cells leads to the final block segmentation of a homogeneous abstraction level. These segments serve the final layout analysis which identifies table environments and cells that are stretching over several rows and/or columns."

The system identifies important conceptual parts (logical objects) within business letters, like recipient, sender or company-specific printings. Thereby, the system works completely independent of text recognition. Instead, it only utilizes geometric knowledge sources. These are: global geometric knowledge about logical object arrangements, and local geometric knowledge about formal features of logical objects (e.g. extensions, typical font sizes, etc). As a result, a document image is classified by labeling area items by corresponding logical object designators after hypothesizing and testing geometric properties of the captured physical units (layout objects). Due to this strategy, ANASTASIL can be envisioned as a key for expectation-driven further analysis of logical objects by text or graphic recognition. The system has been completely implemented and has achieved some remarkable results. It is composed of a low-level geometric analysis module for image processing tasks and a high-level geometric analysis module that performs logical labeling of layout objects. The implementation was done on a SUN 3/60 workstation in C and Common-Lisp and will be soon available in the MacIntosh environment."

It is very important to be able to classify table and figure areas automatically. Furthermore, in tables, the column and row in which a character string is located are very important pieces of information. To detect and analyze table areas, the following method is applied: First, areas that may contain tables or figures are distinguished from text areas by the presence of horizontal and vertical lines. Next, the areas are assumed to be table areas and are analyzed as such. A judgment is made on whether each of the areas can in fact be a table area or not; in this way, the actual table areas are detected. Finally, the structures of the areas are analyzed and character strings in the areas are arranged by using the DP matching method. This method was applied to sixty-five pages of Japanese technical papers, magazines, manuals for software programs, and pages including 34 table areas, 48 line drawing areas, and 35 image areas. As a result, 96.6 percent of the areas were detected correctly and 91.7 percent of the tables were analyzed and arranged correctly."

The algorithm has two parts: first a row labeling algorithm groups similar rows into clusters then, a column labeling algorithm identifies the column structure within each cluster. Each column structure is identified by a set of column separation intervals that are computed from the intervals representing the extent of the white spacing between consecutive word fragments. We formally describe a method for finding column separation intervals based on word fragment separation intervals. This method is based on constructing a closure of a set of line intervals under the operation of line intersection. The closure is maintained dynamically in a data structure which facilitates easy access to the elements within the closure. This technique is computationally less expensive than projection and search at the pixel level since word fragment acquisition is already required for document recognition applications."

Following the initial binarization and deskewing operations, the image is scanned to extract all horizontal and vertical lines that are present. The table's dimensions are estimated based on these lines. Unlike other systems, the procedure described does not depend on the sole existence of lines to mark the item blocks. White streams are recognized in both the horizontal and vertical direction as substitutes for any missing demarcation lines. A structure interpretation procedure uses the extracted demarcation information to identify each of the item blocks in the table. Subsequently, the interrelations of these item blocks are used to recognize the structure of the tabulated data.<<ETX>>"
