This paper shows that the accuracy of a naive Bayes text classi er can be signi cantly improved by taking advantage of a hierarchy of classes. We adopt an established statistical technique called shrinkage that smoothes parameter estimates of a data-sparse child with its parent in order to obtain more robust parameter estimates. The approach is also employed in deleted interpolation, a technique for smoothing n-grams in language modeling for speech recognition. Our method scales well to large data sets, with numerous categories in large hierarchies. Experimental results on three real-world data sets from UseNet, Yahoo, and corporate web pages show improved performance, with a reduction in error up to 29% over the traditional at classi er."

One can use existing classifiers by ignoring the hierarchical structure, treating the topics as separate classes. Unfortunately, in the context of text categorization, we are faced with a large number of classes and a huge number of relevant features needed to distinguish between them. Consequently, we are restricted to using only very simple classifiers, both because of computational cost and the tendency of complex models to overfit. We propose an approach that utilizes the hierarchical topic structure to decompose the classification task into a set of simpler problems, one at each node in the classification tree. As we show, each of these smaller problems can be solved accurately by focusing only on a very small set of features, those relevant to the task at hand. This set of relevant features varies widely throughout the hierarchy, so that, while the overall relevant feature set may be large, each classifier only examines a small subset. The use of reduced feature sets allows us to utilize more complex (probabilistic) models, without encountering the computational and robustness difficulties described above."

One important feature of the model is that the tf statistic, which usually appears in probabilistic IR models as a heuristic, is an integral part of the model. Another is that the variable length of documents is accounted for, without either making a uniform length assumption or using length normalization. The multinomial model employs independence assumptions which are similar to assumptions made in previous probabilistic models, particularly the binary independence model and the 2-Poisson model. The use of simulation to study the model is described. Performance of the model is evaluated on the TREC-3 routing task. Results are compared with the binary independence model and with the simulation studies."

The representation of the complex structure of documents has not received a great deal of previous attention, but we have found it to be an important factor in our work. We are exploring ways to use this structure and the hierarchical relations among patent subclasses to facilitate the classification of patents. Our approach is to derive a vector of terms and phrases from the most important parts of the patent to represent each document. We use both k-nearest-neighbor classifiers and Bayesian classifiers. The k-nearest-neighbor classifier allows us to represent the document structure using the query operators in the Inquery information retrieval system. The Bayesian classifiers can use the hierarchical relations among patent subclasses to select closely related negative examples to train more discriminating classifiers."

This paper shows that the accuracy of text classifiers trained with a small number of labeled documents can be improved by augmenting this small training set with a large pool of unlabeled documents. We present a theoretical argument showing that, under common assumptions, unlabeled data contain information about the target function. We then introduce an algorithm for learning from labeled and unlabeled text based on the combination of Expectation-Maximization with a naive Bayes classifier. The algorithm first trains a classifier using the available labeled documents, and probabilistically labels the unlabeled documents; it then trains a new classifier using the labels for all the documents, and iterates to convergence. Experimental results, obtained using text from three different realworld tasks, show that the use of unlabeled data reduces classification error by up to 33%."

Our analysis assumes a monotone conjunctive target concept, Boolean attributes that are independent of each other and that follow a single distribution, and the absence of attribute noise. We rst calculate the probability that the algorithm will induce an arbitrary pair of concept descriptions ; we then use this expression to compute the probability of correct classiication over the space of instances. The analysis takes into account the number of training instances, the number of relevant and irrelevant attributes, the distribution of these attributes, and the level of class noise. In addition, we explore the behavioral implications of the analysis by presenting predicted learning curves for a number of artiicial domains. We also give experimental results on these domains as a check on our reasoning. Finally, we discuss some unresolved questions about the behavior of Bayesian classiiers and outline directions for future research. we nd the current format more desirable.

K-nearest-neighbor, relevance feedback, and Bayesian independence classifers were applied individually and in combination. A combination of diierent classiiers produced better results than any single type of classiier. For this speciic medical categoriza-tion problem, new query formulation and weighting methods used in the k-nearest-neighbor classiier improved performance. 1 Introduction Past research in information retrieval has shown that one can improve retrieval eeectiveness by using multiple representations in indexing and query formulation 27] 19] 3] 11] and by using multiple search strategies 5] 24] 7]. In this work, we investigate whether we can attain similar improvements in the domain of text categorization by combining diierent representations and classiication methods. Our domain is the automatic assignment of ICD9 codes to dictated inpatient discharge summaries. There is a great deal of interest in automating the assignment of categories such as ICD9-CM and other codes to patient medical records. Many hours of human eeort go into this task. Because this coding determines reimbursement, it is important to accomplish this task as easily and as accurately as possible. The most common approaches use a large corpus of previously coded documents to infer codes for new documents. Many diierent algorithms have been used for text cate-gorization, including k-nearest-neighbor algorithms 6, 26, 18], Bayesian independence classiiers 13], relevance feedback 21], and rule-induction algorithms from machine learning , like decision trees 2, 16]. These categorization algorithms have been applied to many diierent subject domains, usually news stories, but also physics abstracts 9], and medical text 29]. We are following several of these approaches to automatic"

In this paper we study the properties of phrasal and clustered indexing languages on a text categorization task, enabling us to study their properties in isolation from query interpretation issues. We show that optimal effectiveness occurs when using only a small proportion of the indexing terms available, and that effectiveness peaks at a higher feature set size and lower effectiveness level for a syntactic phrase indexing than for word-based indexing. We also present results suggesting that traditional term clustering method are unlikely to provide significantly improved text representations. An improved probabilistic text categorization method is also presented."

In this paper, we describe an active learning method that uses a committee of learners to reduce the number of training examples required for learning. Our approach is similar to the Query by Committee framework, where disagreement among the committee members on the predicted label for the input part of the example is used to signal the need for knowing the actual value of the label. Our experiments are conducted in the text categorization domain, which is characterized by a large number of features, many of which are irrelevant. We report here on experiments using a committee of Winnowbased learners and demonstrate that this approach can reduce the number of labeled training examples required over that used by a single Winnow learner by l-2 orders of magnitude. 1.

Our analysis assumes a monotone conjunctive target concept, and independent, noise-free Boolean attributes. We calculate the probability that the algorithm will induce an arbitrary pair of concept descriptions and then use this to compute the probability of correct classification over the instance space. The analysis takes into account the number of training instances, the number of attributes, the distribution of these attributes, and the level of class noise. We also explore the behavioral implications of the analysis by presenting predicted learning curves for artificial domains, and give experimental results on these domains as a check on our reasoning."

This framework can be thought of as a spectrum of allowable dependence in a given probabilistic model with the Naive Bayes algorithm at the most restrictive end and the learning of full Bayesian networks at the most general extreme. While much work has been carried out along the two ends of this spectrum, there has been surprising little done along the middle. We analyze the assumptions made as one moves along this spectrum and show the tradeoffs between model accuracy and learning speed which become critical to consider in a variety of data mining domains. We then present a general induction algorithm that allows for traversal of this spectrum depending on the available computational power for carrying out induction and show its application in a number of domains with different properties."

The goal of the research described here is to automatically create a computer understandable world wide knowledge base whose content mirrors that of the World Wide Web. Such a knowledge base would enable much more effective retrieval of Web information, and promote new uses of the Web to support knowledge-based inference and problem solving. Our approach is to develop a trainable information extraction system that takes two inputs: an ontology defining the classes and relations of interest, and a set of training data consisting of labeled regions of hypertext representing instances of these classes and relations. Given these inputs, the system learns to extract information from other pages and hyperlinks on the Web. This paper describes our general approach, several machine learning algorithms for this task, and promising initial results with a prototype system."

By casting this problem in a decision theoretic framework, we are able to make use of probabilistic learning methods in conjunction with a notion of differential misclassification cost to produce filters Which are especially appropriate for the nuances of this task. While this may appear, at first, to be a straight-forward text classification problem, we show that by considering domain-specific features of this problem in addition to the raw text of E-mail messages, we can produce much more accurate filters. Finally, we show the efficacy of such filters in a real world usage scenario, arguing that this technology is mature enough for deployment."

These techniques are presented as a natural extension of weighting methods using information about the distribution of index terms in documents in general. A series of relevance weighting functions is derived and is justified by theoretical considerations. In particular, it is shown that specific weighted search methods are implied by a general probabilistic theory of retrieval. Different applications of relevance weighting are illustrated by experimental results for test collections."

                "text": "DNA translocation across bacterial membranes occurs during the biological processes of infection by bacteriophages, conjugative DNA transfer of plasmids, T-DNA transfer, and genetic transformation. The mechanism of DNA translocation in these systems is not fully understood, but during the last few years extensive data about genes and gene products involved in the translocation processes have accumulated. One reason for the increasing interest in this topic is the discussion about horizontal gene transfer and transkingdom sex. Analyses of genes and gene products involved in DNA transfer suggest that DNA is transferred through a protein channel spanning the bacterial envelope. No common model exists for DNA translocation during phage infection. Perhaps various mechanisms are necessary as a result of the different morphologies of bacteriophages. The DNA translocation processes during conjugation, T-DNA transfer, and transformation are more consistent and may even be compared to the excretion of some proteins. On the basis of analogies and homologies between the proteins involved in DNA translocation and protein secretion, a common basic model for these processes is presented."

The sequence of 12,068 kilobases defines 5885 potential protein-encoding genes, approximately 140 genes specifying ribosomal RNA, 40 genes for small nuclear RNA molecules, and 275 transfer RNA genes. In addition, the complete sequence provides information about the higher order organization of yeast's 16 chromosomes and allows some insight into their evolutionary history. The genome shows a considerable amount of apparent genetic redundancy, and one of the major problems to be tackled during the next stage of the yeast genome project is to elucidate the biological functions of all of these genes."

                "text": "Natural genetic transformation is the active uptake of free DNA by bacterial cells and the heritable incorporation of its genetic information. Since the famous discovery of transformation in Streptococcus pneumoniae by Griffith in 1928 and the demonstration of DNA as the transforming principle by Avery and coworkers in 1944, cellular processes involved in transformation have been studied extensively by in vitro experimentation with a few transformable species. Only more recently has it been considered that transformation may be a powerful mechanism of horizontal gene transfer in natural bacterial populations. In this review the current understanding of the biology of transformation is summarized to provide the platform on which aspects of bacterial transformation in water, soil, and sediments and the habitat of pathogens are discussed. Direct and indirect evidence for gene transfer routes by transformation within species and between different species will be presented, along with data suggesting that plasmids as well as chromosomal DNA are subject to genetic exchange via transformation. Experiments exploring the prerequisites for transformation in the environment, including the production and persistence of free DNA and factors important for the uptake of DNA by cells, will be compiled, as well as possible natural barriers to transformation. The efficiency of gene transfer by transformation in bacterial habitats is possibly genetically adjusted to submaximal levels. The fact that natural transformation has been detected among bacteria from all trophic and taxonomic groups including archaebacteria suggests that transformability evolved early in phylogeny. Probable functions of DNA uptake other than gene acquisition will be discussed. The body of information presently available suggests that transformation has a great impact on bacterial population dynamics as well as on bacterial evolution and speciation."

                "text": "Genetic competence develops as a global response of Bacillus subtilis to the onset of stationary phase, in glucose\u2010minimal salts\u2010based media. The onset of competence is accompanied by the expression of several late gene products that are required for the binding, processing and uptake of transforming DNA. A number of regulatory genes have been identified that are needed for the appropriate synthesis of the late gene products. The regulatory gene products include a number of known transcription factors, as well as several members of the bacterial two\u2010component regulatory system. Genetic analysis has suggested a scheme for the flow of regulatory information signaling the onset of competence. Most of these regulatory products appear to be involved in the response to nutritional status, while the components responsible for growth stage and cell\u2010type\u2010specific control remain unknown. The general implications of this scheme for post\u2010exponential expression are discussed."
