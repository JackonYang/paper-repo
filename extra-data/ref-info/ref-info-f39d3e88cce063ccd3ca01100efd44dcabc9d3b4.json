We incorporate statistical natural language processing in order to deal with free text. We demonstrate the current system on a difficult dataset, namely 10000 images of work from the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco. The images include line drawings, paintings, and pictures of sculpture and ceramics. Many of the images have associated free text which varies greatly from physical description to interpretation and mood. We use WordNet to provide semantic grouping information and to help disambiguate word senses, as well as emphasize the hierarchical nature of semantic relationships. This allows us to impose a natural structure on the image collection that reflects semantics to a considerable degree. Our method produces a joint probability distribution for words and picture elements. We demonstrate that this distribution can be used: (a) to provide illustrations for given captions, and (b) to generate words for images outside the training set. Results from this annotation process yield a quantitative study of our method. Finally, the annotation process can be seen as a form of object recognizer that has been learned through a partially supervised process."

Firstly, images are segmented into regions, which are classified into region types using a variety of features. A mapping between region types and keywords supplied with the images, is then learned, using a method based around EM. This process is analogous with learning a lexicon from an aligned bitext. For the implementation we describe, these words are nouns taken from a large vocabulary. On a large test set, the method can predict numerous words with high accuracy. Simple methods identify words that cannot be predicted well. We show how to cluster words that individually are difficult to predict into clusters that can be predicted well -- for example, we cannot predict the distinction between train and locomotive using the current set of features, but we can predict the underlying concept. The method is trained on a substantial collection of images. Extensive experimental results illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the approach."

This paper describes WBIIS (Wavelet-Based Image Indexing and Searching), a new image indexing and retrieval algorithm with partial sketch image searching capability for large image databases. The algorithm characterizes the color variations over the spatial extent of the image in a manner that provides semantically meaningful image comparisons. The indexing algorithm applies a Daubechies' wavelet transform for each of the three opponent color components. The wavelet coefficients in the lowest few frequency bands, and their variances, are stored as feature vectors. To speed up retrieval, a two-step procedure is used that first does a crude selection based on the variances, and then refines the search by performing a feature vector match between the selected images and the query. For better accuracy in searching, two-level multiresolution matching may also be used. Masks are used for partial-sketch queries. This technique performs much better in capturing coherence of image, object granularity, local color/texture, and bias avoidance than traditional color layout algorithms. WBIIS is much faster and more accurate than traditional algorithms. When tested on a database of more than 10 000 general-purpose images, the best 100 matches were found in 3.3 seconds."

Conventional block-based classi cation algorithms decide the class of a block by examining only the feature vector of this block and ignoring context information. In order to improve classi cation by context, an algorithm is proposed, which models images by two dimensional hidden Markov models (HMMs). The HMM considers feature vectors statistically dependent through an underlying state process assumed to be a Markov mesh, which has transition probabilities conditioned on the states of neighboring blocks from both horizontal and vertical directions. Thus, the dependency in two dimensions is re ected simultaneously. The HMM parameters are estimated by the EM algorithm. To classify an image, the classes with maximum a posteriori probability are searched jointly for all the blocks. Applications of the HMM algorithm to document and aerial image segmentation show that the algorithm outperforms CART , LVQ, and Bayes VQ."

Subsequent sections discuss computational steps for image retrieval systems. Step one of the review is image processing for retrieval sorted by color, texture, and local geometry. Features for retrieval are discussed next, sorted by: accumulative and global features, salient points, object and shape features, signs, and structural combinations thereof. Similarity of pictures and objects in pictures is reviewed for each of the feature types, in close connection to the types and means of feedback the user of the systems is capable of giving by interaction. We briefly discuss aspects of system engineering: databases, system architecture, and evaluation. In the concluding section, we present our view on: the driving force of the field, the heritage from computer vision, the influence on computer vision, the role of similarity and of interaction, the need for databases, the problem of evaluation, and the role of the semantic gap."

An image in the database, or a portion of an image, is represented by a set of regions, roughly corresponding to objects, which are characterized by color, texture, shape, and location. A measure for the overall similarity between images is developed as a region-matching scheme that integrates properties of all the regions in the images. The advantage of using this \"soft matching\" is that it makes the metric robust to poor segmentation, an important property that previous research has not solved. Integrated Region-Based Image Retrieval demonstrates an experimental image retrieval system called Simplicity (Semantics-sensitive Integrated Matching for Picture Libraries). This system validates these methods on various image databases, proving that such methods perform much better and much faster than existing ones. The system is exceptionally robust to image alterations such as intensity variation, sharpness variation, intentional distortions, cropping, shifting, and rotation. These features are extremely important to biomedical image databases since visual features in the query image are not exactly the same as the visual features in the images in the database.\" \"Integrated Region-Based Image Retrieval is an excellent reference for researchers in the fields of image retrieval, multimedia, computer vision and image processing.\"--BOOK JACKET."

Conventional block-based classification algorithms decide the class of a block by examining only the feature vector of this block and ignoring context information. In order to improve classification by context, an algorithm is proposed that models images by two dimensional (2-D) hidden Markov models (HMMs). The HMM considers feature vectors statistically dependent through an underlying state process assumed to be a Markov mesh, which has transition probabilities conditioned on the states of neighboring blocks from both horizontal and vertical directions. Thus, the dependency in two dimensions is reflected simultaneously. The HMM parameters are estimated by the EM algorithm. To classify an image, the classes with maximum a posteriori probability are searched jointly for all the blocks. Applications of the HMM algorithm to document and aerial image segmentation show that the algorithm outperforms CART/sup TM/, LVQ, and Bayes VQ."

Most current image database systems that perform query by content require a distance computation for each image in the database. Distance computations can be time consuming, limiting the usability of such systems. There is thus a need for indexing systems and algorithms that can eliminate candidate images without performing distance calculations. As user needs may change from session to session, there is also a need for run-time creation of distance measures. In this paper, we introduce FIDS, or `Flexible Image Database System.' FIDS allows the user to query the database based on user-defined polynomial combinations of predefined distance measures. Using an indexing scheme and algorithms based on the triangle inequality, FIDS can return matches to the query image without directly comparing the query images to much of the database. FIDS is currently being tested on a database of eighteen hundred images."

                "text": "Digital library access is driven by features but features are often context dependent and noisy and their relevance for a query is not always obvious This paper describes an approach for utilizing many data dependent user dependent and task dependent features in a semi automated tool Instead of requiring universal similarity measures or manual selection of relevant features the approach provides a learning algorithm for selecting and combining groupings of the data where groupings can be induced by highly spe cialized and context dependent features The se lection process is guided by a rich example based interaction with the user The inherent com binatorics of using multiple features is reduced by a multistage grouping generation weighting and collection process The stages closest to the user are trained fastest and slowly propagate their adaptations back to earlier stages The weighting stage adapts the collection stage s search space across uses so that in later interactions good groupings are found given few examples from the user Described is an interactive time imple mentation of this architecture for semi automatic within image segmentation and across image la beling driven by concurrently active color mod els texture models or manually provided group ings Issues for digital libraries Digital libraries of images video and sound are a rich area for pattern recognition research They also introduce a host of new problems and requirements since the range of possible queries is immense and requires the utilization of many spe cialized features Also systems for retrieval browsing and annotation i e classifying regions often must perform with only a small number of examples from a user i e an insuf cient amount of training data by traditional requirements Thus the area is doubly exciting since it presents the eld of pattern recognition with new challenges while beckoning in new applications One important issue for digital libraries is nding good models and similarity measures for comparing database en tries A part of this di culty is that feature extraction and comparison methods are highly data dependent see Figure This work was supported in part by BT PLC Hewlett Packard Labs and NEC for an example with texture Similarity measures are also user and task dependent as demonstrated by Figure Un fortunately these dependencies are not at this point under stood well enough especially by the typical digital library user to permit careful selection of the optimal measure be forehand Note that the multi resolution simultaneous auto regressive MRSAR model of which fares poorly com pared to the shift invariant eigenvector EV model in the above two examples scores clearly above the EV model on the standard Brodatz database On the same test data but for a perceptually motivated similarity criteria based on periodicity directionality and randomness both the EV and MRSAR models are beat by a new Wold based model Attempts to use intuitive texture features like coarseness contrast and directionality are appropri ate in some cases but do not fully determine all the qualities people might use in judging similarity Thus an a priori opti mal context dependent selection among similarity measures either by human or computer seems unlikely Next the scope of queries that databases need to address is immense Current computational solutions attempt to of fer location of perceptual content nd round red objects and objective content nd pictures of people in Boston Desirable queries also extend to subjective content give me a scene of a romantic forest task speci c content I need something with open space to place text collaborative con tent show me pictures children like and more An swering such queries requires a variety of features or meta data to be attached to the data in a digital library some of which may not be computable directly from the data The implication for algorithms is that they cannot rely on one model or one small set of carefully picked features but will have to drink from a veritable feature hydrant from which only a few drops may be relevant for the query Finally there is a signi cant need for semi automated ver sus fully automated tools Human computer synergy can make ill de ned tasks manageable and has the power to over come many of the problems of current pattern recognition tools An important application of semi automated tools is to assist the population of a database viz the creation of metadata A crucial technical issue for such tools is the selec tion and combination of existing features which features are most useful for a given query or annotation how should they be combined and which combinations are useful for the sys tem to remember so that it gets smarter with increased use This last point is important since not only are the queries immensely variable but the amount of training data i e ex amples provided by a user of what they do and don t want available at any instant is usually limited Hence a tool should strive to improve its generalization ability"

In our retrieval system, an image is represented by a set of segmented regions, each of which is characterized by a fuzzy feature (fuzzy set) reflecting color, texture, and shape properties. As a result, an image is associated with a family of fuzzy features corresponding to regions. Fuzzy features naturally characterize the gradual transition between regions (blurry boundaries) within an image and incorporate the segmentation-related uncertainties into the retrieval algorithm. The resemblance of two images is then defined as the overall similarity between two families of fuzzy features and quantified by a similarity measure, UFM measure, which integrates properties of all the regions in the images. Compared with similarity measures based on individual regions and on all regions with crisp-valued feature representations, the UFM measure greatly reduces the influence of inaccurate segmentation and provides a very intuitive quantification. The UFM has been implemented as a part of our experimental SIMPLIcity image retrieval system. The performance of the system is illustrated using examples from an image database of about 60,000 general-purpose images."

Instead of requiring universal similarity measures or manual selection of relevant features, the approach provides a learning algorithm for selecting and combining groupings of the data, where groupings can be induced by highly specialized features. The selection process is guided by positive and negative examples from the user. The inherent combinatorics of using multiple features is reduced by a multistage grouping generation, weighting, and collection process. The stages closest to the user are trained fastest and slowly propagate their adaptations back to earlier stages. The weighting stage adapts the collection stage's search space across uses, so that, in later interactions, good groupings are found given few examples from the user."

In contrast, most currently available computer vision systems fall far short of human performance in this task, and further, they are generally not capable of being able to assert the correctness of their judgments. In computerized stereo matching systems, correctness of the similarity/identity-matching is almost never guaranteed. In this paper, we explore the question of the extent to which judgments of similarity/identity can be made essentially error-free in support of obtaining a relatively dense depth model of a natural outdoor scene. We argue for the necessity of simultaneously producing a crude scene-specific semantic \"overlay\". For our experiments, we designed a wavelet-based stereo matching algorithm and use \"classification-trees\" to create a primitive semantic overlay of the scene. A series of mutually independent filters has been designed and implemented based on the study of different error sources. Photometric appearance, camera imaging geometry and scene constraints are utilized in these filters. When tested on different sets of stereo images, our system has demonstrated above 97 correctness on asserted matches. Finally, we provide a principled basis for relatively dense depth recovery."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

The analysis uses an overcomplete wavelet decomposition, which yields a description that is translation invariant. It is shown that this representation constitutes a tight frame of l(2) and that it has a fast iterative algorithm. A texture is characterized by a set of channel variances estimated at the output of the corresponding filter bank. Classification experiments with l(2) Brodatz textures indicate that the discrete wavelet frame (DWF) approach is superior to a standard (critically sampled) wavelet transform feature extraction. These results also suggest that this approach should perform better than most traditional single resolution techniques (co-occurrences, local linear transform, and the like). A detailed comparison of the classification performance of various orthogonal and biorthogonal wavelet transforms is also provided. Finally, the DWF feature extraction technique is incorporated into a simple multicomponent texture segmentation algorithm, and some illustrative examples are presented."

An image is represented by a set of regions, roughly corresponding to objects, which are characterized by color, texture, shape, and location. The system classifies images into semantic categories. Potentially, the categorization enhances retrieval by permitting semantically-adaptive searching methods and narrowing down the searching range in a database. A measure for the overall similarity between images is developed using a region-matching scheme that integrates properties of all the regions in the images. The application of SIMPLIcity to several databases has demonstrated that our system performs significantly better and faster than existing ones. The system is fairly robust to image alterations."

Each image is represented by feature vectors at several resolutions, which are statistically dependent as modeled by the underlying state process, a multiscale Markov mesh. Unknowns in the model are estimated by maximum likelihood, in particular by employing the expectation-maximization algorithm. An image is classified by finding the optimal set of states with maximum a posteriori probability. States are then mapped into classes. The multiresolution model enables multiscale information about context to be incorporated into classification. Suboptimal algorithms based on the model provide progressive classification that is much faster than the algorithm based on single-resolution hidden Markov models."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

Clustering large spatial databases is an important problem which tries to find the densely populated regions in the feature space to be used in data mining, knowledge discovery, or efficient information retrieval. A good clustering approach should be efficient and detect clusters of arbitrary shape. It must be insensitive to the outliers (noise) and the order of input data. We propose WaveCluster, a novel clustering approach based on wavelet transforms, which satisfies all the above requirements. Using multiresolution property of wavelet transforms, we can effectively identify arbitrary shape clusters at different degrees of accuracy. We also demonstrate that WaveCluster is highly efficient in terms of time complexity. Experimental results on very large data sets are presented which show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to the other recent clustering methods.

This algorithm is derived by minimizing a generalized Bayes/minimum description length (MDL) criterion using the variational principle. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum and combines aspects of snakes/balloons and region growing. The classic snakes/balloons and region growing algorithms can be directly derived from our approach. We provide theoretical analysis of region competition including accuracy of boundary location, criteria for initial conditions, and the relationship to edge detection using filters. It is straightforward to generalize the algorithm to multiband segmentation and we demonstrate it on gray level images, color images and texture images. The novel color model allows us to eliminate intensity gradients and shadows, thereby obtaining segmentation based on the albedos of objects. It also helps detect highlight regions."

                "text": "chapter deals with regression analysis; the sections are \u201c Introduction,\u201d \u2018The Data,\u201d \u201cBackground,\u201d \u201cThe Gauge\u201d (which includes a physical model), \u201cInvestigations,\u201d \u201cTheory (The Simple Linear Model, Model Mis\u008e t, Transformations, Residual Plots, Replicate Measurements, Con\u008e dence and Prediction Bands, Calibration, Maximum Likelihood, An Alternative),\u201d \u201cExercises,\u201d \u201cNotes,\u201d and \u201cReferences.\u201d I liked this book\u2014its organization, its presentation, and the style of writing. In my scanning, I did not catch any typographical errors. The work clearly gives the impression that these authors have taken the time to think through what they wanted to do and have made an effort to do it. The headings of the chapters listed previously indicate the depth of their coverage; I would like to highlight the contents of Appendix A, titled \u201cWriting Lab Reports.\u201d Everyone agrees how important developing writing and communication skills are. Here one can \u008e nd step-by-step instructions on such topics as organization, grammar (including examples of grammatical problems), clarity and structure of prose, and revising and proofreading. Quite frankly, I cannot think of any statistics book, particularly at this level and for this type of material, in which such discussions can be found. This appendix, even by itself, should be on the must-read list for all students, including graduate students. Of course, there are additional topics that one would like to see included. Some of these are even mentioned in the article titled \u201cTeaching Statistics Theory Through Applicaitons,\u201d (Nolan and Speed 1999, pp. 370\u2013375) by the same authors. The additional topics could include more details on things like the moment-generating function, the methods of deriving distributions of transformation of random variables, concepts of estimation such as suf\u008e ciency and minimum variance, and others. In fact, the authors might consider doing a second volume; that way more time and space can be devoted to more concepts. More guidelines on how to use a particular computer package (the authors mention two) in a given situation would be helpful; this could include step-by-step instructions and annotated printouts. I also think (the title of the book suggests this) that, given the nature of the material, this way of teaching would require (and greatly bene\u008e t from) a solid support mechanism from outside the classroom. An essential component of such support would have to be recitation and/or lab sections (as the authors have used) with dependable teaching assistants. It seems fair to say that the look and feel of many popular mathematical statistics books have not changed much in years. The standard formula is to do much theory \u008e rst and then some examples; many of these examples often appear as afterthoughts. Recently however, there have been calls for a change in this formula (e.g., see Cobb and Moore 1997). One suggestion is to shift the focus to problem solving, using existing (or developing new) mathematical-statistical and subject-matter theory rather than developing new theory to solve problems that could arise in the future. An implementation of this strategy would require a paradigm shift in the teaching of mathematical statistics, and that is easier said than done. However, it is worth pointing out that a similar paradigm shift did take place in the teaching of statistical methods a few years ago. As I recall, following discussions between academia and industry, textbooks began to appear that emphasized the problem-solving approach to learning statistics by providing more real-life examples and case studies. Thanks to these authors, there are a number of \u008e ne books and supplementary materials available now for teaching statistical methods, particularly at the undergraduate level. The present book could start a similar trend among the mathematical statistics textbooks."

This thesis presents a thorough discussion of a particular class of traffic models, namely the aggregation of ON/OFF traffic sources, called N-Burst. A special family of Matrix-Exponential (or Phase-Type) distributions -- called Truncated Power-Tail distributions -- is used for the ON time distribution in order to mimic LRD properties, while still remaining tractable for queueing analysis via Matrix-Analytic methods. In order to make the model applicable to realistic scenarios, adequate procedures for parameter estimation are developed, which are then applied to a set of actual data from measurements of inter-cell times in an IP-over-ATM network. The steady-state analysis of queueing models witch such LRD arrival processes reveals distinctively different behavior than for models without LRD properties: All performance parameters show several so-called blow-ups at particular, well-defined points in the parameter space of the model, at which performance deteriorates dramatically. The knowledge about the existence and the location of these blow-up points is crucial for any network design task. Applicable engineering rules for the purpose of performance oriented design are derived from the gained insights. In many scenarios, the steady-state analysis of such LRD models does not provide a satisfactory description of the performance behavior. Therefore, methods for transient analysis are developed and applied. The discussion of the transient results leads to new characterizations of the fluctuations in the performance behavior of such LRD models. Finally, a variation of the basic analytic queueing model is discussed in which the arrival process is throttled when congestion occurs in the network. The results of that analysis provide insights into the behavior of elastic traffic, such as assumed by the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) in the Internet. The contributions of the thesis are twofold: First, contributions to the methodology for performance analysis using Matrix-Analytic models with Long-Range Dependent properties are made. Second, the results from the performance analysis of the rather general N-Burst model class provide new insights for the network design task. Although the thesis is directed at modeling and performance evaluation of telecommunication systems, the methodologies can easily be transfered to related areas, such as storage systems and CPU job-times, both of which are known to be subject to the impact of highly fluctuating loads."
