It has been shown in network simulations on one-dimensional stimuli that visual invariances to shift and other transformations can be learned in an unsupervised fashion based on slow feature analysis. More recently, we have shown that slow feature analysis applied to image sequences generated from natural images using a range of spatial transformations results in units that share many properties with complex and hypercomplex cells of the primary visual cortex. We find cells responsive to Gabor stimuli with phase invariance, sharpened or widened orientation or frequency tuning, secondary response lobes, end-stopping, and cells selective for direction of motion. These results indicate that slowness may be an important principle of self-organization in the visual cortex."

Most models have considered the nongaussian properties of static image patches, leading to sparse coding or independent component analysis. Here we consider the basic time dependencies of image sequences instead of their nongaussianity. We show that simple-cell-type receptive fields emerge when temporal response strength correlation is maximized for natural image sequences. Thus, temporal response strength correlation, which is a nonlinear measure of temporal coherence, provides an alternative to sparseness in modeling simple-cell receptive field properties. Our results also suggest an interpretation of simple cells in terms of invariant coding principles, which have previously been used to explain complex-cell receptive fields."

One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding7\u201312. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties13\u201318, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal8,12 that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs."

For neurons with complex, nonlinear response properties, characterization of feature representation requires measurement of their responses to a large ensemble of visual stimuli and an analysis technique that allows identification of relevant features in the stimuli. In the present study, we recorded the responses of complex cells in the primary visual cortex of the cat to spatiotemporal random-bar stimuli and applied spike-triggered correlation analysis of the stimulus ensemble. For each complex cell, we were able to isolate a small number of relevant features from a large number of null features in the random-bar stimuli. Using these features as visual stimuli, we found that each relevant feature excited the neuron effectively in isolation and contributed to the response additively when combined with other features. In contrast, the null features evoked little or no response in isolation and divisively suppressed the responses to relevant features. Thus, for each cortical complex cell, visual inputs can be decomposed into two distinct types of features (relevant and null), and additive and divisive interactions between these features may constitute the basic operations in visual cortical processing."

Histograms of spatial frequency bandwidth, orientation tuning bandwidth, aspect ratio and length of the receptive fields match well. This indicates that simple cells are well tuned to the expected statistics of natural stimuli. There is no match, however, in calculated and measured distributions for the peak of the spatial frequency response: the filters produced by ICA do not vary their spatial scale as much as simple cells do, but are fixed to scales close to the finest ones allowed by the sampling lattice. Possible ways to resolve this discrepancy are discussed."

What are the underlying rules that match the properties of complex cells in primary visual cortex to their natural stimuli? To address this issue, we sampled movies from a camera carried by a freely moving cat, capturing the dynamics of image motion as the animal explores an outdoor environment. We use these movie sequences as input to simulated neurons. Following the intuition that many meaningful high-level variables, e.g., identities of visible objects, do not change rapidly in natural visual stimuli, we adapt the neurons to exhibit firing rates that are stable over time. We find that simulated neurons, which have optimally stable activity, display many properties that are observed for cortical complex cells. Their response is invariant with respect to stimulus translation and reversal of contrast polarity. Furthermore, spatial frequency selectivity and the aspect ratio of the receptive field quantitatively match the experimentally observed characteristics of complex cells. Hence, the population of complex cells in the primary visual cortex can be described as forming an optimally stable representation of natural stimuli."

If we determine the parameters of linear transformations that make their output values as independent as possible when input data are natural images, we obtain parameter values that correspond to simple cell characteristics. It was also proved that, by making output values as temporally coherent as possible, simple cell characteristics also emerge. However, complex cell properties have not been fully explained by previous studies of natural image statistics. In this study, we examine whether we could reproduce complex cell properties by determining the parameters of two-layer networks that make their outputs as independent and sparse as possible or as temporally coherent as possible. Input\u2013output functions of two-layer networks correspond to quadratic forms and they form a class of functions that includes complex cell responses and many other functions. Therefore, we employed two-layer networks as a framework for discussing complex cell properties as in previous studies. By maximizing the independence and sparseness of output values of two-layer networks without considering the temporal structure of input images, squared responses of simple cells are obtained and complex cell properties are not reproduced. On the other hand, by maximizing the temporal coherence of output, we obtain complex cell properties among other kinds of input\u2013output functions. In previous studies, the measure of temporal coherence was the squared difference between the responses to two consecutive input images. We obtain two-layer networks that minimize this measure and show that some of them exhibit properties of complex cells but not clearly. We propose the sparseness of difference between responses to two consecutive inputs as an alternative measure of temporal coherence. We formulate an algorithm to maximize the sparseness of difference and show that complex cell properties emerge more clearly."

This raises the question how a subpopulation of cells can become specific to one feature and invariant to another, while a different subpopulation becomes invariant to the first but specific to the second feature. Using a colour image sequence recorded by a camera mounted to a cat's head, we train a population of neurons to achieve optimally stable responses. We find that colour sensitive cells emerge. Adding the additional objective of decorrelating the neurons' outputs leads a subpopulation to develop achromatic receptive fields. The colour sensitive cells tend to be non-oriented, while the achromatic cells are orientation-tuned, in accordance with physiological findings. The proposed objective thus successfully separates cells which are specific for orientation and invariant to colour from orientation invariant colour cells."

Many neurons in the visual cortex exhibit nonlinear responses, making it difficult to characterize their stimulus\u2013response relationships. Here, we recorded the responses of primary visual cortical neurons of the cat to spatiotemporal random-bar stimuli and trained artificial neural networks to predict the response of each neuron. The random initial connections in the networks consistently converged to regular patterns. Analyses of these connection patterns showed that the response of each complex cell to the random-bar stimuli could be well approximated by the sum of a small number of subunits resembling simple cells. The direction selectivity of each complex cell measured with drifting gratings was also well predicted by the combination of these subunits, indicating the generality of the model. These results are consistent with a simple functional model for complex cells and demonstrate the usefulness of the neural network method for revealing the stimulus\u2013response transformations of nonlinear neurons."

Slow feature analysis (SFA) is a new method for learning invariant or slowly varying features from a vectorial input signal. It is based on a nonlinear expansion of the input signal and application of principal component analysis to this expanded signal and its time derivative. It is guaranteed to find the optimal solution within a family of functions directly and can learn to extract a large number of decor-related features, which are ordered by their degree of invariance. SFA can be applied hierarchically to process high-dimensional input signals and extract complex features. SFA is applied first to complex cell tuning properties based on simple cell output, including disparity and motion. Then more complicated input-output functions are learned by repeated application of SFA. Finally, a hierarchical network of SFA modules is presented as a simple model of the visual system. The same unstructured network can learn translation, size, rotation, contrast, or, to a lesser degree, illumination invariance for one-dimensional objects, depending on only the training stimulus. Surprisingly, only a few training objects suffice to achieve good generalization to new objects. The generated representation is suitable for object recognition. Performance degrades if the network is trained to learn multiple invariances simultaneously."

End- and side-inhibition are present also in our simulation (Figure 10). We computed for each unit a quantitative measure of its degree of end- or side-inhibition by presenting sine gratings of different length and width (keeping all other parameters equal to the preferred ones). We define the end- and side-inhibition index as in DeAngelis et al. (1994) by the decrease of the response in percentage between optimal and asymptotic length and width, respectively. Out of 100 units, 10 had an end-inhibition index greater than 20%, and 7 units of 100 had a side-inhibition index greater than 20%. In contrast to DeAngelis et al. (1994) we found only 2 units that showed large (>20%) end- and side-inhibition simultaneously."

We computed for each unit a quantitative measure of its degree of end- or side-inhibition by presenting sine gratings of different length and width (keeping all other parameters equal to the preferred ones). We define the end- and side-inhibition index as in DeAngelis et al. (1994) by the decrease of the response in percentage between optimal and asymptotic length and width, respectively. Out of 100 units, 10 had an end-inhibition index greater than 20%, and 7 units of 100 had a side-inhibition index greater than 20%. In contrast to DeAngelis et al. (1994) we found only 2 units that showed large (>20%) end- and side-inhibition simultaneously. End- and side-inhibited units can sometimes be identified by looking directly at the optimal stimuli. In these cases x fills only one-half of the window while the missing half is covered by x with the same orientation and frequency (Figure 10a.1 and b.1). In this way, if we extend the stimulus into the missing half, the output receives an inhibitory contribution and drops. This receptive field organization is compatible with that observed in V1 by Walker et al. (1999) in that inhibition is asymmetric and is tuned to the same orientation and frequency as the excitatory part."

                "text": "1. The classically defined receptive field of a visual neuron is the area of visual space over which the cell responds to visual stimuli. It is well established, however, that the discharge produced by an optimal stimulus can be modulated by the presence of additional stimuli that by themselves do not produce any response. This study examines inhibitory influences that originate from areas located outside of the classical (i.e., excitatory) receptive field. Previous work has shown that for some cells the response to a properly oriented bar of light becomes attenuated when the bar extends beyond the receptive field, a phenomenon known as end-inhibition (or length tuning). Analogously, it has been shown that increasing the number of cycles of a drifting grating stimulus may also inhibit the firing of some cells, an effect known as side-inhibition (or width tuning). Very little information is available, however, about the relationship between end- and side-inhibition. We have examined the spatial organization and tuning characteristics of these inhibitory effects by recording extracellularly from single neurons in the cat's striate cortex (Area 17). 2. For each cortical neuron, length and width tuning curves were obtained with the use of rectangular patches of drifting sinusoidal gratings that have variable length and width. Results from 82 cells show that the strengths of end- and side-inhibition tend to be correlated. Most cells that exhibit clear end-inhibition also show a similar degree of side-inhibition. For these cells, the excitatory receptive field is surrounded on all sides by inhibitory zones. Some cells exhibit only end- or side-inhibition, but not both. Data for 28 binocular cells show that length and width tuning curves for the dominant and nondominant eyes tend to be closely matched. 3. We also measured tuning characteristics of end- and side-inhibition. To obtain these data, the excitatory receptive field was stimulated with a grating patch having optimal orientation, spatial frequency, and size, whereas the end- or side-inhibitory regions were stimulated with patches of gratings that had a variable parameter (such as orientation). Results show that end- and side-inhibition tend to be strongest at the orientation and spatial frequency that yield maximal excitation. However, orientation and spatial frequency tuning curves for inhibition are considerably broader than those for excitation, suggesting that inhibition is mediated by a pool of neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Recent applications of this approach have been successful in the prediction of the linear filtering properties of ganglion cells and simple cells, but the relations between the environmental statistics and cortical nonlinearities, like those of end-stopped or complex cells, are not yet fully understood. Here we present extensions of our previous investigations of the exploitation of higher-order statistics by nonlinear neurons. We use multivariate wavelet statistics to demonstrate that a strictly linear processing would inevitably leave substantial statistical dependencies between the outputs of the units. We then consider how the basic nonlinearities of cortical neurons - gain control and ON/OFF half-wave rectification - can exploit these higher-order statistical dependencies. We first show that gain control provides an adaptation to the polar separability of the multivariate probability density function (PDF), and, together with an output nonlinearity, enables an overcomplete sparse coding. We then consider how the remaining higher-order dependencies between different units can be exploited by a combination of basic ON/OFF point nonlinearities and subsequent weighted linear combinations. We consider two statistical optimization schemes for the computation of the optimal weights: principal component analysis (PCA) and independent component analysis (ICA). Since the intermediate nonlinearities transform some of the higher-order dependencies into second-order dependencies even the basic PCA approach is able to exploit part of the redundancies. ICA ignores this second-order structure, but can exploit higher-order dependencies. Both schemes yield a variety of nonlinear units which comprise the typical nonlinear processing properties, such as end-stopping, side-stopping, complex-cell properties and extra-classical receptive field properties, but the `ideal' complex cells seem only to occur with PCA. Thus, a combination of ON/OFF nonlinearities with an integrated PCA-ICA strategy seems necessary to exploit the statistical properties of natural images."

The properties of single cells in striate cortex of the rhesus monkey, representing the visual field 2 degrees -5 degrees from the fovea, were examined quantitatively with stationary and moving stimuli. Three distinct classes of cells were identified: S type, CX type, and T type. 2. S-type cells were defined as those oriented cells which to the optimal direction of movement in their receptive fields exhibited one or more spatially separate subfields within each of which a response was obtained to either a light or dark edge, but not to both. Several different types of S-cells were distinguished: a) S1-type cells for which moving edges revealed a single excitatory area within which a response was elicited by either a light or a dark edge but not by both. Most of these cells were unidirectional. b) S2-type cells for which moving edges revealed two spatially separate response areas, one of which was excited by a light edge and the other by a dark edge. Both regions responded to the same direction of movement. c) S3-type cells which had two response areas, one of which was excited by a stimulus moving in one direction (at right angles to the axis of orientation) and the other, of opposite contrast, which responded in the opposite direction, d) S4-type cells which to one direction of movement showed two spatially separate regions sensitive to a light and dark edge and which in the other direction of movement had only one responsive area (either light or dark). e) Cells which had multiple spatially separate subfields (S5-7 types). 3. CX-type cells were defined as those oriented cells which in their receptive fields exhibited no spatial separation for light- and dark-edge responses; they discharged to both edges in the same direction of movement and in the same spatial area. Flashing stimuli elicited both on and off responses throughout the receptive field. CX-type cells were predominantly of two types: those which were selective for direction of stimulus movement and those which were not. 4. A third class of cells (T-type) were those which were excited by only one sign of contrast change and responded in a sustained fashion even when there was no contour within the receptive field. These cells were poorly or not at all oriented; some of them were selective to wavelength. 5. Quantitative comparisons showed the following differences between S-type and CX-type cells: a) S-type cells had smaller receptive fields than CX-type cells but the populations over-lapped considerably. Receptive-field size was smallest in layer 4c. In all other layers S-type cells had the same size fields. CX-type cells, by contrast, tended to have larger fields in layer 5-6 than 2-3. b) The spatial separation between light and dark response areas was the best criterion for distinguishing S-type and CX-type cells. The distribution of this measure disclosed two populations of cells with relatively limited overlap. c) In layers 2 and 3, both S-type and CX-type cells had low spontaneous activity..."

Thus, for successful models, properties and parameters of the nonlinearity have to be specified using a priori knowledge, which often is missing. Here, we investigate adapting the nonlinearity simultaneously with the linear kernel. We use natural visual stimuli for training a simple model of the visual system. Many of the neurons converge to an energy detector matching existing models of complex cells. The overall distribution of the parameter describing the nonlinearity well matches recent physiological results. Controls with randomly shuffled natural stimuli and pink noise demonstrate that the match of simulation and experimental results depends on the higher-order statistical properties of natural stimuli."

The sparseness of a code can be measured by its kurtosis, where higher kurtosis corresponds to a sparser code (Willmore & Tolhurst, 2001). Interestingly, the kurtosis of our units (mean kurtosis 12.85 3.46) is much higher than that of their input (mean kurtosis 0.42 \u00b1 \u00b1 0.04). This is due to the selectivity characteristics of the units. They can therefore take advantage of the benefits of a sparse representation without being explicitly optimized for it. Figure 15 shows an excerpt of the activity trace of a unit and the distribution of its output in response to 400,000 test frames. In a complex cell in V1 the activity would be half rectified at some threshold because the firing rate cannot be negative. Statistical independence can be defined on the basis of higher order statistics, like in the studies cited above, or on the basis of second-order temporal statistics of the input signals. In this case, the correlation between different input signals at different time delays is minimized (Molgedey & Schuster, 1994; Belouchrani, Abed Meraim, Cardoso, & Moulines, 1997; Ziehe & M\u00fcller, 1998). Blaschke, Wiskott, and Berkes (2004) investigated the relation between SFA and second-order ICA and proved that in the linear case if only one time delay is considered both methods are equivalent."

                "text": "A number of recent attempts have been made to describe early sensory coding in terms of a general information processing strategy. In this paper, two strategies are contrasted. Both strategies take advantage of the redundancy in the environment to produce more effective representations. The first is described as a compact coding scheme. A compact code performs a transform that allows the input to be represented with a reduced number of vectors (cells) with minimal RMS error. This approach has recently become popular in the neural network literature and is related to a process called Principal Components Analysis (PCA). A number of recent papers have suggested that the optimal compact code for representing natural scenes will have units with receptive field profiles much like those found in the retina and primary visual cortex. However, in this paper, it is proposed that compact coding schemes are insufficient to account for the receptive field properties of cells in the mammalian visual pathway. In contrast, it is proposed that the visual system is near to optimal in representing natural scenes only if optimality is defined in terms of sparse distributed coding. In a sparse distributed code, all cells in the code have an equal response probability across the class of images but have a low response probability for any single image. In such a code, the dimensionality is not reduced. Rather, the redundancy of the input is transformed into the redundancy of the firing pattern of cells. It is proposed that the signature for a sparse code is found in the fourth moment of the response distribution (i.e., the kurtosis). In measurements with 55 calibrated natural scenes, the kurtosis was found to peak when the bandwidths of the visual code matched those of cells in the mammalian visual cortex. Codes resembling wavelet transforms are proposed to be effective because the response histograms of such codes are sparse (i.e., show high kurtosis) when presented with natural scenes. It is proposed that the structure of the image that allows sparse coding is found in the phase spectrum of the image. It is suggested that natural scenes, to a first approximation, can be considered as a sum of self-similar local functions (the inverse of a wavelet). Possible reasons for why sensory systems would evolve toward sparse coding are presented."

Most cells responded selectively to the spatial frequency of the sine-wave gratings. 4. The spatial frequency of the sine-wave grating eliciting the optimal response could not be predicted from the organization of the receptive field of each cell as determined by stationary or moving stimuli. 5. The sharpness of spatial-frequency selectivity is only slightly more pronounced in S-type cells than in CX-type cells. 6. S-type and CX-type cells differ significantly in the temporal modulation of their discharges to gratings. S-type cells discharge in sharp bursts to each cycle which traverses the receptive field. CX-type cells discharge in a rather continuous fashion. This measure can be used reliably to classify cells as S or CS type."

Evidence from a variety of methods suggests that a localized portion of the domestic chick brain, the intermediate and medial hyperstriatum ventrale (IMHV), is critical for object recognition. We have developed a neural network model of translation-invariant object recognition that incorporates features of the neural circuitry of IMHV, and exhibits behavior qualitatively similar to a range of findings in the filial imprinting paradigm. We derive several counter-intuitive behavioral predictions that depend critically upon the biologically derived features of the model. In particular, we propose that the recurrent excitatory and lateral inhibitory circuitry in the model, and observed in IMHV, produces hysteresis on the activation state of the units in the model and the principal excitatory neurons in IMHV. Hysteresis, when combined with a simple Hebbian covariance learning mechanism, has been shown in this and earlier work (Fldik 1991; O'Reilly and McClelland 1992) to produce translation-invariant visual representations. The hysteresis and learning rule are responsible for a sensitive period phenomenon in the network, and for a series of novel temporal blending phenomena. These effects are empirically testable. Further, physiological and anatomical features of mammalian visual cortex support a hysteresis-based mechanism, arguing for the generality of the algorithm."

The picture is moved over the receptive field of a neuron so that it can scan it along programmed lines. The activity of the neuron during the scanning procedure is presented in a two-dimensional dot display on scale with the original picture. By superposition of the stimulus and the transfer pattern, one can find out to which detail of a stimulus the neuron responds. Neurons in the first intracerebral relay of the visual system, the lateral geniculate body, reduce a complex stimulus, such as a photograph of a natural environment, to its contours. Cortical cells only respond to contours either of a limited or of a wider range of orientations (simple and complex cells, respectively). But the course of contours is only described by a continuous representation of these contours in the cortical map of the visual field. This is done by the simple cells, which have small receptive fields and thus a higher resolving power, whereas complex cells with their large receptive fields monitor the approximate location of a moving stimulus. The function of these two classes of neurons is discussed in terms of visual behavior, i.e., for fixation, hold, and binocular vergence movements (simple cells), and for detection of moving objects and motor command signals towards these objects (complex cells). These functions are an important condition for foveal vision which is the basis of perception in primates. An important function of orientation sensitivity of simple cells may be the binocular alignment of contours in binocular fusion and stereoscopic vision."

Sharpness of orientation selectivity was greater for simple (S type) than for complex (CX type) cells. CX-type cells became more broadly tuned in the deeper cortical layers: S-type cells were equally well tuned throughout the cortex. 3. Sharpness of orientation selectivity for S-type cells was similar at all retinal eccentricities studied (0 degrees - 20 degrees from the fovea):in CX-type cells orientation selectivity decreased slightly with increasing eccentricity. 4. The orientation tuning of binocular cells was similar when mapped separately through each eye. 5. Orientation selectivity and direction selectivity are independent of each other, suggesting that separate neural mechanisms give rise to them. 6. More CX-type cells can be binocularly activated than S-type cells (88% versus 49%). The ocular dominance of S-type cells is similar in all cortical layers: for CX-type cells there is an increase in the number of cells in ocular-dominance category 4 in layers 5 and 6."

Further, they are highly non-Gaussian, and this non-Gaussian character cannot be removed through local linear filtering. We find that including a simple \"gain control\" nonlinearity in the filtering process makes the filter output quite Gaussian, meaning information is maximized at fixed channel variance. Finally, we use the measured power spectrum to place an upper bound on the information conveyed about natural scenes by an array of receptors."

Selectivity could arise from enhancement of the cell's response by preferred stimuli, suppression by nonoptimal stimuli, or both. Here, we report that the majority of V1 neurons do not only elevate their activity in response to preferred stimuli, but their firing rates are also suppressed by nonoptimal stimuli. The magnitude of suppression is similar to that of enhancement. There is a tendency for net response suppression to peak at orientations near orthogonal to the optimal for the cell, but cases where suppression peaks at oblique orientations are observed as well. Interestingly, selectivity and suppression correlate in V1: orientation and spatial frequency selectivity are higher for neurons that are suppressed by nonoptimal stimuli than for cells that are not. This finding is consistent with the idea that suppression plays an important role in the generation of sharp cortical selectivity. We show that nonlinear suppression is required to account for the data. However, the precise structure of the neural circuitry generating the suppressive signal remains unresolved. Our results are consistent with both feedback and (nonlinear) feed-forward inhibition."

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

A key assumption is that perceptually salient visual parameters (e.g., surface depth) vary smoothly over time. This assumption is used to derive a learning rule that maximizes the long-term variance of each unit's outputs, whilst simultaneously minimizing its short-term variance. The length of the half-life associated with each of these variances is not critical to the success of the algorithm. The learning rule involves a linear combination of anti-Hebbian and Hebbian weight changes, over short and long time scales, respectively. This maximizes the information throughput with respect to low-frequency parameters implicit in the input sequence. The model is used to learn stereo disparity from temporal sequences of random-dot and gray-level stereograms containing synthetically generated subpixel disparities. The presence of temporal discontinuities in disparity does not prevent learning or generalization to previously unseen image sequences. The implications of this class of unsupervised methods for learning in perceptual systems are discussed."

This leads to the emergence of oriented linear filters that have simultaneous localization in space and in frequency, thus resembling Gabor functions and simple cell receptive fields. In this article, we show that the same principle of independence maximization can explain the emergence of phase- and shift-invariant features, similar to those found in complex cells. This new kind of emergence is obtained by maximizing the independence between norms of projections on linear subspaces (instead of the independence of simple linear filter outputs). The norms of the projections on such independent feature subspaces then indicate the values of invariant features."

                "text": "1. We consider the consequences of the orientation selectivity shown by most cortical neurons for the nature of the signals they can convey about the direction of stimulus movement. On theoretical grounds we distinguish component direction selectivity, in which cells are selective for the direction of movement of oriented components of a complex stimulus, from pattern direction selectivity, or selectivity for the overall direction of movement of a pattern irrespective of the directions of its components. We employed a novel test using grating and plaid targets to distinguish these forms of direction selectivity. 2. We studied the responses of 280 cells from the striate cortex and 107 cells from the lateral suprasylvian cortex (LS) to single sinusoidal gratings to determine their orientation preference and directional selectivity. We tested 73 of these with sinusoidal plaids, composed of two sinusoidal gratings at different orientations, to study the organization of the directional mechanisms within the receptive field. 3. When tested with single gratings, the directional tuning of 277 oriented cells in area 17 had a mean half width of 20.6 degrees, a mode near 13 degrees, and a range of 3.8-58 degrees. Simple cells were slightly more narrowly tuned than complex cells. The selectivity of LS neurons for the direction of moving gratings is not markedly different from that of neurons in area 17. The mean direction half width was 20.7 degrees. 4. We evaluated the directional selectivity of these neurons by comparing responses to stimuli moved in the optimal direction with those elicited by a stimulus moving in the opposite direction. In area 17 about two-thirds of the neurons responded less than half as well to the non-preferred direction as to the preferred direction; two-fifths of the units responded less than one-fifth as well. Complex cells showed a somewhat greater tendency to directional bias than simple cells. LS neurons tended to have stronger directional asymmetries in their response to moving gratings: 83% of LS neurons showed a significant directional asymmetry. 5. Neurons in both areas responded independently to each component of the plaid. Thus cells giving single-lobed directional-tuning curves to gratings showed bilobed plaid tuning curves, with each lobe corresponding to movement in an effective direction by one of the two component gratings within the plaid. The two best directions for the plaids were those at which one or other single grating would have produced an optimal response when presented alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Although general characteristics of this phenomenon have been reported previously, little is known about the detailed spatial organization of the surrounds. Previous work suggests that the surrounds may be uniform regions that encircle the CRF or may be limited to the \u201cends\u201d of the CRF. We have examined the spatial organization of surrounds of single-cell receptive fields in the primary visual cortex of anesthetized, paralyzed cats. The CRF was stimulated with an optimal drifting grating, whereas the surround was probed with a second small grating patch placed at discrete locations around the CRF. For most cells that exhibit suppression, the surrounds are spatially asymmetric, such that the suppression originates from a localized region. We find a variety of suppressive zone locations, but there is a slight bias for suppression to occur at the end zones of the CRF. The spatial pattern of suppression is independent of the parameters of the suppressive stimulus used, although the effect is clearest with iso-oriented surround stimuli. A subset of cells exhibit axially symmetric or uniform surround fields. These results demonstrate that the surrounds are more specific than previously realized, and this specialization has implications for the processing of visual information in the primary visual cortex. One possibility is that these localized surrounds may provide a substrate for figure\u2013ground segmentation of visual scenes."

These responses are generally thought to provide information about the orientation and position of lines and edges in the visual field. Some cells are also endstopped, that is selective for bars of specific lengths. Hubel and Wiesel first observed that endstopped hypercomplex cells1 could respond to curved stimuli and suggested they might be involved in detection of curvature, but the exact relationship between endstopping and curvature has never been determined. We present here a mathematical model relating endstopping to curvature in which the difference in response of two simple cells gives rise to endstopping and varies in proportion to curvature. We also provide physiological evidence that endstopped cells in area 17 of the cat visual cortex are selective for curvature, whereas non-endstopped cells are not, and that some are selective for the sign of curvature. The prevailing view of edge and curve determination is that orientations are selected locally by the class of simple cortical cells3 and then integrated to form global curves. We have developed a computational theory of orientation selection4,5 which shows that measurements of orientation obtained by simple cells are not sufficient because there will be strong, incorrect responses from cells whose receptive fields (RFs) span distinct curves (Fig. 1). If estimates of curvature are available, however, these inappropriate responses can be eliminated. Curvature provides the key to structuring the network that underlies our theory and distinguishes it from previous lateral inhibition schemes6,7."

Using the two-dimensional (2D) spatial and spectral response profiles described in the previous two reports, we test Daugman's generalization of Marcelja's hypothesis that simple receptive fields belong to a class of linear spatial filters analogous to those described by Gabor and referred to here as 2D Gabor filters. 2. In the space domain, we found 2D Gabor filters that fit the 2D spatial response profile of each simple cell in the least-squared error sense (with a simplex algorithm), and we show that the residual error is devoid of spatial structure and statistically indistinguishable from random error. 3. Although a rigorous statistical approach was not possible with our spectral data, we also found a Gabor function that fit the 2D spectral response profile of each simple cell and observed that the residual errors are everywhere small and unstructured. 4. As an assay of spatial linearity in two dimensions, on which the applicability of Gabor theory is dependent, we compare the filter parameters estimated from the independent 2D spatial and spectral measurements described above. Estimates of most parameters from the two domains are highly correlated, indicating that assumptions about spatial linearity are valid. 5. Finally, we show that the functional form of the 2D Gabor filter provides a concise mathematical expression, which incorporates the important spatial characteristics of simple receptive fields demonstrated in the previous two reports. Prominent here are 1) Cartesian separable spatial response profiles, 2) spatial receptive fields with staggered subregion placement, 3) Cartesian separable spectral response profiles, 4) spectral response profiles with axes of symmetry not including the origin, and 5) the uniform distribution of spatial phase angles. 6. We conclude that the Gabor function provides a useful and reasonably accurate description of most spatial aspects of simple receptive fields. Thus it seems that an optimal strategy has evolved for sampling images simultaneously in the 2D spatial and spatial frequency domains."

Motion sinformation can be extracted by a system that responds to the oriented spatiotemporal energy. We discuss a class of models for human motion mechanisms in which the first stage consists of linear filters that are oriented in space-time and tuned in spatial frequency. The outputs of quadrature pairs of such filters are squared and summed to give a measure of motion energy. These responses are then fed into an opponent stage. Energy models can be built from elements that are consistent with known physiology and psychophysics, and they permit a qualitative understanding of a variety of motion phenomena."

When given random dot stereograms of curved surfaces, this procedure learns to extract surface depth because that is the property that is coherent across space. It also learns how to interpolate the depth at one location from the depths at nearby locations (Becker and Hinton 1992b). In this paper, we propose two new models that handle surfaces with discontinuities. The first model attempts to detect cases of discontinuities and reject them. The second model develops a mixture of expert interpolators. It learns to detect the locations of discontinuities and to invoke specialized, asymmetric interpolators that do not cross the discontinuities."

Here we demonstrate, however, that neurons in the cat striate cortex (V1) show pronounced adaptation-induced short-term plasticity of orientation tuning primarily at specific foci. V1 neurons are clustered according to their orientation preference in iso-orientation domains that converge at singularities or pinwheel centres. Although neurons in pinwheel centres have similar orientation tuning and responses to those in iso-orientation domains, we find that they differ markedly in their capacity for adaptive changes. Adaptation with an oriented drifting grating stimulus alters responses of neurons located at and near pinwheel centres to a broad range of orientations, causing repulsive shifts in orientation preference and changes in response magnitude. In contrast, neurons located in iso-orientation domains show minimal changes in their tuning properties after adaptation. The anisotropy of adaptation-induced orientation plasticity is probably mediated by inhomogeneities in local intracortical interactions that are overlaid on the map of orientation preference in V1."

Higher order neurones in the visual pathway are presumably more concerned with relative changes in illumination, that is, contrast, because a great deal of information concerning absolute light level is processed at the retinal level3. It would therefore be of considerable functional value if cells in the visual cortex could adapt their response levels to a steady-state ambient contrast, in a manner analogous to the sensitivity control mechanism of the retina. We have examined here the idea that adaptation of neurones in the visual cortex to ambient contrast is similar to adaptation in the retina to ambient illumination. The experiments were performed by measuring contrast response functions (response amplitude as a function of contrast) of striate neurones, while systematically adapting them to different contrast levels. Our results show that, for the majority of cortical neurones, response\u2013contrast curves are laterally shifted along a log-contrast axis so that the effective domains of neurones are adjusted to match prevailing contrast levels. This contrast gain control mechanism, which was not observed for lateral geniculate (LGN) fibres, must be of prime importance to visual function."

Formally, This is like the differential rule proposed by Klopf (1986) and Kosko (1986), except for a change of sign, which gives it an anti-Hebbian character. By itself this rule is insufficient. A weight conservation condition is needed to prevent the weights from collapsing to zero, and some further constraintimplemented here by a biasing termto select particular sets of weights from the subspace of those which give minimal variation. As an example, I show that this rule will generate center-surround receptive fields that remove temporally varying linear gradients from the inputs."

The resulting characterization is in some aspects similar to that given by experimental studies of cortical cells, making it particularly suitable for application to second-order approximations and theoretical models of physiological receptive fields. We first discuss two ways of analyzing a quadratic form by visualizing the coefficients of its quadratic and linear term directly and by considering the eigenvectors of its quadratic term. We then present an algorithm to compute the optimal excitatory and inhibitory stimulithose that maximize and minimize the considered quadratic form, respectively, given a fixed energy constraint. The analysis of the optimal stimuli is completed by considering their invariances, which are the transformations to which the quadratic form is most insensitive, and by introducing a test to determine which of these are statistically significant. Next we propose a way to measure the relative contribution of the quadratic and linear term to the total output of the quadratic form. Furthermore, we derive simpler versions of the above techniques in the special case of a quadratic form without linear term. In the final part of the letter, we show that for each quadratic form, it is possible to build an equivalent two-layer neural network, which is compatible with (but more general than) related networks used in some recent articles and with the energy model of complex cells. We show that the neural network is unique only up to an arbitrary orthogonal transformation of the excitatory and inhibitory subunits in the first layer."

This article considers the effects of including chromatic and stereo information. The inclusion of colour leads to features divided into separate red/green, blue/yellow, and bright/dark channels. Stereo image data, on the other hand, leads to binocular receptive fields which are tuned to various disparities. The similarities between these results and the observed properties of simple cells in the primary visual cortex are further evidence for the hypothesis that visual cortical neurons perform some type of redundancy reduction, which was one of the original motivations for ICA in the first place. In addition, ICA provides a principled method for feature extraction from colour and stereo images; such features could be used in image processing operations such as denoising and compression, as well as in pattern recognition."

A fundamental question that is seldom addressed by these studies, however, is why the brain uses the types of representations it does and what evolutionary advantage, if any, these representations confer. It is difficult to address such questions directly via animal experiments. A promising alternative is to use probabilistic principles such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference to derive models of brain function. This book surveys some of the current probabilistic approaches to modeling and understanding brain function. Although most of the examples focus on vision, many of the models and techniques are applicable to other modalities as well. The book presents top-down computational models as well as bottom-up neurally motivated models of brain function. The topics covered include Bayesian and information-theoretic models of perception, probabilistic theories of neural coding and spike timing, computational models of lateral and cortico-cortical feedback connections, and the development of receptive field properties from natural signals."

We give a theoretical derivation of this scaling behaviour and show that it emerges from objects with a static power spectrum \u223cf\u2212m, appearing at a wide range of depths and moving with a distribution of velocities relative to the observer. We show that in the regime of relatively high temporal and low spatial frequencies the power spectrum becomes independent of the details of the velocity distribution and that it is separable into the product of spatial and temporal power spectra with the temporal part given by the u..."

                "text": "1. The iontophoretic application of the GABA antagonist bicuculline to simple and complex cells in the striate cortex of the cat produced extensive modifications of receptive field properties. These modifications appear to relate to a block or reduction of GABA\u2010mediated intracortical inhibitory influences acting on the cells examined. 2. For simple cells the effects of bicuculline on receptive field properties involved a loss of the subdivision of the receptive field into antagonistic \"on\" and \"off\" regions, a reduction in orientation specificity and a reduction or elimination of directional specificity. 3. The effect on the \"on\" and \"off\" subdivisions of the simple cell receptive field was such that all stationary flashing stimuli, whether covering the whole receptive field, or located within the receptive field over a previously determined \"on\" or \"off\" region, resulted in an \"on and off\" response. 4. The orientation specificity of complex cells was reduced during the application of bicuculline such that in many cases the original specificity of the cell was virtually lost with the response to the orientation at 90 degrees to the optimal being of similar magnitude to the optimal. The directional specificity of complex cells was generally less affected than that of simple cells. Often when large changes in orientation specificity were observed the directional specificity was relatively unaffected. 5. For some cells apparently showing to all visual stimuli only inhibitory responses, the application of bicuculline resulted in the appearance of excitatory responses. 6. In all cases receptive field properties reverted to the original state after termination of the bicuculline application. It was not generally possible to duplicate the effects of bicuculline by raising neuronal excitability with iontophoretically applied glutamate. 7. On the basis of these results it is suggested that the normal subdivision of the simple cell receptive field into separate \"on\" and \"off\" regions and its directional specificity are dependent on intracortical inhibitory processes that are blocked by bicuculline. The orientational tuning of simple cells conversely appears to be largely determined by the excitatory input but normally enhanced by lateral type inhibitory processes acting in the orientation domain. 8. It also appears that the excitatory input to some complex cells is not orientation specific. This suggests that for these cells it is extremely unlikely that they receive an orientation specific excitatory input from simple cells."

However, the term `sparse' has been used in two different ways - firstly to describe codes in which few neurons are active at any time (`population sparseness'), and secondly to describe codes in which each neuron's lifetime response distribution has high kurtosis (`lifetime sparseness'). Although these ideas are related, they are not identical, and the most common measure of lifetime sparseness - the kurtosis of the lifetime response distributions of the neurons - provides no information about population sparseness. We have measured the population sparseness and lifetime kurtosis of several biologically inspired coding schemes. We used three measures of population sparseness (population kurtosis, Treves-Rolls sparseness and `activity sparseness'), and found them to be in close agreement with one another. However, we also measured the lifetime kurtosis of the cells in each code. We found that lifetime kurtosis is uncorrelated with population sparseness for the codes we used. Lifetime kurtosis is not, therefore, a useful measure of the population sparseness of a code. Moreover, the Gabor-like codes, which are often assumed to have high population sparseness (since they have high lifetime kurtosis), actually turned out to have rather low population sparseness. Surprisingly, principal components filters produced the codes with the highest population sparseness."

The book is divided into three parts. Part I discusses the relationship between sensory stimuli and neural responses, focusing on the representation of information by the spiking activity of neurons. Part II discusses the modeling of neurons and neural circuits on the basis of cellular and synaptic biophysics. Part III analyzes the role of plasticity in development and learning. An appendix covers the mathematical methods used, and exercises are available on the book's Web site."

Given any set of statistically independent source signals, it is conjectured here that a linear mixture of those signals has the following property: the temporal predictability of any signal mixture is less than (or equal to) that of any of its component source signals. It is shown that this property can be used to recover source signals from a set of linear mixtures of those signals by finding an un-mixing matrix that maximizes a measure of temporal predictability for each recovered signal. This matrix is obtained as the solution to a generalized eigenvalue problem; such problems have scaling characteristics of O (N3), where N is the number of signal mixtures. In contrast to independent component analysis, the temporal predictability method requires minimal assumptions regarding the probability density functions of source signals. It is demonstrated that the method can separate signal mixtures in which each mixture is a linear combination of source signals with supergaussian, sub-gaussian, and gaussian probability density functions and on mixtures of voices and music."

In many situations, no a priori information on the mixing matrix is available: The linear mixture should be \"blindly\" processed. This typically occurs in narrowband array processing applications when the array manifold is unknown or distorted. This paper introduces a new source separation technique exploiting the time coherence of the source signals. In contrast with other previously reported techniques, the proposed approach relies only on stationary second-order statistics that are based on a joint diagonalization of a set of covariance matrices. Asymptotic performance analysis of this method is carried out; some numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
