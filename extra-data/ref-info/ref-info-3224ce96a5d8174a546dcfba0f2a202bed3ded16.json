In this work, we present algorithms for detecting and tracking text in digital video. Our system implements a scale-space feature extractor that feeds an artificial neural processor to detect text blocks. Our text tracking scheme consists of two modules: a sum of squared difference (SSD)-based module to find the initial position and a contour-based module to refine the position. Experiments conducted with a variety of video sources show that our scheme can detect and track text robustly."

Second , strokes are extracted from the segmented text regions, and then processed to form rectangular boxes surrounding the corresponding text strings. Multi-scale processing is used to account for signiicant font size variations. Third, text is extracted by cleaning up the background and binarizing the detected text strings. Finally , better text bounding boxes are generated by using the binarized text as strokes. Text is then cleaned and binarized from these new boxes, and can then be passed through a commercial OCR engine for recognition. The system is stable, robust, and works well on images (with or without structured layouts) from a wide variety of sources, including digitized video frames, photographs, newspapers, advertisements in magazines/newspapers, stock cer-tiicates, and personal checks.

The algorithms we propose make use of typical characteristics of text in videos in order to enhance segmentation and, consequently, recognition performance. As a result, we get segmented characters from video pictures. These can be parsed by any OCR software. The recognition results of multiple instances of the same character throughout subsequent frames are combined to enhance recognition result and to compute the final output. We have tested our segmentation algorithms in a series of experiments with video clips recorded from television and achieved good segmentation results."

Text either embedded or superimposed within video frames is very useful for describing the contents of the frames, as it enables both keyword and free-text based search, automatic video logging, and video cataloging. We have developed a scheme for automatically extracting text from digital images and videos for content annotation and retrieval. We present our approach to robust text extraction from video frames, which can handle complex image backgrounds, deal with different font sizes, font styles, and font appearances such as normal and inverse video. Our algorithm results in segmented characters that can be directly processed by an OCR system to produce ASCII text. Results from our experiments with over 5000 frames obtained from twelve MPEG video streams demonstrate the good performance of our system in terms of text identification accuracy and computational efficiency."

Target frames are selected at fixed time intervals from shots detected by a scene-change detection method. For each selected frame, segmentation by color clustering is performed around color peaks using a color histogram. For each color plane, text-lines are detected using heuristics, and the temporal and spatial position and the text-image of each text-line are stored in a database. Experimental results for text detection in video images and the performance of the method are reported for various video documents.
