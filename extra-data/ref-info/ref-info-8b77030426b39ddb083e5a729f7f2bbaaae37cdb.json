The class of solutions treated in this paper is quite different from the usual treatment in that the rigidity condition is relaxed so as to include the important class of bending deformations. For instance, we show a case in which important aspects of shape are obtained for a configuration of seven points, no four of which move in a rigid way, and which can be obtained from only two views. (This violates all requirements of the structure from motion theorem.) We discuss an algorithm that obtains the three-dimensional configuration of a polyhedral vertex up to a relief transformation (a similar transformation to the one that maps object to image space in paraxial optics), in the presence of arbitrary flections of the edges, from the projection and the instantaneous-movement parallax. Such a solution can, for instance, be used to predict side views of the vertex, as is demonstrated for a specific example. The solution can be used in an iterative fashion on triangulations to solve the case of extended curved surfaces suffering arbitrary bendings. The class of bending deformations encompasses all deformations that conserve distances along the surface (but not necessarily through space); thus stretchings are excluded. Practical examples include, e.g., deformations of flexible but nonstretchable shells. Actual numerical examples illustrate the practicability of the method."

We develop an algorithm to determine whether image data are compatible with a rigid interpretation. As a corollary of this result we find that the measure of false targets (roughly, nonrigid objects that appear rigid) is zero. We find that if the two views have at least one rigid interpretation, then in fact there is a canonical one-parameter family of rigid interpretations; we show how to compute this family, and we describe precisely how the rigid interpretations vary within it. Since only two views are used, this analysis is relevant also to stereo vision."

The author has analyzed the computations performed in the course of visual motion analysis. Workable schemes able to perform certain tasks performed by the visual system have been constructed and used as vehicles for investigating the problems faced by the visual system and its methods for solving them.Two major problems are treated: first, the correspondence problem, which concerns the identification of image elements that represent the same object at different times, thereby maintaining the perceptual identity of the object in motion or in change. The second problem is the three-dimensional interpretation of the changing image once a correspondence has been established.The author's computational approach to visual theory makes the work unique, and it should be of interest to psychologists working in visual perception and readers interested in cognitive studies in general, as well as computer scientists interested in machine vision, theoretical neurophysiologists, and philosophers of science."
