This paper presents a novel approach that uses machine learning to acquire knowledge for some of the higher level IE processing. Wrap-Up is a trainable IE discourse component that makes intersentential inferences and identifies logical relations among information extracted from the text. Previous corpus-based approaches were limited to lower level processing such as part-of-speech tagging, lexical disambiguation, and dictionary construction. Wrap-Up is fully trainable, and not only automatically decides what classifiers are needed, but even derives the feature set for each classifier automatically. Performance equals that of a partially trainable discourse module requiring manual customization for each domain."

                "text": "Knowledge-based natural language processing systems have achieved good success with certain tasks but they are often criticized because they depend on a domain-specific dictionary that requires a great deal of manual knowledge engineering. This knowledge engineering bottleneck makes knowledge-based NLP systems impractical for real-world applications because they cannot be easily scaled up or ported to new domains. In response to this problem, we developed a system called AutoSlog that automatically builds a domain-specific dictionary of concepts for extracting information from text. Using AutoSlog, we constructed a dictionary for the domain of terrorist event descriptions in only 5 person-hours. We then compared the AutoSlog dictionary with a hand-crafted dictionary that was built by two highly skilled graduate students and required approximately 1500 person-hours of effort. We evaluated the two dictionaries using two blind test sets of 100 texts each. Overall, the AutoSlog dictionary achieved 98% of the performance of the hand-crafted dictionary. On the first test set, the AutoSlog dictionary obtained 96.3% of the performance of the hand-crafted dictionary. On the second test set, the overall scores were virtually indistinguishable with the AutoSlog dictionary achieving 99.7% of the performance of the handcrafted dictionary."

It works essentially as a cascaded, nondeterministic finite state automaton. There are four steps in the operation of FASTUS. In Step (1) sentences are scanned for certain trigger words to determine whether further processing should be done. In Step (2) noun groups, verb groups, and prepositions and some other particles are recognized. The input to Step (3) is the sequence of phrases recognized in Step (2); patterns of interest are identified in Step (3) and corresponding incident structures are built up. In Step (4) incident structures that derive from the same incident are identified and merged, and these are used in generating database entries. FASTUS is an order of magnitude faster than any comparable system; it can process a news report in an average of less than eleven seconds. This translates directly into fast development time. In the three and a half weeks between its first use and the MUC-4 evaluation in May 1992, we were able to build up its domain knowledge to a point where it was among the leaders in the evaluation."

But a frequent objection to this solution is that finding things on an alphabetical list can be tedious and time-consuming. Many people who would like to refer to a dictionary decide not to bother with it because finding the information would interrupt their work and break their train of thought."

While these taggers obtain high accuracy, linguistic information is captured indirectly, typically in tens of thousands of lexical and contextual probabilities. In (Brill 1992), a trainable rule-based tagger was described that obtained performance comparable to that of stochastic taggers, but captured relevant linguistic information in a small number of simple non-stochastic rules. In this paper, we describe a number of extensions to this rule-based tagger. First, we describe a method for expressing lexical relations in tagging that stochastic taggers are currently unable to express. Next, we show a rule-based approach to tagging unknown words. Finally, we show how the tagger-can be extended into a k-best tagger, where multiple tags can be assigned to words in some cases of uncertainty."

We focus on the strengths and weaknesses of each learning method and describe how they can be integrated in a complementary fashion. The goal of this integration is to provide a learning architecture that accounts for the effects of prior knowledge on human learning. The integration helps to explain how a learner can learn rapidly when new experiences are consistent with prior knowledge while still retaining the ability to learn in novel domains (although more slowly). In addition, we present experimental evidence that an integrated model converges on accurate concepts more rapidly than either method applied individually.

Thus, a system with an incomplete or intractable explanatory mechanism will not be able to generalize some examples. It is not necessary, in those cases, to give up and resort to purely empirical generalization methods, because the system may already know almost everything it needs to explain the precedent. Learning by Failing to Explain is a method which exploits current knowledge to prune complex precedents and rules, isolating their mysterious parts. This paper describes two techniques for Learning by Failing to Explain: Precedent Analysis, partial analysis of a precedent or rule to isolate the mysterious new technique(s) it embodies; and Rule Re-analysis, re-analyzing old rules in terms of new rules to obtain a more general set."
