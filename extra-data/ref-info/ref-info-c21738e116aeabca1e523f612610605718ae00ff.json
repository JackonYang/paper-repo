The algorithm is based on the steerable filters of Freeman and Adelson (IEEE Trans. PAMI 13, 891-906, 1991), orientation-selective filters derived from derivatives of Gaussians. The filters are applied over multiple scales and their outputs non-linearly contrast-normalized. The data for humans were collected from forty subjects who were asked to identify 'the minimum number of dominant orientations' they perceived, and the 'strength' with which they perceived each orientation. Test data consisted of 111 grey-level images of natural textures taken from the Brodatz album, a standard collection used in computer vision and image processing. Results show that the computer and humans chose at least one of the same dominant orientations on 95 of the natural textures. Of these textures, 74 were also in 100% agreement on the location of all the dominant orientations chosen by both humans and computer. Disagreements are analyzed and possible causes are discussed. Some apparent limitations in the current filter shapes and sizes are illustrated, as well as some (surprisingly small) effects believed to be caused by semantic recognition and gestalt grouping."

The basic idea behind the algorithm is to use an oriented filter, namely the gradient of the Gaussian, and perform manipulations on the resulting gradient vector field. The most important aspect of the algorithm is that it is provably optimal in estimating the local orientations of an oriented texture. An added strength of the algorithm is that it is simpler and has a better signal-to-noise ratio than previous approaches, because it utilizes fewer derivative operations. Also proposed is a measure of coherence which is based on the use of the angle and coherence images as intrinsic images. An analysis of oriented textures requires the computation of these intrinsic images as a first step. In this sense, the computation of the orientation field, resulting in the intrinsic images, is indispensable in the analysis of oriented textures. Results from a number of experiments indicate the usefulness of the angle and coherence intrinsic images.<<ETX>>"

                "text": "Abstract : Two paradigms for visual analysis are top-down, starting from high-level models or information about the image, and bottom-up, where little is assumed about the image or objects in it. We explore a local, bottom-up approach to image analysis. We develop operators to identify and classify image junctions, which contain important visual cues for identifying occlusion, transparency, and surface bends. Like the human visual system, we begin with the application of linear filters which are oriented in all possible directions. We develop an efficient way to create an oriented filter of arbitrary orientation by describing it as a linear combination of basis filters. This approach to oriented filtering, which we call steerable filters, offers advantages for analysis as well as computation. We design a variety of steerable filters, including steerable quadrature pairs, which measure local energy. We show applications of these filters in orientation and texture analysis, and image representation and enhancement. We develop methods based on steerable filters to study structures such as contours and junctions. We describe how to post-filter the energy measures in order to more efficiently analyze structures with multiple orientations. We introduce a new detector for contours, based on energy local maxima. We analyze contour phases at energy local maxima, and compare the results with the prediction of a simple model. Using these tools, we analyze junctions. Based on local oriented filters, we develop simple mechanisms which respond selectively to T, L, and X junctions. The T and X junctions may indicate occlusion and transparency, respectively. These mechanism show that detectors for important, low-level visual cues can be built out of oriented filters and energy measures, which resemble responses found in the visual cortex. We present a second approach to junction detection based on salient contours."

                "text": "Visual texture segregation is the perceptual phenomenonillustrated in figure 17.1. In this image a rectangular areacomposed of small X-shaped patterns appears as a distinctregion against a background of L-shaped patterns. Thissegregation occurs rapidly and unconsciously, without effort or search. The rectangular area composed of T- shaped patterns, however, does not appear as a distinct region in this sense. It is very easy to discriminate amongall three pattems, but only the X and L regions displayspontaneous segregation. This distinction between pat- tern discrimination and perceptual segregation gives par-ticular interest to the study of this aspect of visual textureperception. Other aspects of texture perception include the role of texture in the perception of surface orientation and shape and the influence of surface texture in de-termining color appearance. In this paper we limit con-sideration to the phenomenon of segregation.Pure texture-based segregation is not a very importantphenomenon in everyday visual experience. Objects are not usually distinguished from their backgrounds purely by textural differences. In this respect, the study of puretexture differences (in the absence of differences in bright-ness, color, depth, or other properties) is analogous to thestudy of isoluminant color differences, which also are notvery common in natural scenes. The relative rarity ofisoluminant color discrimination in the real world does not imply that color perception is an unimportant compo-nent of seeing. Similarly, the rarity of pure texture differ-ences does not reduce the potential importance of textureperception, especially in the visual processing of complexscenes."

The channels are characterized by a bank of Gabor filters that nearly uniformly covers the spatial-frequency domain. A systematic filter selection scheme based on reconstruction of the input image from the filtered images is proposed. Texture features are obtained by subjecting each (selected) filtered image to a nonlinear transformation and computing a measure of energy in a window around each pixel. An unsupervised square-error clustering algorithm is then used to integrate the feature images and produce a segmentation. A simple procedure to incorporate spatial adjacency information in the clustering process is proposed. Experiments on images with natural textures as well as artificial textures with identical second and third-order statistics are reported.

It is shown that this corresponds to fitting an axis in the Fourier domain of the n-dimensional neighborhood, the solution of which is a well known solution of a matrix eigenvalue problem. The eigenvalues are the variance or inertia with respect to the axes given by their respective eigen vectors. The orientation is taken as the axis given by the least eigenvalue. Moreover it is shown that the necessary computations can be pursued in the spatial domain without doing a Fourier transformation. An implementation for 2-D is presented. Two certainty measures are given corresponding to the orientation estimate. These are the relative or the absolute distances between the two eigenvalues, revealing whether the fitted axis is much better than an axis orthogonal to it. The result of the implementation is verified by experiments which confirm an accurate orientation estimation and reliable certainty measure in the presence of additive noise at high level as well as low levels."

Steerable filters may be designed in quadrature pairs to allow adaptive control over phase as well as orientation. The authors show how to design and steer the filters and present examples of their use in the analysis of orientation and phase, angularly adaptive filtering, edge detection, and shape from shading. One can also build a self-similar steerable pyramid representation. The same concepts can be generalized to the design of 3-D steerable filters. >"

                "text": "Collagen fibers and their component fibrils make up the protenaceous \" backbone\" of most tissues and provide the majority of their resistance to tensile loading. Spatial orientation of collagen fibrils is an important factor in determining tissue properties. This is particularly true in ligament tissue, since ligaments must be loose enough to allow joints to move but tight enough to prevent joint surfaces from separating. A method is presented here to reproducibly quantify this collagen arrangement, which should be useful in studies on ligament healing and growth."
