We extend this model by (1) introducting positive feedback of a set of neurons onto itself and (2) allowing the individual neurons to saturate. Positive feedback forces the pattern of neural activity into stable corners of a high dimensionality hypercube. The model has behavior reminiscent of 'categorical perception' in that large regions of initial neural activity will end in the same corner. We wish to demonstrate that this model can serve as an efficient pre-processer, which takes a noisy stimulus, a spoken vowel, and puts it in a noise free standard form. As a test, we used acoustic representations of nine spoken Dutch vowels. We apply the model, and show that after several thousand learning trials, input vowels, initially close together, are associated with separate stable corners."

In seeking a functionally more relevant scheme, we have based our classification on three neural attributes; (a) size and shape of the dendritic domain, (b) presence or absence of dendritic spines, and (c) intra or extra\u2010cortical trajectory of the axon, as revealed in Golgi stained material. Our data indicate that neurons with extra\u2010cortically projecting axons (long axons) invariably possess spine\u2010rich dendrites forming domains with remarkably regular horizontal parameters (i.e. modular domains). Cells with axons limited to intra\u2010cortical paths (short axons) are characterized by spine\u2010poor or spine\u2010free dendrites forming domains which are highly variable in size and shape. These two categories appear dependant on structural characteristics related both to input and output functions of cortical neurons, and are called Class I and II, respectively. The significance of synaptic arrangements along horizontal and vertical components of Class I dendritic modules are compared with those for Class II cells, and possible relationships between dendritic structure and temporo\u2010spatial activity patterns are considered."

Applications to spacetime pattern learning and operant conditioning are then possible, if the conditioning is viewed as multi-channel Pavlovian conditioning in a highly inhomogeneous anatomy. In suitable anatomies, biases in learning because of axon collaterals with nonuniformly distributed diameters can be corrected if one properly couples the action potential to transmitter potentiation, and chooses signal velocity proportional to axon diameter. These anatomies can contain any number of cells. Anatomies exist in which patterns may be learned without their being practiced overtly, whereas persistent recall of old patterns without the learning of newly imposed patterns is impossible. Physiologically, this constraint has the trivial interpretation that signals from one cell to another first pass through the intervening synaptic knob. Mechanisms that control learning rates at times important to the network (e.g., reward and punishment times) can be discussed. Serial behavior like that described by Lashley is possible: this consists of sequential learning and performance of patterns faster than would be allowed by a motor-feedback control, at velocities influenced by arousal level, with the possibility of abrupt termination of performance if conflicting environmental demands arise. Analogs of pattern completion and mass action exist, as do phase transitions in memory (for some rate parameters and anatomies, memory is rigid, for others, it is plastic). The laws limit the ways in which these networks can be interconnected to yield specific discrimination, learning, memory, and recall capabilities."

The simplest of all learning models - the pattern model for simple learning is presented in which the population of available stimulation is ASSUMED TO COMPRISE A SET OF DISTINCT STIMULUS PATTERNS, EXACTLY ONE OF WHICH IS SAMPLED ON EACH TRIAL. In the important special case of the oneelement model, it is assumed that there is only one such pattern and that it recurs intact at the beginning of each experimenta trial. The oneelement model is worthy of study not only for expositional purposes but also for its value as an analytic device in relation to certain types of learning data. After a treatment of pattern models for simple acquisition an for learning under probabilistic reinforcement schedules, the conceptualization of generalization and transfer is discussed; the component models in which the patterns of stimulation effective on individual trials are treated, not as distinct elements, but as overlapping samples from a common population; and, finally, some examples of the more complex multiple-process models which are becoming increasingly important in the analysis of discrimination learning, concept formation, and related phenomena are discussed.

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

Denoting a key vector by q(p), and the data associated with it by another vector x(p), the pairs (q(p), x(p)) are memorized in the form of a matrix {see the Equation in PDF File} where c is a constant. A randomly selected subset of the elements of Mxq can also be used for memorizing. The recalling of a particular datum x(r) is made by a transformation x(r)=Mxqq(r). This model is failure tolerant and facilitates associative search of information; these are properties that are usually assigned to holographic memories. Two classes of memories are discussed: a complete correlation matrix memory (CCMM), and randomly organized incomplete correlation matrix memories (ICMM). The data recalled from the latter are stochastic variables but the fidelity of recall is shown to have a deterministic limit if the number of memory elements grows without limits. A special case of correlation matrix memories is the auto-associative memory in which any part of the memorized information can be used as a key. The memories are selective with respect to accumulated data. The ICMM exhibits adaptive improvement under certain circumstances. It is also suggested that correlation matrix memories could be applied for the classification of data."

                "text": "An introduction is given to a theory of early visual information processing. The theory has been implemented, and examples are given of images at various stages of analysis. It is argued that the first step of consequence is to compute a primitive but rich description of the grey-level changes present in an image. The description is expressed in a vocabulary of kinds of intensity change (EDGE, SHADING-EDGE, EXTENDED-EDGE, LINE, BLOB etc.). Modifying parameters are bound to the elements in the description, specifying their POSITION, ORIENTATION, TERMINATION points, CONTRAST, SIZE and FUZZINESS. This description is obtained from the intensity array by fixed techniques, and it is called the primal sketch. For most images, the primal sketch is large and unwieldy. The second important step in visual information processing is to group its contents in a way that is appropriate for later recognition. From our ability to interpret drawings with little semantic content, one may infer the presence in our perceptual equipment of symbolic processes that can define \"place-tokens\" in an image in various ways, and can group them according to certain rules. Homomorphic techniques fail to account for many of these grouping phenomena, whose explanations require mechanisms of construction rather than mechanisms of detection. The necessary grouping of elements in the primal sketch may be achieved by a mechanism that has available the processes inferred from above, together with the ability to select items by first order discriminations acting on the elements' parameters. Only occasionally do these mechanisms use downward-flowing information about the contents of the particular image being processed. It is argued that \"non-attentive\" vision is in practice implemented by these grouping operations and first order discriminations acting on the primal sketch. The class of computations so obtained differs slightly from the class of second order operations on the intensity array. The extraction of a form from the primal sketch using these techniques amounts to the separation of figure from ground. It is concluded that most of the separation can be carried out by using techniques that do not depend upon the particular image in question. Therefore, figure-ground separation can normally precede the description of the shape of the extracted form. Up to this point, higher-level knowledge and purpose are brought to bear on only a few of the decisions taken during the processing. This relegates the widespread use of downward-flowing information to a later stage than is found in current machine-vision programs, and implies that such knowledge should influence the control of, rather than interfering with, the actual data-processing that is taking place lower down."

Several statistical analyses were performed on 205 S-type and CX-type cells which had been completely analyzed on 12 response variables: orientation tuning, end stopping, spontaneous activity, response variability, direction selectivity, contrast selectivity for flashed or moving stimuli, selectivity for interaction of contrast and direction of stimulus movement, spatial-frequency selectivity, spatial separation of subfields responding to light increment of light decrement, sustained/transient response to flash, receptive-field size, and ocular dominance. 2. Correlation of these variables showed that within any cell group, these response variables vary independently. 3. A multivariate discriminant analysis showed that orientation specificity, receptive-field size, interaction of direction and contrast specificity ocular dominance, and spontaneous activity, taken together can adequately assign cells into the S-type or CX-type subgroups. 4. Various models of visual cortex are examined in view of the findings reported here and in the previous papers of this series, which suggest that a) orientation and direction selectivities are produced by separate neural mechanisms, b) there may be hierarchy among simple (S type) cells, and c) complex (CX-type) cells appear to receive a prominent S-type cell input."

The separate statements have in [act differed more in the language of their expression than in their substance. The major intent of the present paper is to explicate a more precise version of the form of theory involved, and to indicate how it may be usefully applied to a variety of phenomena in\u00b7 volving asso('iative learning. The impetus for a new theoretical model is not generally a new datum which dearly disconfirms existing theory. It is more likely to be the accumulation of a salient pattern of data, separate portions of which may be ade(luately handled by separate existing theories, but which apo pears to invite a more integrated theoretical account. Such, at least, is the better description of the background of the present work. In the sections which follow we will first describe certain data from our laboratories which exemplify the kind of observations which have encouraged the present theorizing. The theory will then be presented in sufficient detail to show how it may be applied to experimental situations involving a variety of Pavlovian conditioning arrangements. Finally, we will briefly discuss the theory in relationship to more conventional approaches."

                "text": "DAMAGE to striate cortex and neighbouring regions in man is well known to produce severe loss of visual capacity in correlated legions of the visual field (Holmes, 1918; Teuber, Battersby and Bender, 1960). Depending on the duration, nature and extent of the damage, and the method of measurement, the resultant blindness may be more or less absolute. In the most extreme examples, a patient may acknowledge no visual information or only the onset or offset of a light in the scotoma. In less extreme cases vigorously moving or flickering stimuli may be seen (Riddoch, 1917). It is generally held, however, that man is more severely impaired by damage to the visual cortex than the monkey, even though the anatomical organizations of the visual pathways and cortex are closely similar. Indeed, the more thoroughly the monkey has been studied, the more remarkable has been the extent of residual visual capacity found: for example, the ability to discriminate twodimensional patterns even when the whole of the striate cortex has been removed, with complete retrograde degeneration of the dorsal lateral geniculate nuclei (Pasik and Pasik, 1971). It has even been suggested that the monkey without striate cortex may be capable of qualitatively normal pattern vision but with reduced visual acuity (Weiskrantz, 1972; cf. Ward and Masterton, 1970). Recent animal results, however, also suggest strongly that a severe penalty is inflicted when damage to neighbouring posterior cortical areas is added to that of the striate cortex (Pasik and Pasik, 1971). For this reason, human cases in which damage is relatively restricted to area 17 (the only known cortical projection from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus), with only minimal damage to surrounding tissue, have a renewed interest. There also have been suggestions, based on animal research, that the type of visual information processed by the direct pathway from the retina to the mid-brain is qualitatively different from that by the geniculo-cortical route (the \"two visual system\" hypothesis: Schneider, 1969; Trevarthen, 1968; Ingle, 1967). The former, it has been claimed, is primarily concerned with the detection of \"salient\" visual events in space and the control of ocular fixation, and the latter with the identification"

                "text": "Anatomical and physiological studies in the peripheral auditory system of the bullfrog have shown that there are two auditory receptor organs within the frog's inner ear which are sensitive over nearly disjoint frequency ranges. Stimuli whose frequencies lie between these ranges have mainly an inhibitory effect upon the response of the nerve fibers that innervate the low-frequency organ. It has been shown that the mating call, which is produced by the male bullfrog and functions to evoke calling in other males, often contains energy peaks in just the frequency ranges to which the peripheral receptor organs are optimally sensitive. The auditory nerve fibers from both organs respond most vigorously to signals whose fine temporal structure is like that of the mating call, that is, to pulsatile signals having a repetition rate of about 100 per second. Behavioral studies employing synthetic croaks indicate that for a stimulus to evoke calling it is necessary that sufficient energy be simultaneously present in the frequency ranges that excite the two auditory organs; evoked calling can be suppressed by signal components which inhibit the neural responses from fibers that respond to energy in the low-frequency range. When spectral conditions are met, calling is maximal for signals which have a temporal structure that produces the maximum neural response. It is concluded that the periphery of the bullfrog's auditory system is specialized to detect the major spectral and temporal features of the mating call and that the evoked-calling response depends upon the simultaneous excitation of the peripheral auditory organs. The possible biological significance of the latter mechanism is discussed. The relation of the other calls that the bullfrog makes to the response characteristics of his peripheral auditory system is also considered, as well as comparable relations in other species of frogs."

Units were affected at the onset and/or termination of a stimulus, throughout a stimulus, or a combination. Best frequency of units ranged from less than 1 kHz to greater than 50 kHz. Over half the units responding to tone bursts exhibited a response range greater than 12 oct. Some units had double response ranges.

                "text": "I shall devote the body of this paper to a description of experiments with rats. But I shall also attempt in a few words at the close to indicate the significance of these findings on rats for the clinical behavior of men. Most of the rat investigations, which I shall report, were carried out in the Berkeley laboratory. But I shall also include, occasionally, accounts of the behavior of non-Berkeley rats who obviously have misspent their lives in out-of-State laboratories. Furthermore, in reporting our Berkeley experiments I shall have to omit a very great many. The ones I shall talk about were carried out by graduate students (or underpaid research assistants) who, supposedly, got some of their ideas from me. And a few, though a very few, were even carried out by me myself. Let me begin by presenting diagrams for a couple of typical mazes, an alley maze and an elevated maze. In the typical experiment a hungry rat is put at the entrance of the maze (alley or elevated), and wanders about through the various true path segments and blind alleys until he finally comes to the food box and eats. This is repeated (again in the typical experiment) one trial every 24 hours and the animal tends to make fewer and fewer errors (that is, blindalley entrances) and to take less and less time between start and goal-box until finally he is entering no blinds at all and running in a very few seconds from start to goal. The results are usually presented in the form of average curves of blind-entrances, or of seconds from start to finish, for groups of rats. All students agree as to the facts. They disagree, however, on theory and explanation. (1) First, there is a school of animal psychologists which believes that the maze behavior of rats is a matter of mere simple stimulus-response connections. Learning, according to them, consists in the strengthening of some of these connections and in the weakening of others. According to this \u2018stimulus-response\u2019 school the rat in progressing down the maze is helplessly responding to a succession of external stimulisights, sounds, smells, pressures, etc. impinging upon his external sense organs-plus internal stimuli coming from the viscera and from the skeletal muscles.

A family of statistical models, growing out of general mathematical learning theory, accounts for probability learning in terms of the accumulation in memory of weighted ensembles of associations between recurring situations and subsequent events. These models provide rather detailed quantitative accounts of probability learning in some especially simplified experimental situations. Also they provide vehicles for applying theoretical interpretations of probability learning to the problems of choice and decision making in social and economic contexts."

At each meeting, one of the group or an invited guest would read a paper on some scientific topic, generally one in which methods of methodology were the first consideration. General discussion followed, and the meetings were apparently not for those who were unable to stand frank criticism.

                "text": "Some 60 years ago, many biologists thought that bees and other insects were totally color-blind animals. I was unable to believe it. For the bright colors of flowers can be understood only as an adaptation to color-sensitive visitors. This was the beginning of experiments on the color sense of the bee (I). On a table outdoors I placed a colored paper between papers of different shades of gray and on it I laid a small glass dish filled with sugar syrup. Bees from a nearby hive could be trained to recognize this color and demonstrated their ability to distinguish it from shades of gray. To prevent too great a gathering of bees, I instituted breaks between feedings. After these breaks, only sporadic scout bees came to the empty bowl and flew back home; the feeding table remained deserted. If a scout bee, however, found the bowl filled and returned home successfully, within a few minutes the entire forager group was back. Had she reported her findings to the hive? This question subsequently became the starting point for further investigations. In order that the behavior of foragers could be seen after their return to the hive, a small colony was placed in an observation hive with glass windows, and a feeding bowl was placed next to it. The individual foragers were marked with colored dots, that is, numbered according to a certain system. Now an astonishing picture could be seen in the observation hive: Even before the returning bees turned over the contents of their honey sack to other bees, they ran over the comb in close circles, alternately to the right and the left. This round dance caused the numbered bees moving behind them to undertake a new excursion to the feeding place. But foragers from one hive do not always fly to the same feeding source. Foraging groups form: One may collect from dandelions, another from clover, and a third from forget-me-nots. Even in flowering plants the food supply often becomes scarce, and a \u201cfeeding break\u201d ensues. Were the bees in the experiment able to alert those very same foragers who were at the bowl with them? Did they know each other individually? To settle the question, I installed two feeding places at which two groups from the same observation hive collected separately. During a feeding break, both groups stayed on the honey-comb and mingled with each other. Then one of the bowls was refilled. The bees coming from the filled bowl alerted by their dances not only their own group but also bees of the second group, which responded by flying to their customary feeding place where they investigated the empty bowl. However, the natural stopping places of bees are not glass bowls but flowers. Therefore, the experiment was modified; one of two groups of bees collected food from linden blossoms, the other one from robinias. Now the picture"

There are updates throughout the book as well. These take into account important advances in cognitive psychology and the science of design while confirming and extending the book's basic thesis: that a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for intelligent action. The chapter \"Economic Reality\" has also been revised to reflect a change in emphasis in Simon's thinking about the respective roles of organizations and markets in economic systems."

The speech sounds varied along an acoustic dimension previously shown to cue phonemic distinctions among the voiced and voiceless stop consonants in adults. Discriminability was measured by an increase in conditioned response rate to a second speech sound after habituation to the first speech sound. Recovery from habituation was greater for a given acoustic difference when the two stimuli were from different adult phonemic categories than when they were from the same category. The discontinuity in discrimination at the region of the adult phonemic boundary was taken as evidence for categorical perception."

Let us briefly sketch some of the important aspects of the derivation. We assume there are a number of alternative responses, Ai, A2, \u2022 \u2022 -Ar, which can be made by the subject predicting, for example, which of several lights will turn on. The response is followed by an event\u2014EI, \u00a32, \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Er\u2014which is the actual turning on of one of the lights. Learning theory assumes that the actual event will change the future probability of predicting that event. Suppose the probability of a response, Aj, on the rath-trial is given by pnj. If an event, Ey, occurs, then the probability of Response Ay is increased. In early formulations of the learning rule, the correctness or incorrectness of a prediction determined the subsequent learning. However, it seems that only the occurrence of a particular event is required to increase the associated response probability. As Estes (1972) says in a review article, \"the mathematical operator applied on each trial is determined solely by the information received by the subject\" (p."

                "text": "AT a time when professional philosophers are trying to persuade us that philosophy is an attempt to answer questions which should never have been asked, and professional scientists are taking over the task of answering the questions, it is refreshing to come upon a writer on philosophy who, after a few preliminary skirmishes with the modern sceptics, unhesitatingly attacks a philosophical problem by the plain scientific method. Dr. Craik makes his philosophical point of view crystal clear. He believes in the methods of the observational scientists as the only methods of explanation. He is intolerant only of those who will not experiment and who consider that the virtue of thought is analytic precision rather than fruitfulness in the experimental field. He confesses that he has no gift for analytic precision and is particularly addicted to confusing similar concepts. He is, quite clearly, not deeply versed in traditional philosophy. This gives his book a certain freshness of outlook, although it makes his criticisms of the great philosophers, particularly Kant, appear rather na\u00efve.The Nature of ExplanationBy Dr. K. J. W.

The classic work of Fabre and those of Ferton (68), Adlerz (1), G. W. & E. G. Peckham (159), and P. & N. Rau (173) are widely known and have provided a broad founda\u00ad tion for the natural history of wasps. More recently, the influence of the \"European school\" of ethologists, exemplified particularly by Tinbergen and Baerends, has been strongly felt. In a sense, the modern era of wasp ethology may be said to have begun with Baerends' extended study of Ammophila pubescens Curtis in 1941 (5) and with Iwata's \"Comparative Studies on the Habits of Solitary Wasps\" in 1942 (88), for both of these papers have had an important impact on research in this field in the past 25 years. These two papers are accepted as points of departure for the present review; these and other papers cited below contain bibliographies which collectively cover much of the very extensive literature in this field. I have omitted mention of many strictly descriptive studies, not because these are unimportant as contributing to the comparative ethology of wasps, but simply because a very large volume would be needed to survey this field fully. Attention will here be directed to behavior patterns common to all solitary wasps (more especially to fossorial species) and to some of the important questions being asked about them by contemporary workers. I have omitted consideration of wasps parasitic upon other wasps, including both parasitoids (such as M utillidae) and cleptoparasites (c1epto\u00ad bionts, arbeitsparasiten) [such as Evagetes and Ceropales in the Pompilidae, Nysson and Stizoides in the Sphecidae (30, 37, 63, 73, 156, 220)]. Solitary wasps are defined as species in which there is no cooperation involving divis\u00ad ion of labor between mothers and daughters or between females of the same gener ation. All social wasps belong to a portion of the superfamily Vespoidea, to the family Vespidae as defined by Richards (177); he regards the social wasps as probably monophyletic, although this opinion has not been univer\u00ad sally accepted in the past. The nonparasitic solitary wasps considered here belong to seven families commonly placed in five superfamilies, as follows: Bethyloidea: Bethylidae; Scolioidea: Tiphiidae, Scoliidae; Vespoidea:"

Terms and phrases such as \"the global village\" and \"the medium is the message\" are now part of the lexicon, and McLuhan's theories continue to challenge our sensibilities and our assumptions about how and what we communicate. There has been a notable resurgence of interest in McLuhan's work in the last few years, fueled by the recent and continuing conjunctions between the cable companies and the regional phone companies, the appearance of magazines such as WiRed, and the development of new media models and information ecologies, many of which were spawned from MIT's Media Lab. In effect, media now begs to be redefined. In a new introduction to this edition of Understanding Media, Harper's editor Lewis Lapham reevaluates McLuhan's work in the light of the technological as well as the political and social changes that have occurred in the last part of this century."

The Standard view has been reiterated in a recent collection on animal rights, which casts Descartes as the villain of the piece for his alleged view that animals merely behave \u2018 as if they feel pain when they are, say, kicked or stabbed\u2019. The basis for this widely accepted interpretation is Descartes' famous doctrine of \u2018animal machine\u2019 (\u2018 bete-machine \u2019); a doctrine that one critic condemns as \u2018a grim fortaste of a mechanically minded age\u2019 which \u2018brutally violates the old kindly fellowship of living things\u2019."

He founded Zen Center in San Francisco and Zen Mountain Center in Tassajara, California, the first Soto monastery in the West. Suzuki Roshi had a quality of impeccable, spot1ess awareness. Any reader, whether familiar with Zen or not, can gain a luminous experience of this spotless awareness simply by reading a few pages of his talks to his students. The selection given here is on the right practice of zazen, or sitting meditation. It is a direct and lucid journey to the heart of actual practice, which is the beginning and conclusion of Zen."

T. de Mattos, of which the present work is an example in no way inferior, either in interest or in wealth of accurate observation, to the other volumes of the series. In it are recorded the results of a minute and careful study of the life-history of wasps belonging to the genera Eumenes, Odynerus, Pelopoeus, Agenia, and Vespa, related with the utmost simplicity and vividness, and illuminated by the lively and charming personality of the author.The Mason-Wasps.By J.

One form of the central learning assumptions of these models was first proposed by Hebb (1949) but, as is often the case in an active field of science, many of the fundamental assumptions of the models have been arrived at independently by different groups. In our development here, we will follow the notation and basic assumptions of Anderson (1968, 1970, 1972, 1977; Cooper, 1974). This version of a distributed, associative memory is formally exceptionally simple. It is easy to work with and may give a first approximation to some of the common properties of many distributed models. We start by making two central assumptions. First, nervous system activity can be most usefully represented as the set of simultaneous individual neuron activities in a group of neurons. Neuron \"activity\" is considered to be related to a continuous variable, the average firing frequency. Patterns of individual activities are stressed, because properties of particular neuron activities need not be related to each other for the system to function. Indeed, some evidence (Noda & Adey, 1970) indicates that interneuronal spike activity correlations of nearby cells recorded with the same electrode in parietal (\"association\") cortex may be quite low when the brain is doing \"interesting\" things. They found that in an animal in REM (rapid eye movement) sleep or in the awake, alert state, correlations were very low, whereas the same pairs of cells had highly correlated discharges in deep sleep. The same appears to be true in hippocampus (Noda, Manohar, & Adey, 1969). Recent work by Creutzfeldt, Innocenti, and Brooks (1974) seems to suggest that most cells in primary visual cortex, even those close to one another in the same cortical column, are not strongly coupled together, again implying a good deal of individuality of cell response. The individuality of cell responses in auditory cortex has been remarked upon (Goldstein, Hall, & Butterfield, 1968). Morrell, Hoeppner, and de Toledo (1976) studied single units in cat and rabbit parastriate cortex."

To proceed further, we must describe how the activity of a neuron reflects its synaptic inputs. For many cells, this can be extremely complex. However for some systems rather simple relations are found. We shall assume at first that neurons are simple linear analog integrators of their inputs, and we shall see what kinds of models evolve from this assumption. There is evidence supporting this assumption in a few well-studied systems. In the lateral inhibitory system of Limulus, rather good linear integration is found (Knight, Toyoda, & Dodge, 1970; Ratliff, Knight, Dodge, &Hartline, 1974). Linear transmission, according to Mountcastle (1967), holds for many mammalian sensory systems, once beyond an initial nonlinear transduction."
