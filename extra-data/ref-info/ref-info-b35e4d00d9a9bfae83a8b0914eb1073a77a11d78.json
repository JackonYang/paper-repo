However, studies in visual cognition show that humans use context to facilitate object detection in natural scenes by directing their attention or eyes to diagnostic regions. Here we propose a model of attention guidance based on global scene configuration. We show that the statistics of low-level features across the scene image determine where a specific object (e.g. a person) should be located. Human eye movements show that regions chosen by the top-down model agree with regions scrutinized by human observers performing a visual search task for people. The results validate the proposition that top-down information from visual context modulates the saliency of image regions during the task of object detection. Contextual information provides a shortcut for efficient object detection systems."

It is shown that the statistics of low-level features across the whole image can be used to prime the presence or absence of objects in the scene and to predict their location, scale, and appearance before exploring the image. In this scheme, visual context information can become available early in the visual processing chain, which allows modulation of the saliency of image regions and provides an efficient shortcut for object detection and recognition."

Here, we investigate the role of Contextual priors in guiding visual search by monitoring eye movements as participants search very familiar scenes for a target object. The goal of the study is to identify which stage of the visual search benefits from contextual priors. Two groups of participants differed in the expectation of target presence associated with a scene. Stronger priors are established when a scene exemplar is always associated with the presence of the target than when the scene is periodically observed with and without the target. In both cases, overall search performance improves over repeated presentations of scenes. An analytic decomposition of the time course of the effect of contextual priors shows a time benefit to the exploration stage of search (scan time) and a decrease in gaze duration on the target. The strength of the contextual relationship modulates the magnitude of gaze duration gain, while the scan time gain constitutes one half of the overall search performance benefit regardless of the probability (50% or 100%) of target presence. These data are discussed in terms of the implications of contextdependent scene processing and its putative role in various stages of visual search."

How does the human brain analyse and use these common associations? This article reviews the knowledge that is available, proposes specific mechanisms for the contextual facilitation of object recognition, and highlights important open questions. Although much has already been revealed about the cognitive and cortical mechanisms that subserve recognition of individual objects, surprisingly little is known about the neural underpinnings of contextual analysis and scene perception. Building on previous findings, we now have the means to address the question of how the brain integrates individual elements to construct the visual experience."

We contrasted the role of a scene's basic-level category membership with its specific arrangement of visual properties. Observers were repeatedly shown photographs of scenes that contained consistently but arbitrarily located targets, allowing target positions to be associated with scene content. Learned scenes were then unexpectedly mirror reversed, spatially translating visual features as well as the target across the display while preserving the scene's identity and concept. Mirror reversals produced a cost as the eyes initially moved toward the position in the display in which the target had previously appeared. The cost was not complete, however; when initial search failed, the eyes were quickly directed to the target's new position. These results suggest that in real-world scenes, shifts of attention are initially based on scene identity, and subsequent shifts are guided by more detailed information regarding scene and object layout."

This claim has provided a basis for challenging widely accepted data-driven models of visual perception in order to advocate alternative models with an outspoken top-down character. The present paper offers a review of the evidence to demonstrate that the observed scene-context effects may be the product of post-perceptual and task-dependent guessing strategies. A new research paradigm providing an on-line measure of genuine perceptual effects of context on object identification is proposed. First-fixation durations for objects incidentally fixated during the free exploration of real-world scenes are shown to increase when the objects are improbable in the scene or violate certain aspects of their typical spatial appearance in it. These effects of contextual violations are shown to emerge only at later stages of scene exploration, contrary to the notion of schema-driven scene perception effective from the very first scene fixation. In addition, evidence is reported in support of the existence of a facilitatory component in scene-context effects. This is taken to indicate that the context directly affects the ease of perceptual object processing and does not merely serve as a framework for checking the plausibility of the output of perceptual processes. Finally, our findings are situated against other contrasting results. Some future research questions are highlighted."

This study demonstrates that a robust memory for visual context exists to guide spatial attention. Global context was operationalized as the spatial layout of objects in visual search displays. Half of the configurations were repeated across blocks throughout the entire session, and targets appeared within consistent locations in these arrays. Targets appearing in learned configurations were detected more quickly. This newly discovered form of search facilitation is termed contextual cueing. Contextual cueing is driven by incidentally learned associations between spatial configurations (context) and target locations. This benefit was obtained despite chance performance for recognizing the configurations, suggesting that the memory for context was implicit. The results show how implicit learning and memory of visual context can guide spatial attention towards task-relevant aspects of a scene."

Chun and Jiang's (1998) \"contextual cueing\" effect shows that RTs are also speeded if the spatial configuration of items in a scene is repeated over time. In these studies we ask if global properties of the scene can speed search (e.g. if the display is mostly red, then the target is at location X). In Experiment 1a, the overall background color of the display predicted the target location. Here the predictive color could appear 0, 400 or 800 msec in advance of the search array. Mean RTs are faster in predictive than in non-predictive conditions. However, there is little improvement in search slopes. The global color cue did not improve search efficiency. Experiments 1b-1f replicate this effect using different predictive properties (e.g. background orientation/texture, stimuli color etc.). The results show a strong RT effect of predictive background but (at best) only a weak improvement in search efficiency. A strong improvement in efficiency was found, however, when the informative background was presented 1500 msec prior to the onset of the search stimuli and when observers were given explicit instructions to use the cue (Experiment 2)."

Controlling for target detectability and retinal eccentricity, we recorded observers' first saccades during search for objects that appeared in expected and unexpected locations within real scenes. As has been found with synthetic images and cues, accuracy of first saccades was significantly higher when the target appeared at an expected location rather than an unexpected location. Observers' saccades with target-absent images make it possible to distinguish two mechanisms that might mediate this effect: limited attentional resources versus differential weighting of information (Bayesian priors). Endpoints of first saccades in target-absent images were significantly closer to the expected than the unexpected locations, a result consistent with the differential-weighting model and inconsistent with limited resources being the sole mechanism underlying the effect."

                "text": "The nature of the information retained from previously fixated (and hence attended) objects in natural scenes was investigated. In a saccade-contingent change paradigm, participants successfully detected type and token changes (Experiment 1) or token and rotation changes (Experiment 2) to a target object when the object had been previously attended but was no longer within the focus of attention when the change occurred. In addition, participants demonstrated accurate type-, token-, and orientationdiscrimination performance on subsequent long-term memory tests (Experiments 1 and 2) and during online perceptual processing of a scene (Experiment 3). These data suggest that relatively detailed visual information is retained in memory from previously attended objects in natural scenes. A model of scene perception and long-term memory is proposed. Because of the size and complexity of the visual environments humans tend to inhabit, and because high-acuity vision is limited to a relatively small area of the visual field, detailed perceptual processing of a natural scene depends on the selection of local scene regions by movements of the eyes (for reviews, see Henderson & Hollingworth, 1998, 1999a). During scene viewing, the eyes are reoriented approximately three times each second by saccadic eye movements to bring the projection of a local scene region (typically a discrete object) onto the area of the retina producing the highest acuity vision (the fovea). The periods between saccades, when the eyes are relatively stationary and detailed visual information is encoded, are termed fixations and last an average of approximately 300 ms during scene viewing. During each brief saccadic eye movement, however, visual encoding is suppressed (Matin, 1974). Thus, the visual system is provided with what amounts to a series of snapshots (corresponding to fixations), which may vary dramatically in their visual content over a complex scene, punctuated by brief periods of blindness (corresponding to saccades)."

We investigated whether the visual context afforded by repeated exposure to real-world scenes can also guide attention when the relationship between the scene and a target position is arbitrary. Observers searched for and identified a target letter embedded in photographs of real-world scenes. Although search time within novel scenes was consistent across trials, search time within repeated scenes decreased across repetitions. Unlike previous demonstrations of contextual cueing, however, memory for scene-target covariation was explicit. In subsequent memory tests, observers recognized repeated contexts more often than those that were presented once and displayed superior recall of target position within the repeated scenes. In addition, repetition of inverted scenes, which made the scene more difficult to identify, produced a markedly reduced rate of learning, suggesting semantic information concerning object and scene identity are used to guide attention."

Contrary to this common belief, we report that subjects can rapidly detect animals or vehicles in briefly presented novel natural scenes while simultaneously performing another attentionally demanding task.

This ability to performvisual search has been the subject of a large body of research in the past 15 years. This paper reviews the visual search literature and presents a model of human search behavior. Built upon the work of Neisser, Treisman, Julesz, and others, the model distinguishes between a preattentive, massively parallel stage that processes information about basic visual features (color, motion, various depth cues, etc.) across large portions of the visual field and a subsequent limited-capacity stage that performs other, more complex operations (e.g., face recognition, reading, object identification) over a limited portion of the visual field. The spatial deployment of the limited-capacity process is under attentional control. The heart of the guided search model is the idea that attentional deployment of limited resources isguided by the output of the earlier parallel processes. Guided Search 2.0 (GS2) is a revision of the model in which virtually all aspects of the model have been made more explicit and/or revised in light of new data. The paper is organized into four parts: Part 1 presents the model and the details of its computer simulation. Part 2 reviews the visual search literature on preattentive processing of basic features and shows how the GS2 simulation reproduces those results. Part 3 reviews the literature on the attentional deployment of limited-capacity processes in conjunction and serial searches and shows how the simulation handles those conditions. Finally, Part 4 deals with shortcomings of the model and unresolved issues."

Chun and Jiang's (1998)contextual cuing effect shows that reaction times (RTs) are also speeded if the spatial configuration of items in a scene is repeated over time. In the present studies, we ask whether global properties of the scene can speed search (e.g., if the display is mostly red, then the target is at location X). In Experiment 1A, the overall background color of the display predicted the target location, and the predictive color could appear 0, 400, or 800 msec in advance of the search array. Mean RTs were faster in predictive than in nonpredictive conditions. However, there was little improvement in search slopes. The global color cue did not improve search efficiency. Experiments 1B-1F replicated this effect using different predictive properties (e.g., background orientation-texture and stimulus color). The results showed a strong RT effect of predictive background, but (at best) only a weak improvement in search efficiency. A strong improvement in efficiency was found, however, when the informative background was presented 1,500 msec prior to the onset of the search stimuli and when observers were given explicit instructions to use the cue (Experiment 2)."

The model is implemented in a neural network consisting of a hierarchy of spatial maps. Attentional gates control the flow of information from each level of the hierarchy to the next. The gates are jointly controlled by a Bottom-Up System favoring locations with unique features and a Top-Down System favoring locations with features designated as target features. Because the gating of each location depends on the features present there, the model is called FeatureGate."

This study addresses the question of how simple networks of neuron-like elements can account for a variety of phenomena associated with this shift of selective visual attention. Specifically, we propose the following: (1) A number of elementary features, such as color, orientation, direction of movement, disparity etc. are represented in parallel in different topographical maps, called the early representation. (2) There exists a selective mapping from the early topographic representation into a more central non-topographic representation, such that at any instant the central representation contains the properties of only a single location in the visual scene, the selected location. We suggest that this mapping is the principal expression of early selective visual attention. One function of selective attention is to fuse information from different maps into one coherent whole. (3) Certain selection rules determine which locations will be mapped into the central representation. The major rule, using the conspicuity of locations in the early representation, is implemented using a so-called Winner-Take-All network. Inhibiting the selected location in this network causes an automatic shift towards the next most conspicious location. Additional rules are proximity and similarity preferences. We discuss how these rules can be implemented in neuron-like networks and suggest a possible role for the extensive back-projection from the visual cortex to the LGN."

An initial and a modified scene image were displayed in alternation, separated by a blank interval (flicker paradigm). In the modified image, a single target object was changed either by deleting that object from the scene or by rotating that object 90\u00b0 in depth. In Experiment 1, fixation position at detection was more likely to be in the target object region than in any other region of the scene. In Experiment 2, participants detected scene changes more accurately, with fewer false alarms, and more quickly when allowed to move their eyes in the scene than when required to maintain central fixation. These data suggest a major role for fixation position in the detection of changes to natural scenes across discrete views."

In particular, a region in medial occipitotemporal cortex\u2014the \u201cparahippocampal place area\u201d, or PPA\u2014represents the geometric structure of scenes as defined primarily by their background elements. Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that the PPA responds preferentially to scenes but not to the objects within them, while neuropsychological studies have shown that damage to this region leads to an impaired ability to learn new scenes. More recent evidence suggests that the PPA encodes novel scenes in a viewpoint-specific manner and that these codes are more reliable in good navigators than bad navigators. The PPA may be part of a larger network of regions involved in processing navigationally relevant spatial information. The role of this region in place recognition and gist comprehension is also discussed."

But the environment also embodies structure in the form of redundancies and regularities that may serve to reduce complexity. How do perceivers internalize this complex informational structure? We present new evidence of visual learning that illustrates how observers learn how objects and events covary in the visual world. This information serves to guide visual processes such as object recognition and search. Our first experiment demonstrates that search and object recognition are facilitated by learned associations (covariation) between novel visual shapes. Our second experiment shows that regularities in dynamic visual environments can also be learned to guide search behavior. In both experiments, learning occurred incidentally and the memory representations were implicit. These experiments show how top-down visual knowledge, acquired through implicit learning, constrains what to expect and guides where to attend and look."

Koch, & P. Perona, 2002). Could this ability reflect detection of disjunctive feature sets rather than high-level binding? Participants detected an animal target in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) sequence and then reported its identity and location. They frequently failed to identify or to localize targets that they had correctly detected, suggesting that detection was based only on partial processing. Detection of targets was considerably worse in sequences that also contained humans, presumably because of shared features. When 2 targets were presented in RSVP, a prolonged attentional blink appeared that was almost eliminated when both targets were detected without being identified. The results suggest rapid feature analysis mediating detection, followed by attention-demanding binding for identification and localization."

Visual context can assist localization of individual objects via an implicit learning mechanism, as revealed in the contextual cueing paradigm (Chun & Jiang, 1998). What defines a visual context? How robust is contextual learning? And is it perceptually constrained? Here we investigate whether both local context that surround a target, and long-range context that does not spatially coincide with a target, can influence target localization. In the contextual cueing task, participants implicitly learned a context by repeated exposure to items arranged in invariant patterns. Experiments 1 and 2 suggest that only local context facilitates target localization. However, Experiment 3 showed that long range context can prime target location when target and context are not separated by random information. Experiment 4 showed that grouping by colour does not affect contextual cueing, suggesting that spatial features play a more important role than surface features in spatial contextual cueing. In separate analyses, visual hemifield differences were found for learning and performance. In sum, the results indicate that implicit learning of spatial context is robust across noise and biased towards spatially grouped information."

In Experiment 1, a scene and a modified version of that scene were presented in alternation, separated by a brief retention interval. A changed object was either semantically consistent with the scene (non-informative) or inconsistent (informative). Change detection latency was shorter in the semantically inconsistent versus consistent condition. In Experiment 2, eye movements were eliminated by presenting a single cycle of the change sequence. Detection accuracy was higher for inconsistent versus consistent objects. This inconsistent object advantage was obtained when the potential strategy of selectively encoding inconsistent objects was no longer advantageous (Experiment 3). These results indicate that the semantic properties of an object influence whether the representation of that object is maintained between views of a scene, and this influence is not caused solely by the differential allocation of eye fixations to the changing region. The potential cognitive mechanisms supporting this effect are discussed."

In the present experiments we used a paradigm in which an object in a scene is \"wiggled\"--drawing both attention and an eye fixation to itself--and then named. Thus the effect of scene context on object identification can be examined in a situation in which the target object is fixated and hence is fully visible. Experiment 1 indicated that a scene background that was episodically consistent with a target object facilitated the speed of naming. In Experiments 2 and 3, we investigated the time course of scene background information acquisition using display changes contingent on eye movements to the target object. The results from Experiment 2 were inconclusive; however, Experiment 3 demonstrated that scene background information present only on either the first or second fixation on a scene significantly affected naming time. Thus background information appears to be both extracted and able to affect object identification continuously during scene viewing."

In the first experiment, subjects were required to make a saccade to a specified location while also detecting a visual target presented just prior to the eye movement. Detection accuracy was highest when the location of the target coincided with the location of the saccade, suggesting that subjects use spatial attention in the programming and/or execution of saccadic eye movements. In the second experiment, subjects were explicitly directed to attend to a particular location and to make a saccade to the same location or to a different one. Superior target detection occurred at the saccade location regardless of attention instructions. This finding shows that subjects cannot move their eyes to one location and attend to a different one. The results of these experiments suggest that visuospatial attention is an important mechanism in generating voluntary saccadic eye movements."

In the present study, critical objects presented within color images of naturalistic scenes were changed during a saccade toward or away from the target. During the saccade, the critical object was changed to another object type, to a visually different token of the same object type, or was deleted from the scene. There were three main results. First, the deletion of a saccade target was special: Detection performance for saccade target deletions was very good, and this level of performance did not decline with the amplitude of the saccade. In contrast, detection of type and token changes at the saccade target, and of all changes including deletions at a location that had just been fixated but was not the saccade target, decreased as the amplitude of the saccade increased. Second, detection performance for type and token changes, both when the changing object was the target of the saccade and when the object had just been fixated but was not the saccade target, was well above chance. Third, mean gaze durations were reliably elevated for those trials in which the change was not overtly detected."

Despite instructions to memorize the details of the scenes and to monitor for object changes, viewers frequently failed to notice the changes. However, the failure to detect change was mediated by three other important factors: First, accuracy generally increased as the distance between the changing region and the fixation immediately before or after the change decreased. Second, changes were sometimes initially missed, but subsequently noticed when the changed region was later refixated. Third, when an object disappeared from a scene, detection of that disappearance was greatly improved when the deletion occurred during the saccade toward that object. These results suggest that fixation position and saccade direction play an important role in determining whether changes will be detected. It appears that more information can be retained across views than has been suggested by previous studies."

Indeed, this impression is so compelling that we tend to ascribe these properties not only to the external world, but to our internal representations as well. But results from several recent experiments argue against this latter ascription. For example, changes in images of real-world scenes often go unnoticed when made during a saccade, flicker, blink, or movie cut. This \u201cchange blindness\u201d provides strong evidence against the idea that our brains contain a picture-like representation of the scene that is everywhere detailed and coherent.\r\nHow then do we represent a scene? It is argued here that focused attention provides spatiotemporal coherence for the stable representation of one object at a time. It is then argued that the allocation of attention can be co-ordinated to create a \u201cvirtual representation\u201d. In such a scheme, a stable object representation is formed whenever needed, making it appear to higher levels as if all objects in the scene are represented in detail simultaneously."

We propose how scene categorization could be computed in a feedforward manner in order to provide top-down and contextual information very early in the visual processing chain. Results show how visual categorization based directly on low-level features, without grouping or segmentation stages, can benefit object localization and identification. We show how simple image statistics can be used to predict the presence and absence of objects in the scene before exploring the image."

The procedure is based on a very low dimensional representation of the scene, that we term the Spatial Envelope. We propose a set of perceptual dimensions (naturalness, openness, roughness, expansion, ruggedness) that represent the dominant spatial structure of a scene. Then, we show that these dimensions may be reliably estimated using spectral and coarsely localized information. The model generates a multidimensional space in which scenes sharing membership in semantic categories (e.g., streets, highways, coasts) are projected closed together. The performance of the spatial envelope model shows that specific information about object shape or identity is not a requirement for scene categorization and that modeling a holistic representation of the scene informs about its probable semantic category."

However, when brief blank fields are placed between alternating displays of an original and a modified scene, a striking failure of perception is induced: Identification of changes becomes extremely difficult, even when changes are large and made repeatedly. Identification is much faster when a verbal cue is provided, showing that poor visibility is not the cause of this difficulty. Identification is also faster for objects considered to be important in the scene. These results support the idea that observers never form a complete, detailed representation of their surroundings. In addition, the results indicate that attention is required to perceive change, and that in the absence of localized motion signals, attention is guided on the basis of high-level interest."

In panoramic search, observers see part of an unchanging scene larger than their current field of view. A target object can be visible, present in the display but hidden from view, or absent. Visual search efficiency does not change after hundreds of trials through an unchanging scene (Experiment 1). Memory search, in contrast, begins inefficiently but becomes efficient with practice. Given a choice between vision and memory, observers choose vision (Experiments 2 and 3). However, if forced to use their memory on some trials, they learn to use memory on all trials, even when reliable visual information remains available (Experiment 4). The results suggest that observers make a pragmatic choice between vision and memory, with a strong bias toward visual search even for memorized stimuli."

However, the specific function of each of these regions is not yet clear. Here we present evidence that a particular area within human parahippocampal cortex is involved in a critical component of navigation: perceiving the local visual environment. This region, which we name the \u2018parahippocampal place area\u2019 (PPA), responds selectively and automatically in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to passively viewed scenes, but only weakly to single objects and not at all to faces. The critical factor for this activation appears to be the presence in the stimulus of information about the layout of local space. The response in the PPA to scenes with spatial layout but no discrete objects (empty rooms) is as strong as the response to complex meaningful scenes containing multiple objects (the same rooms furnished) and over twice as strong as the response to arrays of multiple objects without three-dimensional spatial context (the furniture from these rooms on a blank background). This response is reduced if the surfaces in the scene are rearranged so that they no longer define a coherent space. We propose that the PPA represents places by encoding the geometry of the local environment."

Subjects looked at arrays of four objects while their eye movements were recorded. Their task was to identify the objects in the array for an immediate probe memory test. During viewing, the number and location of objects visible during given fixations were manipulated. In Experiments 1 and 2, we found that multiple extrafoveal previews of an object did not afford any more benefit than a single extrafoveal preview, as assessed by means of time of fixation on the objects. In Experiment 3, we found evidence for a model in which extrafoveal information acquired during a fixation derives primarily from the location toward which the eyes will move next. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for the relationship between covert visual attention and extrafoveal information use, and a sequential attention model is proposed."

The first stages use simple local features, and the image is subsequently represented in terms of larger and more complex features. These include features of intermediate complexity and partial object views. The nature and use of these higher-order representations remains an open question in the study of visual processing by the primate cortex. Here we show that intermediate complexity (IC) features are optimal for the basic visual task of classification. Moderately complex features are more informative for classification than very simple or very complex ones, and so they emerge naturally by the simple coding principle of information maximization with respect to a class of images. Our findings suggest a specific role for IC features in visual processing and a principle for their extraction."

Scenes were presented in one of three forms: Diagnostically coloured, nondiagnostically coloured, or greyscale images. In a verification task, observers were instructed to respond whenever the presented stimulus matched a previously presented category name.

Specifically we seek to understand the structure of color cues that allows the express recognition of scene gists. Using the L*a*b* color space we examined the conditions under which chromatic cues concur with brightness to allow a viewer to recognize scenes at a glance. Using different methods, Experiments 1 and 2 tested the hypothesis that colors do contribute when they are diagnostic (i.e., predictive) of a scene category. Experiment 3 examined the structure of colored cues at different spatial scales that are responsible for the effects of color diagnosticity reported in Experiments 1 and 2. Together, the results suggest that colored blobs at a coarse spatial scale concur with luminance cues to form the relevant spatial layout that mediates express scene recognition."

In this paper we develop a new technique (based on Bubbles, Gosselin & Schyns, 2001a; Schyns, Bonnar, & Gosselin, 2002) to determine some of the information requirements of basic-level scene categorizations. Using 2400 scenes from an established scene database (Oliva & Torralba, 2001), the algorithm randomly samples the Fourier coefficients of the phase spectrum. Sampled Fourier coefficients retain their original phase while the phase of nonsampled coefficients is replaced with that of white noise. Observers categorized the stimuli into 8 basic-level categories. The location of the sampled Fourier coefficients leading to correct categorizations was recorded per trial. Statistical analyses revealed the major scales and orientations of the phase spectrum that observers used to distinguish scene categories."

The interpretation of shading, edges, and junctions may provide a 3D model of the scene but it will not provide information about the actual \"scale\" of the space. One possible source of information for absolute depth estimation is the image size of known objects. However, object recognition, under unconstrained conditions, remains difficult and unreliable for current computational approaches. We propose a source of information for absolute depth estimation based on the whole scene structure that does not rely on specific objects. We demonstrate that, by recognizing the properties of the structures present in the image, we can infer the scale of the scene and, therefore, its absolute mean depth. We illustrate the interest in computing the mean depth of the scene with application to scene recognition and object detection."

These issues bear on the more general question of the degree of independence between the saccadic and attentional movement systems. The results of these experiments support the contention that the mechanisms that shift attention are separate from those that control saccadic eye movements. Relevant events in the visual field periphery, however, will trigger both a saccade and attention shift. The attentional response to such events does not appear to be under subjects' control. The implication of these results for theories of saccadic suppression is discussed."

                "text": "Efficient categorizations of complex visual stimuli require effective encodings of their distinctive properties. However, the question remains of how processes of object and scene categorization use the information associated with different perceptual spatial scales. The psychophysics of scale perception suggests that recognition uses coarse blobs before fine scale edges, because the former is perceptually available before the latter. Although possible, this perceptually determined scenario neglects the nature of the task the recognition system must solve. If different spatial scales transmit different information about the input, an identical scene might be flexibly encoded and perceived at the scale that optimizes information for the considered task-i.e., the diagnostic scale. This paper tests the hypothesis that scale diagnosticity can determine scale selection for recognition. Experiment 1 tested whether coarse and fine spatial scales were both available at the onset of scene categorization. The second experiment tested that the selection of one scale could change depending on the diagnostic information present at this scale. The third and fourth experiments investigated whether scale-specific cues were independently processed, or whether they perceptually cooperated in the recognition of the input scene. Results suggest that a mandatory low-level registration of multiple spatial scales promotes flexible scene encodings, perceptions, and categorizations."

It has also been shown that the hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus mediate the integration of objects with background scenes in functional imaging studies, but only when encoding or retrieval processes have been directed toward the relevant stimuli. Using functional magnetic resonance adaptation, we demonstrated that object, background scene, and contextual integration of selectively repeated objects and background scenes could be dissociated during the passive viewing of naturalistic pictures involving object-scene pairings. Specifically, bilateral fusiform areas showed adaptation to object repetition, regardless of whether the associated scene was novel or repeated, suggesting sensitivity to object processing. Bilateral parahippocampal regions showed adaptation to background scene repetition, regardless of whether the focal object was novel or repeated, suggesting selectivity for background scene processing. Finally, bilateral parahippocampal regions distinct from those involved in scene processing and the right hippocampus showed adaptation only when the unique pairing of object with background scene was repeated, suggesting that these regions perform binding operations."

To exploit both local image data as well as contextual information, we introduce Boosted Random Fields (BRFs), which uses Boosting to learn the graph structure and local evidence of a conditional random field (CRF). The graph structure is learned by assembling graph fragments in an additive model. The connections between individual pixels are not very informative, but by using dense graphs, we can pool information from large regions of the image; dense models also support efficient inference. We show how contextual information from other objects can improve detection performance, both in terms of accuracy and speed, by using a computational cascade. We apply our system to detect stuff and things in office and street scenes."

Greene (mrgreene@mit.edu) Aude Oliva (oliva@mit.edu) Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cambridge, MA 02139 visual processing, enabling the rapid estimation of scene gist. The behavioral and modeling experiments we propose here are meant to establish the psychological foundation of a scene-centered approach to scene understanding. Beyond the principle of recognizing the \u201cforest before the trees\u201d (Navon, 1977), we propose an operational definition of the global scene properties permitting the categorization of a scene as a \u201cforest\u201d. Faithful to a scene-centered representation which will capture the completeness of the gist of a scene, our selection of a vocabulary of global scene properties was influenced by the requirement to describe structural, functional and surface-based features of an environmental scene. Namely, which properties of a space allow the description of its semantic category, function and affordance? Previous research has shown that global properties of mean depth, openness and expansion describe the spatial layout of a scene well enough to be predictive of its probable semantic category (Oliva & Torralba, 2001). Properties of navigability and camouflage reflect the functionality of the space and the type of actions that can be afforded in outdoor natural scenes. Movement (i.e. the transience of the elements in the scene) and temperature are relevant surface-based properties that influence human\u2019s behavior, and refer to the material and texture qualities of image regions (i.e. rocky and sandy often imply hot and non-moving, while snow implies cold and rushing water implies movement). These properties have been shown in previous work to be available for report with less exposure time than the semantic category of an image (Greene & Oliva, 2005). The seven global properties we describe here are ecological in the sense that they are descriptive of the types of interactions a human could have in an outdoor natural landscape (e.g. can walk through without worry of occluding objects), or are descriptive of the space of a scene (e.g a panoramic environment), which can in turn, guide behavior. It is of note that such a scene-centered representation has no explicit declaration of objects or region segmentation. Outdoor scenes have few objects that can be manipulated and interacted with by a human (e.g. a rock, a flower), but their size is almost entirely local and therefore not captured by global properties. Our principal hypothesis is that the initial image representation that facilitates semantic scene categorization can be built from the conjunctive detection of ecological Abstract Human scene understanding is remarkable: with only a brief glance at an image, an abundance of information is available - spatial layout, scene function, semantic label, etc. Here we propose a scene-centered model of rapid human scene understanding that uses a vocabulary of global, ecological scene properties that combine to categorize natural landscape images. Behaviorally, we show human observers are sensitive to the underlying distributions of these global properties for use in basic-level categorization. An ideal observer trained only on the distributions of these properties predicts human scene categorization performance (r=0.90) and human errors. Introduction Human scene understanding is truly remarkable: with the briefest of glimpses at an image, we instantaneously understand its content and meaning (Potter, 1975; Thorpe et al., 1996). Even more striking is the richness of the variety of information perceived within a glance: a few objects, spatial layout, functional and conceptual properties and even emotional valence (Maljkovic and Martini, 2005) are all available with well under 100 msec of exposure to a novel image. The entirety of this information is termed a scene\u2019s gist (Oliva, 2005). What is the nature of the representation that mediates rapid scene categorization? To the contrary of the traditional ideas of research in scene understanding that treat objects as the atoms of recognition, we consider that real world scenes can be recognized without necessarily identifying the objects they contain (Biederman et al, 1982; Greene and Oliva, 2005; Schyns & Oliva, 1994; Oliva & Schyns, 2000). This scene- centered approach to recognition emphasizes properties describing the structure and the meaning of the whole scene independent of object analysis. Recent computational models of scene recognition have shown indeed that a variety of low level features (color, texture) and spatial layout properties (e.g. its level of openness, perspective) are correlated with the semantic category of environmental scenes at both superordinate and basic level of representation (Fei Fei & Perona, 2005; Oliva & Torralba, 2001; Walker-Renninger and Malik, 2001; Torralba & Oliva, 2003; Vogel & Schiele, 2004). A scene-centered schema would not preclude local object recognition, but would serve as a feed-forward and parallel pathway of"

The extent of change blindness in visual perception suggests limits on our capacity to encode, retain, and compare visual information from one glance to the next; our awareness of our visual surroundings is far more sparse than most people intuitively believe. These failures of awareness and the erroneous intuitions that often accompany them have both theoretical and practical ramifications. This article briefly summarizes the current state of research on change blindness and suggests future directions that promise to improve our understanding of scene perception and visual memory."

The model is based on a set of parts which describe the expected appearance and position, in an object centered coordinate frame, of features detected by a low-level interest operator. Each object category then has its own distribution over these parts, which are shared between objects. We learn the parameters of this model via a Gibbs sampler which uses the graphical model's structure to analytically average over many parameters. Applied to a database of images of isolated objects, the sharing of parts among objects improves detection accuracy when few training examples are available. We also extend this hierarchical framework to scenes containing multiple objects"

The major emphasis of the review is on reading as a specific example of cognitive processing. Basic topics discussed with respect to reading are (a) the characteristics of eye movements, (b) the perceptual span, (c) integration of information across saccades, (d) eye movement control, and (e) individual differences (including dyslexia). Similar topics are discussed with respect to the other tasks examined. The basic theme of the review is that eye movement data reflect moment-to-moment cognitive processes in the various tasks examined. Theoretical and practical considerations concerning the use of eye movement data are also discussed."

Using a go/no-go paradigm sensitive to fast recognition processes, we measured early event-related potential (ERP) correlates of scene categorization to elucidate the processing stage at which colour contributes to scene recognition. Observers were presented with scenes belonging to four colour-diagnostic categories (desert, forest, canyon and coastline). Scenes were presented in one of three forms: Diagnostically coloured, nondiagnostically coloured, or greyscale images. In a verification task, observers were instructed to respond whenever the presented stimulus matched a previously presented category name. Reaction times and accuracy were optimal when the stimuli were presented as their original diagnostically coloured version, followed by their greyscale version, and lastly by their nondiagostically coloured version. These effects were mirrored in the early (i.e., 150 ms following stimulus onset) ERP frontal correlates. Their onset was delayed for greyscale scenes compared to diagnostically coloured scenes, and for nondiagnostically coloured scenes compared to the other two conditions. Frontal ERP amplitudes also decreased for greyscale and nondiagnostically coloured scenes. Together, the results suggest that diagnostic colours are part of the scene gist responsible for express scene categorization."

Each element of this set is a complex feature obtained by combining position- and scale-tolerant edge-detectors over neighboring positions and multiple orientations. Our system's architecture is motivated by a quantitative model of visual cortex. We show that our approach exhibits excellent recognition performance and outperforms several state-of-the-art systems on a variety of image datasets including many different object categories. We also demonstrate that our system is able to learn from very few examples. The performance of the approach constitutes a suggestive plausibility proof for a class of feedforward models of object recognition in cortex."

The effects of consistency on perception were investigated using manipulated photographs containing a foreground object that was either semantically consistent or inconsistent with its setting. In four experiments, participants reported the foreground object, the setting, or both after seeing each picture for 80 ms followed by a mask. In Experiment 1, objects were identified more accurately in a consistent than an inconsistent setting. In Experiment 2, backgrounds were identified more accurately when they contained a consistent rather than an inconsistent foreground object. In Experiment 3, objects were presented without backgrounds and backgrounds without objects; comparison with the other experiments indicated that objects were identified better in isolation than when presented with a background, but there was no difference in accuracy for backgrounds whether they appeared with a foreground object or not. Finally, in Experiment 4, consistency effects remained when both objects and backgrounds were reported. Semantic consistency information is available when a scene is glimpsed briefly and affects both object and background perception. Objects and their settings are processed interactively and not in isolation."

For example, when several grating patches are viewed parafoveally, observers are unable to report the orientation of the central patch. This phenomenon, known as 'crowding,' has historically been confused with lateral masking, in which one stimulus attenuates signals generated by another stimulus. Here we show that despite their inability to report the orientation of an individual patch, observers can reliably estimate the average orientation, demonstrating that the local orientation signals are combined rather than lost. Our results imply that crowding is distinct from ordinary masking, and is perhaps related to texture perception. Under crowded conditions, the orientation signals in primary visual cortex are pooled before they reach consciousness."

In Experiment 1, human subjects performed 4 go/no-go categorization tasks in succession with colour pictures of real-world scenes belonging to 2 natural categories: \u201cSea\u201d and \u201cmountain\u201d, and 2 artificial categories: \u201cIndoor\u201d and \u201curban\u201d. Experiment 2 used colour and grey-level scenes in the same tasks to assess the role of colour cues on performance. Pictures were flashed for 26 ms. Both experiments showed that the gist of real-world scenes can be extracted with high accuracy (>90%), short median RT (400-460 ms) and early responses triggered with latencies as short as 260-300 ms. Natural scenes were processed faster than artificial scenes. Categories for which colour could have a diagnostic value were processed faster in colour than in grey. Finally, processing speed is compared for scene and object categorization tasks."

This issue is important for understanding visual cortical function as it places constraints on models of the information processing underlying recognition. We designed a series of event-related potential (ERP) experiments to measure the timecourse of electrophysiological correlates of object recognition. We find two distinct types of components in the ERP recorded during categorization of natural images. One is an early presentation-locked signal arising around 135 ms that is present when there are low-level feature differences between images. The other is a later, recognition-related component arising between 150-300 ms. Unlike the early component, the latency of the later component covaries with the subsequent reaction time. In contrast to previous studies suggesting that the early, presentation-locked component of neural activity is correlated to recognition, these results imply that the neural signatures of recognition have a substantially later and variable time of onset."

One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding7\u201312. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties13\u201318, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal8,12 that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs."

                "text": "Recent experimental work has shown that the primate visual system can analyze complex natural scenes in only 100-150 ms. Such data, when combined with anatomical and physiological knowledge, seriously constrains current models of visual processing. In particular, it suggests that a lot of processing can be achieved using a single feed-forward pass through the visual system, and that each processing layer probably has no more than around 10 ms before the next stage has to respond. In this time, few neurons will have generated more than one spike, ruling out most conventional rate coding models. We have been exploring the possibility of using the fact that strongly activated neurons tend to fire early and that information can be encoded in the order in which a population of cells fire. These ideas have been tested using SpikeNet, a computer program that simulates the activity of very large networks of asynchronously firing neurons. The results have been extremely promising, and we have been able to develop artificial visual systems capable of processing complex natural scenes in real time using standard computer hardware (see http://www.spikenet-technology.com)."

Set size was varied and reaction times (RT) were measured. For many unpracticed subjects, the slopes of the resulting RT X Set Size functions are too shallow to be consistent with Treisman's feature integration model, which proposes serial, self-terminating search for conjunctions. Searches for triple conjunctions (Color X Size X Form) are easier than searches for standard conjunctions and can be independent of set size. A guided search model similar to Hoffman's (1979) two-stage model can account for these data. In the model, parallel processes use information about simple features to guide attention in the search for conjunctions. Triple conjunctions are found more efficiently than standard conjunctions because three parallel processes can guide attention more effectively than two."

To explore this question, we used an artificial moving scotoma paradigm to eliminate a region of a currently viewed display in real time as a function of eye position. Subjects examined linear arrays of four line drawings of objects while their eye movements were recorded. Immediately following each array, a test probe was presented to test the degree to which the subject had identified those objects. Three conditions were compared, one in which a central foveal scotoma was created, one in which an extrafoveal scotoma was created, and a control condition in which the scotoma was absent. The main result was that identification accuracy was very good, but eye-movement behavior was disrupted when a foveal scotoma was present. These results suggest that foveal information is not necessary but is beneficial for perceptual encoding during object identification; the loss of foveal information can be overcome as long as compensatory extrafoveal processing is possible."

Our work is motivated by the continuing effort in content-based image retrieval to extract and to model the semantic content of images. The basic idea of the semantic modeling is to classify local image regions into semantic concept classes such as water, rocks, or foliage. Images are represented through the frequency of occurrence of these local concepts. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the image representation is well suited for modeling the semantic content of heterogenous scene categories, and thus for categorization and retrieval.The image representation also allows us to rank natural scenes according to their semantic similarity relative to certain scene categories. Based on human ranking data, we learn a perceptually plausible distance measure that leads to a high correlation between the human and the automatically obtained typicality ranking. This result is especially valuable for content-based image retrieval where the goal is to present retrieval results in descending semantic similarity from the query."

In Experiment 1, subjects were trained on 36 visual search displays that contained 36 sets of distractor locations and 18 target locations. Each target location was paired with two sets of distractor locations on separate trials. After training, the subjects showed perfect transfer to recombined displays, which were created by combining half of one trained distractor set with half of another trained distractor set. This result suggests that individual distractor locations were sufficient to cue the target location. In Experiment 2, the subjects showed good transfer from trained displays to rescaled, displaced, and perceptually regrouped displays, suggesting that the relative locations among items were also learned. Thus, both individual target-distractor associations and configural associations are learned in contextual cuing."

The critical comparison was between repeated search in which the same set of stimuli remained present in fixed positions in the display for many (>100) trials and unrepeated conditions in which new stimuli were presented on each trial. In repeated search conditions, observers monitored an essentially stable display for the disruption of a clearly visible object. This is an extension of repeated search experiments in which subjects search a fixed set of items for different targets on each trial (Wolfe, Klempen, & Dahlen, 2000) and can be considered as a form of a \"change blindness\" task. The unrepeated search was very inefficient, showing that a scrambled object does not \"pop-out\" among intact objects (or vice versa). Interestingly, the repeated search condition was just as inefficient, as if participants had to search for the scrambled target even after extensive experience with the specific change in the specific scene. The results suggest that the attentional processes involved in searching for a target in a novel scene may be very similar to those used to confirm the presence of a target in a familiar scene."

The second approach, however, enables systematic analysis of the influence of various environments and test situations on behavior of the species. The existence of interactions between variables does not imply that general statements cannot be made about genetic , age, or environmental factors per se. Significant main effects may still be the primary concern of the investigator and may frequently emerge. The value of such results increases considerably, however, if it is known that the effect occurs over a wide range of conditions and if the investigator is aware of specific interactions. How is symbolic information retrieved from recent memory? The study of short-term memory (1) has revealed some of the determinants of failures to remember, but has provided little insight into error-free performance and the retrieval processes that underlie it. One reason for the neglect of retrieval mechanisms may be the implicit assumption that a short time after several items have been memorized, they can be immediately and simultaneously available for expression in recall or in other responses, rather than having to be retrieved first. In another vocabulary (2), this is to assume the equivalence of the \"span of immediate mem-ory\" (the number of items that can be recalled without error) and the \"mo-mentary capacity of consciousness\" (the number of items immediately available). The experiments reported here (3) show that the assumption is unwarranted. Underlying the paradigm of these experiments is the supposition that if the selection of a response requires the use of information that is in memory, the latency of the response will reveal something about the process by which 652 References and Notes 1. 6. A longer, more detailed paper describing the complete study, including diallel cross and correlation analyses and a discussion of specific gamete, treatment, and sex effects is in preparation. Among previously undisturbed mice, mode of inheritance interacts with sex, and dominance appears within sexes. This finding is consist-ant with the results of J. H. Bruell: \"Mode of inheritance of emotional defecation in mice,\" unpublished. E the information is retrieved. Of particular interest in the study of retrieval is the effect of the number of elements in memory on the response latency. The subject first memorizes a short series of symbols. He is then shown a test stimulus, and is required to decide whether or not it \u2026"

The authors investigated the pictorial and conceptual components of this fleeting memory by presenting 5 pictured scenes and immediately testing recognition of verbal titles (e.g., people at a table) or recognition of the pictures themselves. Recognition declined during testing, but initial performance was higher and the decline steeper when pictures were tested. A final experiment included test decoy pictures that were conceptually similar to but visually distinct from the original pictures. Yeses to decoys were higher than yeses to other distractors. Fleeting memory for glimpsed pictures has a strong conceptual component (conceptual short-term memory), but there is additional highly volatile pictorial memory (pictorial short-term memory) that is not tapped hy a gist title or decoy picture."

In two experiments, sequences of 16 color photographs were presented at rates of 113, 167, or 333 msec per picture. In one group, subjects were given an immediate test of recognition memory for the pictures and in other groups they searched for a target picture. Even when the target had only been specified by a title (e.g., a boat) detection of a target was strikingly superior to recognition memory. Detection was slightly but significantly better for pictured than named targets. In a third experiment pictures were presented for 50, 70, 90 or 120 msec preceded and followed by a visual mask; at 120 msec recognition memory was as accurate as detection had been. The results, taken together with those in 1969 of Potter and Levy for slower rates of sequential presentation, suggest that on the average a scene is understood and so becomes immune to ordinary visual masking within about 100 msec but requires about 300 msec of further processing before the memory representation is resistant to conceptual masking from a following picture. Possible functions of a short-term conceptual memory, such as the control of eye fixations, are discussed."

Each item in the set may be distinct, highly visible, and discriminable. But when we look away from the set, what information do we have? The current article starts to address this question by introducing the idea of a set representation. This idea was tested using two new paradigms: mean discrimination and member identification. Three experiments using sets of different-sized spots showed that observers know a set's mean quite accurately but know little about the individual items, except their range. Taken together, these results suggest that the visual system represents the overall statistical, and not individual, properties of sets."

Such data is useful for supervised learning and quantitative evaluation. To achieve this, we developed a web-based tool that allows easy image annotation and instant sharing of such annotations. Using this annotation tool, we have collected a large dataset that spans many object categories, often containing multiple instances over a wide variety of images. We quantify the contents of the dataset and compare against existing state of the art datasets used for object recognition and detection. Also, we show how to extend the dataset to automatically enhance object labels with WordNet, discover object parts, recover a depth ordering of objects in a scene, and increase the number of labels using minimal user supervision and images from the web.\n"

Traditional approaches require applying a battery of different classifiers to the image, which can be slow and require much training data. We present a multi-class boosting procedure (joint boosting) that reduces both the computational and sample complexity, by finding common features that can be shared across the classes. The detectors for each class are trained jointly, rather than independently. For a given performance level, the total number of features required is observed to scale approximately logarithmically with the number of classes. In addition, we find that the features selected by independently trained classifiers are often specific to the class, whereas the features selected by the jointly trained classifiers are more generic features, such as lines and edges."

We present a new image representation that provides a transformation from the raw pixel data to a small set of image regions that are coherent in color and texture. This \"Blobworld\" representation is created by clustering pixels in a joint color-texture-position feature space. The segmentation algorithm is fully automatic and has been run on a collection of 10,000 natural images. We describe a system that uses the Blobworld representation to retrieve images from this collection. An important aspect of the system is that the user is allowed to view the internal representation of the submitted image and the query results. Similar systems do not offer the user this view into the workings of the system; consequently, query results from these systems can be inexplicable, despite the availability of knobs for adjusting the similarity metrics. By finding image regions that roughly correspond to objects, we allow querying at the level of objects rather than global image properties. We present results indicating that querying for images using Blobworld produces higher precision than does querying using color and texture histograms of the entire image in cases where the image contains distinctive objects."

The model is parameterized by a set of statistics computed on pairs of coefficients corresponding to basis functions at adjacent spatial locations, orientations, and scales. We develop an efficient algorithm for synthesizing random images subject to these constraints, by iteratively projecting onto the set of images satisfying each constraint, and we use this to test the perceptual validity of the model. In particular, we demonstrate the necessity of subgroups of the parameter set by showing examples of texture synthesis that fail when those parameters are removed from the set. We also demonstrate the power of our model by successfully synthesizing examples drawn from a diverse collection of artificial and natural textures."

The present studies investigated the possibility that assessment of confidence is biased by attempts to justify one's chosen answer. These attempts include selectively focusing on evidence supporting the chosen answer and disregarding evidence contradicting it. Experiment 1 presented subjects with two-alternative questions and required them to list reasons for and against each of the alternatives prior to choosing an answer and assessing the probability of its being correct. This procedure produced a marked improvement in the appropriateness of confidence judgments. Experiment 2 simplified the manipulation by asking subjects first to choose an answer and then to list (a) one reason supporting that choice, (b) one reason contradicting it, or (c) one reason supporting and one reason contradicting. Only the listing of contradicting reasons improved the appropriateness of confidence. Correlational analyses of the data of Experiment 1 strongly suggested that the confidence depends on the amount and strength of the evidence supporting the answer chosen."
