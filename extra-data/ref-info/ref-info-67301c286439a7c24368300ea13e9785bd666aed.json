This correspondence describes a program that demonstrates the feasibility of segmenting a scene into regions on the basis of velocity. A velocity measure is obtained by determining the amount of displacement of a reference feature between two pictures of the same scene. The pictures are taken only a short time apart so that the reference features can be correlated between the pictures on the basis of spatial position alone. This velocity measurement is associated with absolute reference points superimposed over the scene. It is assumed that all parts of an object have the same velocity measurement. Thus the velocity measurements associated with the reference points provide a means of classifying them as ``belonging'' to the same object. Points ``inside'' moving objects fall into either of two velocity measurement classes, which are easily correlated. Since the velocity of an object is independent of its color, a scene is segmented into regions that contain complete objects even if the objects are not monochromatic."

Study of the model reveals a number of fundamental relations that form the basis for an analysis program. In particular, a systematic anaylsis is given of the topological changes that can occur when overlapping figures move together or apart.

A class of algorithms, which may be used to determine similarity in a far more efficient manner than methods currently in use, is introduced in this paper. There may be a saving of computation time of two orders of magnitude or more by adopting this new approach. The problem of translational image registration, used for an example throughout, is discussed and the problems with the most widely used method-correlation explained. Simple implementations of the new algorithms are introduced to motivate the basic idea of their structure. Real data from ITOS-1 satellites are presented to give meaningful empirical justification for theoretical predictions."
