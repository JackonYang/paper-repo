In this paper, we examine the utility of exploiting information other than the key words in a digital document to provide the users with more flexible and powerful query capabilities. More specifically, we exploit the structural information in a document to identify tables and their component fields and let the users query based on these fields. Our empirical results have demonstrated that heuristic method based table extraction and component tagging can be performed effectively and efficiently. Moreover, our experiments in retrieval using the TINTIN system have strongly indicated that such structural decomposition can facilitate better representation of user\u2019s information needs and hence more effective retrieval of tables."

These baseline results suggest that very simple string-based cohesion measures are not sufficient to support the extraction of tuples as we require.

However, these approaches are applicable to only the same kind of documents because they are based on the paradigm that specifies the structure definition information in advance so as to be able to analyze a particular class of documents intelligently. In this paper, the authors propose a method to recognize the layout structures of multi-kinds of table-form document images. For this purpose, the authors introduce a classification tree to manage the relationships among different classes of layout structures. The authors' recognition system has two modes: layout knowledge acquisition and layout structure recognition. In the layout knowledge acquisition mode, table-form document images are distinguished according to this. Classification tree and then the structure description trees which specify the logical structures of table-form documents are generated automatically. While, in the layout structure recognition mode, individual item fields in the table-form document images are extracted and classified successfully by searching the classification tree and interpreting the structure description tree. >"

This approach is unsuitable for detecting short segments because terms tend not to be repeated across just a few sentences. We investigate the contribution of two other lexical features to find related words: collocation and relation weights (which identify semantic relations). An experiment was conducted on a set of test data with known topic changes; the performances of the three features were independently compared. A combination of all features was the most reliable indicator of a topic change. In another experiment, CNN news summaries were segmented into their individual news stories. Precision and recall rates of around 90% are reported for news story boundary detection."

First, the document is decomposed into a set of boxes and they are classified semi-automatically into four types: blank, insertion, indication and explanation. Then the box relations between the indication box and its associated entry one are analyzed based on the semantic and geometric knowledge defined in the document structure grammar. Finally, the system generates LATEX codes of the synthesized documents whose blank and insertion boxes are filled with the text and image data given by user. Experimental results have shown that the system analyzed successfully several kinds of table forms and yielded synthesized documents as expected."

                "text": "The eld of handwriting recognition is divided into two distinctive areas: o -line recognition and on-line recognition. A typical example of o -line recognition is postal mail sorting where addresses on envelopes are automatically scanned, processed in an OCR-system, and, according to the recognition results, mechanically routed to the appropriate sorting bins. O -line recognition rates vary with the size of the lexicon, the country, etc. However, it can be said that the state of the art for writer independent recognition is around 95% for lexica of American city names containing a few hundred words. The redundancy between names and zip codes is used to improve recognition rates. In general, the recognition rates of machine printed addresses are higher than the recognition rates of handwritten addresses. A typical example of on-line recognition are Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs). These are small handheld computers accepting pen-based input and combining agenda, address book and telecommunication facilities. On-line recognition methods exploit dynamic information such as the position of the pen at a given time, the velocity of the pen, or the pressure on the writing surface. They require hardware that can record the data of a written text during writing, e.g. an electronic tablet. On-line recognition rates are higher than o -line recognition rates because the dynamic information improves recognition accuracy. Writer independent recognition rates of 98% for lexica with 1000 entries have been reported. The main goal of this thesis is to extract dynamic information from static word images. For static word images written on a paper-like medium no information about the production process of writing is available. However, extracting dynamic information from static images allows the application of powerful online methods to o -line problems. Conversely, o -line methods help to improve on-line recognition rates because temporal information complicates recognition with variations that are not apparent in the static images. Hence, extracting dynamic information and combining on-line methods with o -line methods helps to get a uni ed view of handwriting recognition which is independent of a speci c application. In the framework of this thesis, extracting dynamic information is equivalent to recovering information about sequences of pen movements. The extraction of vi pen pressure and velocity is neglected. A sequence of pen movements is de ned by a sequence of edges in the skeleton of a binary word image. The skeleton is a mathematical construct comprising nodes and edges. It can be regarded as a mathematical abstraction of the written word coinciding in most areas with the centerline of the writing trace, where edges correspond to parts of strokes and nodes correspond to intersections or end points. With the help of the skeleton, the extraction of dynamic information can be de ned as a graph-theoretical problem. In particular, the extraction of dynamic information is understood as a global optimization problem that can be solved using graph-theoretical methods. Two optimization problems are investigated in this thesis: the minimization of length and the minimization of curvature. An important constraint is that traces which are composed of several intersecting strokes, where a stroke is the trace written between a pen-down and a pen-up, can only be approximated. The minimization of length is based on the assumption that writers tend to write a word with minimal length, i.e. without traversing long edges more than once. The search for the shortest path is equivalent to the search for the shortest path in the skeleton of the static word image. This search is called Chinese postman problem in graph-theoretical terms. The minimization of curvature is based on the assumption that writers tend to minimize the deviation from the straight writing line at nodes of the skeleton. This problem is equivalent to the search for a traveling salesman tour in a graph that can be derived from the skeleton in a straightforward manner. While the Chinese postman problem can be solved in polynomial time, the traveling salesman problem is a well-known NP-hard problem. It is shown that the restriction to graphs derived from planar skeletons and the use of a speci c cost function cannot reduce the complexity. For that reason, we present a method that detects splitting edges dividing a word into subparts. The optimization problems can be independently solved for each subpart without changing the global solution. Substantial processing steps of the graph-theoretical methods utilized in this thesis can be described using a discrete, linear mathematical model. This model resembles a speci c cybernetic model that is based on recursion and feedback. It can be implemented by a simple multiplication of matrices. Practical examples show the good performance of the presented methods. However, they illustrate that some writing traces cannot be recovered using length minimization. O -line images that have been generated from genuine on-line data are used for quantitative evaluations. The edges of their skeletons are ordered using the on-line data. This provides a set of known writing traces which can be compared to recovered writing traces using the Levenshtein distance. The vii measured error is moderate and length minimization together with a proper local continuity criterion renders similarly good results as curvature minimization (average Levenshtein distance: 4, average length of sequences: > 17). In another experiment, an existing on-line recognizer is trained and tested with recovered on-line information extracted from addresses containing handwritten American city names. The results are compared to the rates of an o -line recognizer (94%). Though the o -line recognition rates are still higher, the on-line recognition rates based on the recovered on-line data (73%) reach the state of the art in postal automation in the early nineties. In particular, 50% of the words that are wrongly classi ed by the o -line recognizer are correctly classi ed by the on-line recognizer. Hence, the combination of o -line and on-line recognition shows great promise. We have shown that recovering dynamic information from static word images is not only of theoretical signi cance but also feasible and of practical importance. The presented approach is the rst method that provides satisfactory recognition rates of recovered information and facilitates a uni ed view of handwriting recognition. It is to be expected that the recovery of dynamic information will be adopted by other researchers and also tested in other applications, e.g. signature veri cation.

This problem may, in fact, be much more difficult than it appears.

After discussing briefly the character recognition abilities of humans and computers, we present illustrated examples of recognition errors. The top level of our taxonomy of the causes of errors consists of Imaging Defects, Similar Symbols, Punctuation, and Typography. The analysis of a series of 'snippets' from this perspective provides insight into the strengths and weaknesses of current systems, and perhaps a road map to future progress. The examples were drawn from the large-scale tests conducted by the authors at the Information Science Research Institute of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. By way of conclusion, we point to possible approaches for improving the accuracy of today's systems. The talk is based on our eponymous monograph, recently published in The Kluwer International Series in Engineering and Computer Science, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1999."
