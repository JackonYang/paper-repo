The DBNN adopts a hierarchical network structure with nonlinear basis functions and a competitive credit-assignment scheme. The face recognition system consists of three modules. First, a face detector finds the location of a human face in an image. Then an eye localizer determines the positions of both eyes to help generate size-normalized, reoriented, and reduced-resolution feature vectors. (The facial region proposed contains eyebrows, eyes, and nose, but excluding mouth. Eye-glasses will be permissible.) The last module is a face recognizer. The DBNN can be effectively applied to all the three modules. The DBNN based face recognizer has yielded very high recognition accuracies based on experiments on the ARPA-FERET and SCR-IM databases. In terms of processing speeds and recognition accuracies, the performance of DBNN is superior to that of multilayer perceptron (MLP). The training phase for 100 persons would take around one hour, while the recognition phase (including eye localization, feature extraction, and classification using DBNN) consumes only a fraction of a second (on Sparc10)."

The task involves finding specific (but locally deformable) patterns in images, such as human faces and eyes/mouths. There are many important commercial applications. This paper presents a decision-based neural network for finding such patterns with specific applications to detecting human faces and locating eyes in the faces. The system built upon the proposal has been demonstrated to be applicable under reasonable variations of orientation and/or lighting, and with the possibility of eye glasses. This method has been shown to be very robust against a large variation of face features and eye shapes. The algorithm takes only 200 ms on a SUN Sparc20 workstation to find human faces in an image with 320/spl times/240 pixels. For a facial image with 320/spl times/240 pixels, the algorithm takes 500 ms to locate two eyes on a SUN Sparc20 workstation. Furthermore, the algorithm can be easily implemented via specialised hardware for real time performance. We have applied this technique to two applications (surveillance system, video browsing) and this paper provides experimental results. Although we have only shown its successful implementation on face detection and eye localization, the proposed technique is meant for more general applications of detection of any (locally deformable) object."

The system combines local image sampling, a self-organizing map (SOM) neural network, and a convolutional neural network. The SOM provides a quantization of the image samples into a topological space where inputs that are nearby in the original space are also nearby in the output space, thereby providing dimensionality reduction and invariance to minor changes in the image sample, and the convolutional neural network provides partial invariance to translation, rotation, scale, and deformation. The convolutional network extracts successively larger features in a hierarchical set of layers. We present results using the Karhunen-Loeve transform in place of the SOM, and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) in place of the convolutional network for comparison. We use a database of 400 images of 40 individuals which contains quite a high degree of variability in expression, pose, and facial details. We analyze the computational complexity and discuss how new classes could be added to the trained recognizer."

The mixture-distance technique we introduce achieves a recognition rate of 95% on a database of 685 people in which each face is represented by 30 measured distances. This is currently the best recorded recognition rate for a feature-based system applied to a database of this size. By comparison, nearest neighbor search using Euclidean distance yields 84%. In our work a novel distance function is constructed based on local second order statistics as estimated by modeling the training data as a mixture of normal densities. We report on the results from mixtures of several sizes. We demonstrate that a flat mixture of mixtures performs as well as the best model and therefore represents an effective solution to the model selection problem. A mixture perspective is also taken for individual Gaussians to choose between first order (variance) and second order (covariance) models. Here an approximation to flat combination is proposed and seen to perform well in practice. Our results demonstrate that even in the absence of multiple training examples for each class, it is sometimes possible to infer from a statistical model of training data, a significantly improved distance function for use in pattern recognition."

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture."

A retinally connected neural network examines small windows of an image, and decides whether each window contains a face. The system arbitrates between multiple networks to improve performance over a single network. We use a bootstrap algorithm for training, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images. Comparisons with another state-of-the-art face detection system are presented; our system has better performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates."

The dynamic link architecture exploits correlations in the fine-scale temporal structure of cellular signals to group neurons dynamically into higher-order entities. These entities represent a rich structure and can code for high-level objects. To demonstrate the capabilities of the dynamic link architecture, a program was implemented that can recognize human faces and other objects from video images. Memorized objects are represented by sparse graphs, whose vertices are labeled by a multiresolution description in terms of a local power spectrum, and whose edges are labeled by geometrical distance vectors. Object recognition can be formulated as elastic graph matching, which is performed here by stochastic optimization of a matching cost function. The implementation on a transputer network achieved recognition of human faces and office objects from gray-level camera images. The performance of the program is evaluated by a statistical analysis of recognition results from a portrait gallery comprising images of 87 persons. >"

More specifically, a decision-based neural network (DBNN) is proposed, which combines the perceptron-like learning rule and hierarchical nonlinear network structure. The decision-based mutual training can be applied to both static and temporal pattern recognition problems. For static pattern recognition, two hierarchical structures are proposed: hidden-node and subcluster structures. The relationships between DBNN's and other models (linear perceptron, piecewise-linear perceptron, LVQ, and PNN) are discussed. As to temporal DBNN's, model-based discriminant functions may be chosen to compensate possible temporal variations, such as waveform warping and alignments. Typical examples include DTW distance, prediction error, or likelihood functions. For classification applications, DBNN's are very effective in computation time and performance. This is confirmed by simulations conducted for several applications, including texture classification, OCR, and ECG analysis."

Machine recognition of faces has several applications, ranging from static matching of controlled photographs as in mug shots matching and credit card verification to surveillance video images. Such applications have different constraints in terms of complexity of processing requirements and thus present a wide range of different technical challenges. Over the last 20 years researchers in psychophysics, neural sciences and engineering, image processing analysis and computer vision have investigated a number of issues related to face recognition by humans and machines. Ongoing research activities have been given a renewed emphasis over the last five years. Existing techniques and systems have been tested on different sets of images of varying complexities. But very little synergism exists between studies in psychophysics and the engineering literature. Most importantly, there exists no evaluation or benchmarking studies using large databases with the image quality that arises in commercial and law enforcement applications In this paper, we first present different applications of face recognition in commercial and law enforcement sectors. This is followed by a brief overview of the literature on face recognition in the psychophysics community. We then present a detailed overview of move than 20 years of research done in the engineering community. Techniques for segmentation/location of the face, feature extraction and recognition are reviewed. Global transform and feature based methods using statistical, structural and neural classifiers are summarized. >"

We combine the K-L expansion technique with two new operations that transform the face pattern into an invariant feature space. The two operations are the affine transformation which yields a standard face view from the input face image, and its transformation into the Fourier spectrum domain, which develops the property of shift-invariance. Although the basic idea of applying the K-L expansion to extract features for face recognition originates from the eigenface approach proposed by Turk and Pentland our scheme offers superior performance due to the transformation into the invariant feature space. The performance of the two schemes for face identification against various imaging conditions is compared."

When pattern classes are clearly separated, such learning usually provides very fast and yet satisfactory learning performance. Application examples including OCR and (finite) face/object recognition. Different tactics are needed when dealing with overlapping distribution and/or issues on false acceptance/rejection, which arises in applications such as face recognition and verification. For this, a probabilistic DBNN would be more appealing. This paper investigates several training rules augmenting probabilistic DBNN learning, based largely on the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The objective is to establish evidence that the probabilistic DBNN offers an effective tool for multi-sensor classification. Two approaches to multi-sensor classification are proposed and the (enhanced) performance studied. The first involves a hierarchical classification, where sensor information are cascaded in sequential processing stages. The second is multi-sensor fusion, where sensor information are laterally combined to yield improved classification. For the experimental studies, a hierarchical DBNN-based face recognition system is described. For a 38-person face database, the hierarchical classification significantly reduces the false acceptance (from 9.35% to 0%) and false rejection (from 7.29% to 2.25%), as compared to non-hierarchical face recognition. Another promising multiple-sensor classifier fusing face and palm biometric features is also proposed."

A pyramid-like modular network has been developed to learn and identify hand-drawn fKia1 expressions. Because of the nature of the network architecture, image size becomes less of an issue in network learning. The network exhibits a parallel learning capability which could be used to speed up the training process. An analysis of the hidden units of the network reveals that features are used in learning when there is commonality of facial features in the training patterns. We have also demonstrated attention focusing in the network by masking off specific areas of the face during testing. Our network model creates a \"leaner\" representation of the original fe object and classification is based on this representation. By including the leaner representation and separate key features in the final training set we can simulate a coarse-to-find search method, as in image processing."

Thus most data classifiers are designed to have K output nodes corresponding to K classes, {w/sub i/: i=1,...,K}. When pattern classes are clearly separated, this kind of data classifier usually performs very well. A specific model is the decision-based neural network (DBNN), which is effective in many signal/image classification applications. This is particularly the case when pattern classes are clearly separable. However, for those applications which have complex pattern distribution with two or more classes overlapping in pattern space, the traditional DBNN may not be effective or appropriate. For such applications, it is preferable to adopt a probabilistic classifier. In this paper, we develop a new probabilistic variant of the DBNN, which is meant for better estimate probability density functions corresponding to different pattern classes. For this purpose, new learning rules for probabilistic DBNN are derived. In experiments on face databases, we have observed noticeable improvement in various performance measures such as recognition accuracies and, in particular, false acceptance/rejection rates. Taking advantage of probabilistic output values of the DBNN, we construct a multiple sensor fusion system for object classification. In a sense, it represents an extension of the traditional hierarchical structure of DBNN."

The technique models the distribution of human face patterns by means of a few view-based \u201cface\u201d and \u201cnon-face\u201d prototype clusters. A 2-Value metric is proposed for computing distance features between test patterns and the distribution-based face model during classification. We show empirically that the prototypes we choose for our distribution-based model, and the metric we adopt for computing distance feature vectors, are both critical for the success of our system."

This is a practical guide to the application of artificial neural networks. \nGeared toward the practitioner, Pattern Recognition with Neural Networks in C++ covers pattern classification and neural network approaches within the same framework. Through the book's presentation of underlying theory and numerous practical examples, readers gain an understanding that will allow them to make judicious design choices rendering neural application predictable and effective. \nThe book provides an intuitive explanation of each method for each network paradigm. This discussion is supported by a rigorous mathematical approach where necessary. \nC++ has emerged as a rich and descriptive means by which concepts, models, or algorithms can be precisely described. For many of the neural network models discussed, C++ programs are presented for the actual implementation. Pictorial diagrams and in-depth discussions explain each topic. Necessary derivative steps for the mathematical models are included so that readers can incorporate new ideas into their programs as the field advances with new developments. For each approach, the authors clearly state the known theoretical results, the known tendencies of the approach, and their recommendations for getting the best results from the method. \nThe material covered in the book is accessible to working engineers with little or no explicit background in neural networks. However, the material is presented in sufficient depth so that those with prior knowledge will find this book beneficial. Pattern Recognition with Neural Networks in C++ is also suitable for courses in neural networks at an advanced undergraduate or graduate level. This book is valuable for academic as well as practical research."

With the Cresceptron, humans as designers need only to provide a good structure for learning, but they are relieved of most design details. The Cresceptron has been tested on the task of visual recognition by recognizing 3-D general objects from 2-D photographic images of natural scenes and segmenting the recognized objects from the cluttered image background. The Cresceptron uses a hierarchical structure to grow networks automatically, adaptively, and incrementally through learning. The Cresceptron makes it possible to generalize training exemplars to other perceptually equivalent items. Experiments with a variety of real-world images are reported to demonstrate the feasibility of learning in the Cresceptron.<<ETX>>"

These probability densities are then used to formulate a maximum-likelihood estimation framework for visual search and target detection for automatic object recognition. This learning technique is tested in experiments with modeling and subsequent detection of human faces and non-rigid objects such as hands.<<ETX>>"

When the estimation is accurate, network outputs can be treated as probabilities and sum to one. Simple proofs show that Bayesian probabilities are estimated when desired network outputs are 1 of M (one output unity, all others zero) and a squared-error or cross-entropy cost function is used. Results of Monte Carlo simulations performed using multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks trained with backpropagation, radial basis function (RBF) networks, and high-order polynomial networks graphically demonstrate that network outputs provide good estimates of Bayesian probabilities. Estimation accuracy depends on network complexity, the amount of training data, and the degree to which training data reflect true likelihood distributions and a priori class probabilities. Interpretation of network outputs as Bayesian probabilities allows outputs from multiple networks to be combined for higher level decision making, simplifies creation of rejection thresholds, makes it possible to compensate for differences between pattern class probabilities in training and test data, allows outputs to be used to minimize alternative risk functions, and suggests alternative measures of network performance."

Regularization networks are mathematically related to the radial basis functions, mainly used for strict interpolation tasks. Learning as approximation and learning as hypersurface reconstruction are discussed. Two extensions of the regularization approach are presented, along with the approach's corrections to splines, regularization, Bayes formulation, and clustering. The theory of regularization networks is generalized to a formulation that includes task-dependent clustering and dimensionality reduction. Applications of regularization networks are discussed. >"
