However most edge detection schemes ignore the composite nature of these edges, resulting in systematic errors in detection and localization. We address the problem of detecting and localizing these edges, while at the same time also solving the problem of false responses in smoothly shaded regions with constant gradient of the image brightness. We show that a class of nonlinear filters, known as quadratic filters, are appropriate for this task, while linear filters are not. A series of performance criteria are derived for characterizing the SNR, localization and multiple responses of these filters in a manner analogous to Canny''s criteria for linear filters. A two-dimensional version of the approach is developed which has the property of being able to represent multiple edges at the same location and determine the orientation and curvature of the edges at each point. Experimental results are presented."

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

                "text": "An algorithm for finding texture boundaries in images is developed on the basis of a computational model of human texture perception. The model consists of three stages: (1) the image is convolved with a bank of even-symmetric linear filters followed by half-wave rectification to give a set of responses; (2) inhibition, localized in space, within and among the neural response profiles results in the suppression of weak responses when there are strong responses at the same or nearby locations; and (3) texture boundaries are detected using peaks in the gradients of the inhibited response profiles. The model is precisely specified, equally applicable to grey-scale and binary textures, and is motivated by detailed comparison with psychophysics and physiology. It makes predictions about the degree of discriminability of different texture pairs which match very well with experimental measurements of discriminability in human observers. From a machine-vision point of view, the scheme is a high-quality texture-edge detector which works equally on images of artificial and natural scenes. The algorithm makes the use of simple local and parallel operations, which makes it potentially real-time.<<ETX>>"

The authors show how to design and steer filters, and present examples of their use in several tasks: the analysis of orientation and phase, angularly adaptive filtering, edge detection, and shape-from-shading. It is also possible to build a self-similar steerable pyramid representation which may be considered to be a steerable wavelet transform. The same concepts can be generalized to the design of 3-D steerable filters, which should be useful in the analysis of image sequences and volumetric data.<<ETX>>"

We suggest that the points in a waveform that have unique perceptual significance as \u2018lines\u2019 and \u2018edges\u2019 are the points where the Fourier components of the waveform come into phase with each other. At these points \u2018local energy\u2019 is maximal. Local energy is defined as the square root of the sum of the squared response of sets of matched filters, of identical amplitude spectrum but differing in phase spectrum by 90\u00b0: one filter type has an even-symmetric line-spread function, the other an odd-symmetric line-spread function. For a line the main contribution to the local energy peak is in the output of the even-symmetric filters, whereas for edges it is in the output of the odd-symmetric filters. If both filter types respond at the peak of local energy, both edges and lines are seen, either simultaneously or alternating in time. The model was tested with a series of images, and shown to predict well the position of perceived features and the organization of the images."

Motion sinformation can be extracted by a system that responds to the oriented spatiotemporal energy. We discuss a class of models for human motion mechanisms in which the first stage consists of linear filters that are oriented in space-time and tuned in spatial frequency. The outputs of quadrature pairs of such filters are squared and summed to give a measure of motion energy. These responses are then fed into an opponent stage. Energy models can be built from elements that are consistent with known physiology and psychophysics, and they permit a qualitative understanding of a variety of motion phenomena."

This explanation equates Mach bands with distortions in a processed luminance distribution due to selective attenuation of low frequency components. But square waveforms exhibit no Mach bands2,5,6, although they should also be distorted after processing. Measurements of the contrast required to see Mach bands in trapezoidal waveforms and manipulations of their spectra lead us to conclude that phase relationships between Fourier components are important to the structure we perceive. A model based on the odd and even symmetry of visual receptive fields explains our results."

Fluctuations of integrals involving I2(t) are discussed in section 3.9. The probability distribution of a sine wave plus a noise current is given in 3.10 and in 3.11 an alternative method of deriving the results of Part III is mentioned. Prof. Uhlenbeck has pointed out that much of the material in this Part is closely connected with the theory of Markoff processes. Also S. Chandrasekhar has written a review of a class of physical problems which is related, in a general way, to the present subject.22"
