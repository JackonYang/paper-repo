In this paper we report results of a DBN-pretrained context-dependent ANN/HMM system trained on two datasets that are much larger than any reported previously with DBN-pretrained ANN/HMM systems 5870 hours of Voice Search and 1400 hours of YouTube data. On the first dataset, the pretrained ANN/HMM system outperforms the best Gaussian Mixture Model Hidden Markov Model (GMM/HMM) baseline, built with a much larger dataset by 3.7% absolute WER, while on the second dataset, it outperforms the GMM/HMM baseline by 4.7% absolute. Maximum Mutual Information (MMI) fine tuning and model combination using Segmental Conditional Random Fields (SCARF) give additional gains of 0.1% and 0.4% on the first dataset and 0.5% and 0.9% absolute on the second dataset."

As a prospective key component of future speech recognizers, the architectural design of the DSN and its parallel training endow the DSN with scalability over a vast amount of training data. In this paper, we present our first parallel implementation of the DSN training algorithm. Particularly, we show the tradeoff between the time/memory saving via training parallelism and the associated cost arising from inter-CPU communication. Further, in phone classification experiments, we demonstrate a significantly lowered error rate using parallel full-batch training distributed over a CPU cluster, compared with sequential minibatch training implemented in a single CPU machine under otherwise identical experimental conditions and as exploited prior to the work reported in this paper."

For the sMBR criterion, this training algorithm is faster than stochastic gradient descent by a factor of 5.5 and yields a 4.4% relative improvement in word error rate on a 50-hour broadcast news task. Distributed Hessian-free sMBR training yields relative reductions in word error rate of 7\u201313% over cross-entropy training with stochastic gradient descent on two larger tasks: Switchboard and DARPA RATS noisy Levantine Arabic.

Recently, an alternative structure was proposed which trains a NN with a constant number of hidden units to predict output targets, and then reduces the dimensionality of these output probabilities through an auto-encoder, to create auto-encoder bottleneck (AE-BN) features. The benefit of placing the BN after the posterior estimation network is that it avoids the loss in frame classification accuracy incurred by networks that place the BN before the softmax. In this work, we investigate the use of pre-training when creating AE-BN features. Our experiments indicate that with the AE-BN architecture, pre-trained and deeper NNs produce better AE-BN features. On a 50-hour English Broadcast News task, the AE-BN features provide over a 1% absolute improvement compared to a state-of-the-art GMM/HMM with a WER of 18.8% and pre-trained NN hybrid system with a WER of 18.4%. In addition, on a larger 430-hour Broadcast News task, AE-BN features provide a 0.5% absolute improvement over a strong GMM/HMM baseline with a WER of 16.0%. Finally, system combination with the GMM/HMM baseline and AE-BN systems provides an additional 0.5% absolute on 430 hours over the AE-BN system alone, yielding a final WER of 15.0%."

However, the RBM objective function cannot be maximized directly. Therefore, it is not clear what function to monitor when deciding to stop the training, leading to a challenge in managing the computational costs. The Sparse Encoding Symmetric Machine (SESM) has been suggested as an alternative method for pre-training. By placing a sparseness term on the NN output codebook, SESM allows the objective function to be optimized directly and reliably be monitored as an indicator to stop the training. In this paper, we explore SESM to pre-train DBNs and apply this the first time to speech recognition. First, we provide a detailed analysis comparing the behavior of SESM and RBM. Second, we compare the performance of SESM pre-trained and RBM pre-trained DBNs on TIMIT and a 50 hour English Broadcast News task. Results indicate that pre-trained DBNs using SESM and RBMs achieve comparable performance and outperform randomly initialized DBNs with SESM providing a much easier stopping criterion relative to RBM."

For a given input, SC minimizes a quadratic reconstruction error with an L1 penalty term on the code. The process is often too slow for applications such as real-time pattern recognition. We proposed two versions of a very fast algorithm that produces approximate estimates of the sparse code that can be used to compute good visual features, or to initialize exact iterative algorithms. The main idea is to train a non-linear, feed-forward predictor with a specific architecture and a fixed depth to produce the best possible approximation of the sparse code. A version of the method, which can be seen as a trainable version of Li and Osher's coordinate descent method, is shown to produce approximate solutions with 10 times less computation than Li and Os-her's for the same approximation error. Unlike previous proposals for sparse code predictors, the system allows a kind of approximate \"explaining away\" to take place during inference. The resulting predictor is differentiable and can be included into globally-trained recognition systems."

The aim of this thesis is to alleviate these two limitations by proposing algorithms to learn good internal representations, and invariant feature hierarchies from unlabeled data. These methods go beyond traditional supervised learning algorithms, and rely on unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning. \nIn particular, this work focuses on \u201cdeep learning\u201d methods, a set of techniques and principles to train hierarchical models. Hierarchical models produce feature hierarchies that can capture complex non-linear dependencies among the observed data variables in a concise and efficient manner. After training, these models can be employed in real-time systems because they compute the representation by a very fast forward propagation of the input through a sequence of non-linear transformations. When the paucity of labeled data does not allow the use of traditional supervised algorithms, each layer of the hierarchy can be trained in sequence starting at the bottom by using unsupervised or semi-supervised algorithms. Once each layer has been trained, the whole system can be fine-tuned in an end-to-end fashion. We propose several unsupervised algorithms that can be used as building block to train such feature hierarchies. We investigate algorithms that produce sparse overcomplete representations and features that are invariant to known and learned transformations. These algorithms are designed using the Energy-Based Model framework and gradient-based optimization techniques that scale well on large datasets. The principle underlying these algorithms is to learn representations that are at the same time sparse, able to reconstruct the observation, and directly predictable by some learned mapping that can be used for fast inference in test time. \nWith the general principles at the foundation of these algorithms, we validate these models on a variety of tasks, from visual object recognition to text document classification and retrieval."

In this paper, we consider the problem of training a deep network with billions of parameters using tens of thousands of CPU cores. We have developed a software framework called DistBelief that can utilize computing clusters with thousands of machines to train large models. Within this framework, we have developed two algorithms for large-scale distributed training: (i) Downpour SGD, an asynchronous stochastic gradient descent procedure supporting a large number of model replicas, and (ii) Sandblaster, a framework that supports a variety of distributed batch optimization procedures, including a distributed implementation of L-BFGS. Downpour SGD and Sandblaster L-BFGS both increase the scale and speed of deep network training. We have successfully used our system to train a deep network 30x larger than previously reported in the literature, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet, a visual object recognition task with 16 million images and 21k categories. We show that these same techniques dramatically accelerate the training of a more modestly- sized deep network for a commercial speech recognition service. Although we focus on and report performance of these methods as applied to training large neural networks, the underlying algorithms are applicable to any gradient-based machine learning algorithm."

We describe a locally competitive algorithm (LCA) that solves a collection of sparse coding principles minimizing a weighted combination of mean-squared error and a coefficient cost function. LCAs are designed to be implemented in a dynamical system composed of many neuron-like elements operating in parallel. These algorithms use thresholding functions to induce local (usually one-way) inhibitory competitions between nodes to produce sparse representations. LCAs produce coefficients with sparsity levels comparable to the most popular centralized sparse coding algorithms while being readily suited for neural implementation. Additionally, LCA coefficients for video sequences demonstrate inertial properties that are both qualitatively and quantitatively more regular (i.e., smoother and more predictable) than the coefficients produced by greedy algorithms."

This way of combining individual expert models makes it hard to generate samples from the combined model but easy to infer the values of the latent variables of each expert, because the combination rule ensures that the latent variables of different experts are conditionally independent when given the data. A product of experts (PoE) is therefore an interesting candidate for a perceptual system in which rapid inference is vital and generation is unnecessary. Training a PoE by maximizing the likelihood of the data is difficult because it is hard even to approximate the derivatives of the renormalization term in the combination rule. Fortunately, a PoE can be trained using a different objective function called contrastive divergence whose derivatives with regard to the parameters can be approximated accurately and efficiently. Examples are presented of contrastive divergence learning using several types of expert on several types of data."

Metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms."
