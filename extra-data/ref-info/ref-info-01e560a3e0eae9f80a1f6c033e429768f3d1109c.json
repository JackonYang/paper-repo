The max-product \"belief propagation\" algorithm is a local-message-passing algorithm on this graph that is known to converge to a unique fixed point when the graph is a tree. Furthermore, when the graph is a tree, the assignment based on the fixed point yields the most probable values of the unobserved variables given the observed ones. Good empirical performance has been obtained by running the max-product algorithm (or the equivalent min-sum algorithm) on graphs with loops, for applications including the decoding of \"turbo\" codes. Except for two simple graphs (cycle codes and single-loop graphs) there has been little theoretical understanding of the max-product algorithm on graphs with loops. Here we prove a result on the fixed points of max-product on a graph with arbitrary topology and with arbitrary probability distributions (discrete- or continuous-valued nodes). We show that the assignment based on a fixed point is a \"neighborhood maximum\" of the posterior probability: the posterior probability of the max-product assignment is guaranteed to be greater than all other assignments in a particular large region around that assignment. The region includes all assignments that differ from the max-product assignment in any subset of nodes that form no more than a single loop in the graph. In some graphs, this neighborhood is exponentially large. We illustrate the analysis with examples."

This class includes the belief propagation (BP) or sum-product algorithm as well as variations and extensions of BP. Algorithms in this class can be formulated as a sequence of reparameterization updates, each of which entails refactorizing a portion of the distribution corresponding to an acyclic subgraph (i.e., a tree, or more generally, a hypertree). The ultimate goal is to obtain an alternative but equivalent factorization using functions that represent (exact or approximate) marginal distributions on cliques of the graph. Our framework highlights an important property of the sum-product algorithm and the larger class of reparameterization algorithms: the original distribution on the graph with cycles is not changed. The perspective of tree-based updates gives rise to a simple and intuitive characterization of the fixed points in terms of tree consistency. We develop interpretations of these results in terms of information geometry. The invariance of the distribution, in conjunction with the fixed-point characterization, enables us to derive an exact expression for the difference between the true marginals on an arbitrary graph with cycles, and the approximations provided by belief propagation. More broadly, our analysis applies to any algorithm that minimizes the Bethe free energy. We also develop bounds on the approximation error, which illuminate the conditions that govern their accuracy. Finally, we show how the reparameterization perspective extends naturally to generalizations of BP (e.g., Kikuchi (1951) approximations and variants) via the notion of hypertree reparameterization."

Slight extensions of our analysis lead to a.79607-approximation algorithm for the maximum directed cut problem (MAX DICUT) and a.758-approximation algorithm for MAX SAT, where the best previously known approximation algorithms had performance guarantees of 1/4 and 3/4, respectively. Our algorithm gives the first substantial progress in approximating MAX CUT in nearly twenty years, and represents the first use of semidefinite programming in the design of approximation algorithms."

                "text": "Stochastic processes de ned on graphs arise in a tremendous variety of elds, including statistical physics, signal processing, computer vision, arti cial intelligence, and information theory. The formalism of graphical models provides a useful language with which to formulate fundamental problems common to all of these elds, including estimation, model tting, and sampling. For graphs without cycles, known as trees, all of these problems are relatively well-understood, and can be solved e\u00c6ciently with algorithms whose complexity scales in a tractable manner with problem size. In contrast, these same problems present considerable challenges in general graphs with cycles. The focus of this thesis is the development and analysis of methods, both exact and approximate, for problems on graphs with cycles. Our contributions are in developing and analyzing techniques for estimation, as well as methods for computing upper and lower bounds on quantities of interest (e.g., marginal probabilities; partition functions). In order to do so, we make use of exponential representations of distributions, as well as insight from the associated information geometry and Legendre duality. Our results demonstrate the power of exponential representations for graphical models, as well as the utility of studying collections of modi ed problems de ned on trees embedded within the original graph with cycles. The speci c contributions of this thesis include the following. We develop a method for performing exact estimation of Gaussian processes on graphs with cycles by solving a sequence of modi ed problems on embedded spanning trees. We present the tree-based reparameterization framework for approximate estimation of discrete processes. This framework leads to a number of theoretical results on belief propagation and related algorithms, including characterizations of their xed points and the associated approximation error. Next we extend the notion of reparameterization to a much broader class of methods for approximate inference, including Kikuchi methods, and present results on their xed points and accuracy. Finally, we develop and analyze a novel class of upper bounds on the log partition function based on convex combinations of distributions in the exponential domain. In the special case of combining tree-structured distributions, the associated dual function gives an interesting perspective on the Bethe free energy. Thesis Supervisors: Alan S.

When the graph is singly connected, local propagation rules of the sort proposed by Pearl (1988) are guaranteed to converge to the correct posterior probabilities. Recently a number of researchers have empirically demonstrated good performance of these same local propagation schemes on graphs with loops, but a theoretical understanding of this performance has yet to be achieved. For graphical models with a single loop, we derive an analytical relationship between the probabilities computed using local propagation and the correct marginals. Using this relationship we show a category of graphical models with loops for which local propagation gives rise to provably optimal maximum a posteriori assignments (although the computed marginals will be incorrect). We also show how nodes can use local information in the messages they receive in order to correct their computed marginals. We discuss how these results can be extended to graphical models with multiple loops and show simulation results suggesting that some properties of propagation on single-loop graphs may hold for a larger class of graphs. Specifically we discuss the implication of our results for understanding a class of recently proposed error-correcting codes known as turbo codes."

                "text": "Independence densities of hypergraphs We consider the number of independent sets in hypergraphs, which allows us to define the independence density of countable hypergraphs. Hypergraph independence densities include a broad family of densities over graphs and relational structures, such as F-free densities of graphs for a given graph F. We consider the rationality of independence densities of hypergraphs, and present extensions using independence polynomials. The complexity of signed graph homomorphisms Given a graph G = (V, E), a signing of E is the assignment of + or \u2212 to each edge of G. Let \u03a3 \u2286 E be the set of negative. We call (G, \u03a3) a signed graph. To switch at a vertex v is a resigning of all the positive edges incident at v to negative and vice versa. Two signed graphs (G, \u03a3) and (G, \u03a3) are equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by a sequence of switches. The class of all signed graphs equivalent to (G, \u03a3) is denoted [G, \u03a3]. A homomorphism of (G, \u03a3) \u2192 (H, \u03a0) is a vertex map that preserves edges and their signs. A homomorphism of equivalence classes [G, \u03a3] \u2192 [H, \u03a0] exists if some member (G, \u03a3) \u2208 [G, \u03a3] admits a homomorphism to some member (H, \u03a0) \u2208 [H, \u03a0]. In this talk we examine and contrast the computational complexity of determining the existence of signed graph homomorphisms in the case that switching is not allowed, i.e. viewing the objects as edge-coloured graphs, and where switching is allowed, i.e. homomorphisms of equivalence classes. In particular, we give a dichotomy theorem for the latter case. A convexity or alignment on a finite set V is a collection of subsets of V containing the empty set, and the whole set V , and is closed under intersection; this forms a natural combinatorial generalization of convexity in euclidean space. Now let G be a graph of order n. A subset C of vertices of G is g-convex if for every pair u, v \u2208 C the vertices on every u\u2013v geodesic (i.e. shortest u\u2013v path) belong to C. The set of g-convex subsets of a graph are an interesting subfamily of alignments. In this talk we will discuss three aspects of g-convexity: the structure of g-minimal graphs (those that have the minimal number of g-convex sets), the complexity of counting g-convex sets in a graph, and when \u2026"

The major restriction is that the energy function's smoothness term must only involve pairs of pixels. We propose two algorithms that use graph cuts to compute a local minimum even when very large moves are allowed. The first move we consider is an /spl alpha/-/spl beta/-swap: for a pair of labels /spl alpha/,/spl beta/, this move exchanges the labels between an arbitrary set of pixels labeled a and another arbitrary set labeled /spl beta/. Our first algorithm generates a labeling such that there is no swap move that decreases the energy. The second move we consider is an /spl alpha/-expansion: for a label a, this move assigns an arbitrary set of pixels the label /spl alpha/. Our second algorithm, which requires the smoothness term to be a metric, generates a labeling such that there is no expansion move that decreases the energy. Moreover, this solution is within a known factor of the global minimum. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration, stereo and motion."

This result characterizes BP fixed-points and makes connections with variational approaches to approximate inference. \n \nMore importantly, our analysis lets us build on the progress made in statistical physics since Bethe's approximation was introduced in 1935. Kikuchi and others have shown how to construct more accurate free energy approximations, of which Bethe's approximation is the simplest. Exploiting the insights from our analysis, we derive generalized belief propagation (GBP) versions of these Kikuchi approximations. These new message passing algorithms can be significantly more accurate than ordinary BP, at an adjustable increase in complexity. We illustrate such a new GBP algorithm on a grid Markov network and show that it gives much more accurate marginal probabilities than those found using ordinary BP."

                "text": "Iterative decoding techniques have become a viable alternative for constructing high performance coding systems. In particular, the recent success of turbo codes indicates that performance close to the Shannon limit may be achieved. In this thesis, it is showed that many iterative decoding algorithms are special cases of two generic algorithms, the min-sum and sum-product algorithms, which also include non-iterative algorithms such as Viterbi decoding. The min-sum and sum-product algorithms are developed and presented as generalized trellis algorithms, where the time axis of the trellis is replaced by an arbitrary graph, the \u201cTanner graph\u201d. With cycle-free Tanner graphs, the resulting decoding algorithms (e.g., Viterbi decoding) are maximum-likelihood but suffer from an exponentially increasing complexity. Iterative decoding occurs when the Tanner graph has cycles (e.g., turbo codes); the resulting algorithms are in general suboptimal, but significant complexity reductions are possible compared to the cycle-free case. Several performance estimates for iterative decoding are developed, including a generalization of the union bound used with Viterbi decoding and a characterization of errors that are uncorrectable after infinitely many decoding iterations."

An active line of research in this area is concerned with classification when one has information about pairwise relationships among the objects to be classified; this issue is one of the principal motivations for the framework of Markov random fields, and it arises in areas such as image processing, biometry: and document analysis. In its most basic form, this style of analysis seeks a classification that optimizes a combinatorial function consisting of assignment costs-based on the individual choice of label we make for each object-and separation costs-based on the pair of choices we make for two \"related\" objects. We formulate a general classification problem of this type, the metric labeling problem; we show that it contains as special cases a number of standard classification frameworks, including several arising from the theory of Markov random fields. From the perspective of combinatorial optimization, our problem can be viewed as a substantial generalization of the multiway cut problem, and equivalent to a type of uncapacitated quadratic assignment problem. We provide the first non-trivial polynomial-time approximation algorithms for a general family of classification problems of this type. Our main result is an O(log k log log k)-approximation algorithm for the metric labeling problem, with respect to an arbitrary metric on a set of k labels, and an arbitrary weighted graph of relationships on a set of objects. For the special case in which the labels are endowed with the uniform metric-all distances are the same-our methods provide a 2-approximation."

The backward-forward model is devoted to the simultaneous solution of a collection of interrelated sequential problems based on the independent computation of a cost-to-arrive function and a cost-to-go function.

While the structural properties of turbo codes and low density parity check codes have now been put on a firm theoretical footing, what is still lacking is a satisfactory theoretical explanation as to why iterative decoding algorithms perform as well as they do. In this thesis we make a first step by discussing the behavior of various iterative decoders for the graphs of tail-biting codes and cycle codes. By increasing our understanding of the behavior of the iterative min-sum (MSA) and sum-product (SPA) algorithms on graphs with cycles, we can design codes which achieve better performance.\n\nMuch of this thesis is devoted to the analysis of the performance of the MSA and SPA on the graphs for tail-biting codes and cycle codes. We give sufficient conditions for the MSA to converge to the maximum likelihood codeword after a finite number of iterations. We also use the familiar union bound argument to characterize the performance of the MSA after many iterations. For a cycle code, we show that the performance of the MSA decoder is asymptotically as good as maximum likelihood. For tail-biting codes this will depend on our choice of trellis."

                "text": "One of the major obstacles to using Bayesian methods for pattern recognition has been its computational expense. This thesis presents an approximation technique that can perform Bayesian inference faster and more accurately than previously possible. This method, \u201cExpectation Propagation,\u201d unifies and generalizes two previous techniques: assumed-density filtering, an extension of the Kalman filter, and loopy belief propagation, an extension of belief propagation in Bayesian networks. The unification shows how both of these algorithms can be viewed as approximating the true posterior distribution with simpler distribution, which is close in the sense of KL-divergence. Expectation Propagation exploits the best of both algorithms: the generality of assumed-density filtering and the accuracy of loopy belief propagation. \nLoopy belief propagation, because it propagates exact belief states, is useful for limited types of belief networks, such as purely discrete networks. Expectation Propagation approximates the belief states with expectations, such as means and variances, giving it much wider scope. Expectation Propagation also extends belief propagation in the opposite direction\u2014propagating richer belief states which incorporate correlations between variables. \nThis framework is demonstrated in a variety of statistical models using synthetic and real-world data. On Gaussian mixture problems, Expectation Propagation is found, for the same amount of computation, to be convincingly better than rival approximation techniques: Monte Carlo, Laplace's method, and variational Bayes. For pattern recognition, Expectation Propagation provides an algorithm for training Bayes Point Machine classifiers that is faster and more accurate than any previously known. The resulting classifiers outperform Support Vector Machines on several standard datasets, in addition to having a comparable training time. Expectation Propagation can also be used to choose an appropriate feature set for classification, via Bayesian model selection.

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

The remaining five chapters treat control theory for Markov models, models for duration and size, models for social systems with fixed class sizes, and simple and general epidemic models for the diffusion of news, rumors, and ideas. Simple epidemic models are birth process models that assume that infection is an irreversible state, so given either a constant individual rate of transmission or a single constant source of transmission, the entire population is eventually infected. General epidemic models allow for the duration of infection to be a random variable. The book ends with a full, up-to-date bibliography, an author index, and a subject index. In summary, Bartholomew gives an excellent introduction to many types of stochastic processes and a broad range of applications for modeling and planning social systems. The applications of stochastic processes to studying social mobility and flows of personnel within organizations receive much more extended treatment here than in other introductory treatments of applied stochastic processes. The \"Complements\" section at the end of each chapter is a useful overview of recent research investigations in many other areas of application that apply or extend the models presented in the chapter. Since no problems for solution are contained and the exposition is often informal, some teachers may wish to supplement the book with more traditional stochastic process textbooks, one good choice being Karlin and Taylor (1975). There seem to be few typographical errors."

The pseudocodewords of such a tree are the words that satisfy all tree constraintsj pseudocodewords govern decoding performance. Wiberg [12] determined the effective weight of pseudocodewords for binary codewords on an AWGN channel. This paper extends Wiberg\u2019s formula for AWGN channels to nonbinary codes, develops similar results for BSC and BEC channels, and gives upper and lower bounds on the effective weight. The 16-state tail-biting trellis of the Golay code [2] is used for exampIes. Although in this case no pseudocodeword is found with effective weight less than the minimum Hamming weight of the Golay code on an AWGN channel, it is shown by example that the minimum effective pseudocodeword weight can be less than the minimum codeword weight."

Smith in the Chair] SUMMARY A continuous two-dimensional region is partitioned into a fine rectangular array of sites or \"pixels\", each pixel having a particular \"colour\" belonging to a prescribed finite set. The true colouring of the region is unknown but, associated with each pixel, there is a possibly multivariate record which conveys imperfect information about its colour according to a known statistical model. The aim is to reconstruct the true scene, with the additional knowledge that pixels close together tend to have the same or similar colours. In this paper, it is assumed that the local characteristics of the true scene can be represented by a nondegenerate Markov random field. Such information can be combined with the records by Bayes' theorem and the true scene can be estimated according to standard criteria. However, the computational burden is enormous and the reconstruction may reflect undesirable largescale properties of the random field. Thus, a simple, iterative method of reconstruction is proposed, which does not depend on these large-scale characteristics. The method is illustrated by computer simulations in which the original scene is not directly related to the assumed random field. Some complications, including parameter estimation, are discussed. Potential applications are mentioned briefly."

For the ferromagnetic Ising model,2 Fridman (2002) showed how to assess the correctness of the max-product assignment in an a priori manner (i.e., before even running the algorithm). The analysis of this paper, in contrast to previous work using computation trees, is based on a different perspective. Any distribution defined by a graphical model is represented as a product of so-called compatibility functions over cliques of the underlying graph. Since the factorization is not unique, it is tempting to seek alternative representations that have desirable properties for solving inference problems. In previous work (Wainwright, Jaakkola and Willsky 2003), we have shown that the sum-product or belief propagation algorithm for graphs with cycles can be viewed as seeking a particular reparameterization of the distribution. In this paper, we show that the conceptual framework of reparameterization can be applied fruitfully to the max-product algorithm on graphs with cycles as well. More specifically, the complexity of the MAP estimation problem stems from the specification of the overall distribution as a (normalized) product of compatibility functions on the cliques of the graph. These functions couple together the optimization of variables at all the nodes. However, the factorization of the overall distribution is not unique, which suggests the idea of finding a new factorization\u2014that is, reparameterizing the distribution\u2014in terms of functions that reduce or remove this coupling. For a distribution on a decomposable graph, a variant of the junction tree theorem (Dawid 1992, Cowell et al. 1999) yields a factorization in terms of so-called max-marginals on the maximal cliques and separator sets of the junction tree. As we elucidate in Section 3 for trees, the message-passing of the max-product algorithm can be understood as computing this max-marginal factorization. At one level, then, solving the MAP estimation problem on a decomposable graph can be viewed as converting from the original representation into a form that makes extracting the MAP estimate computationally simple. Indeed, if each single-node max-marginal has a unique maximum, then the overall MAP estimate can be computed by performing decoupled maximizations of the max-marginals at each node. As we discuss in Section 3, the violation of this assumption is only a minor issue for treestructured distributions. In fact, since the max-product algorithm also computes pairwise max-marginals, dynamic programming methods can be applied to the tree in order to compute one of the MAP estimates. (See also Dawid (1992) for description of a similar sampling procedure for junction trees."

We generalize this result by proving that max-product fixed points exist for any positive distribution on an arbitrary graph with cycles. An interesting implication is that any positive distribution can be factorized in terms of a set of pseudo-max-marginals that are consistent (in a sense that we make precise) on every spanning tree of the graph. We also show in Section 4 that the uniqueness of the single-node maximizers is critical if the pseudo-maxmarginals are to be of any value for MAP estimation. Furthermore, under the assumption of uniqueness, we prove that the max-product assignment on a graph G with cycles is guaranteed to be \u201coptimal\u201d on any subgraph of G containing at most one cycle, where \u201coptimality\u201d here refers to the inability to obtain a better assignment for a modified cost function formed by the product of terms corresponding to the subgraph. This theorem generalizes earlier results by Weiss (2000), and Freeman and Weiss (2001) mentioned previously."

Nonetheless, the loopy max-product algorithm has been used with good results in various applications, including decoding of graphical codes (e.g., Benedetto et al. 1996, Aji et al. 1998, Wiberg 1996) as well as computer vision (e.g., Freeman and Pasztor 1999). Most previous analysis of the max-product algorithm for graphs with cycles is based on an idea that dates back to the work of Gallager (1963)\u2014namely, that of studying the computation tree associated with the parallel message-passing updates. Given some node specified as the root, the corresponding computation tree (at iteration n) represents the set of all possible paths (of length n) that end at this root node; any such path corresponds to the propagation of information in a message from some initial node to the root. More details on such computation trees can be found in (e.g., Gallager 1963, Wiberg 1966, Frey et al. 2001, Weiss 2000, Freeman and Weiss 2001). A number of researchers have studied the maxproduct algorithm in application to a single cycle (e.g., Weiss 2000, Horn 1999, Aji et al. 1998, Frey, Koetter and Vardy 2001; Forney et al. 2001b), for which the computation tree is especially simple\u2014namely, a chain-structured graph. For a single cycle, the message passing updates converge to either a stable fixed point, or a periodic oscillation. When it converges to stable fixed point, the max-product assignment is guaranteed to be exact, as long as a certain uniqueness condition (to be specified) holds. Freeman and Weiss (2001) analyzed the max-product assignment for positive compatibility functions on arbitrary graphs, and showed that the cost of the max-product assignment cannot be improved by changing any subset of the variables that form no more than a single cycle in the underlying graph. In the context of graphs defined by codes, Frey and Koetter (2000) showed that if maxproduct messages are suitably attenuated as they are passed up the computation tree, then the algorithm (if it converges) computes the MAP assignment. For the special case of cycle codes,1 Wiberg (1996) gave sufficient conditions for max-product to fail to converge to the transmitted codeword; see also Horn (1999) for related results on cycle codes."

Building on original research by the authors over a number of years, this book gives a thorough and rigorous mathematical treatment of the underlying ideas, structures, and algorithms, emphasizing those cases in which exact answers are obtainable. The book will be of interest to researchers and graduate students in artificial intelligence who desire an understanding of the mathematical and statistical basis of probabilistic expert systems, and to students and research workers in statistics wanting an introduction to this fascinating and rapidly developing field. The careful attention to detail will also make this work an important reference source for all those involved in the theory and applications of probabilistic expert systems."

The typical minimum distance of these codes increases linearly with block length for a fixed rate and fixed j . When used with maximum likelihood decoding on a sufficiently quiet binary-input symmetric channel, the typical probability of decoding error decreases exponentially with block length for a fixed rate and fixed j . A simple but nonoptimum decoding scheme operating directly from the channel a posteriori probabilities is described. Both the equipment complexity and the data-handling capacity in bits per second of this decoder increase approximately linearly with block length. For j > 3 and a sufficiently low rate, the probability of error using this decoder on a binary symmetric channel is shown to decrease at least exponentially with a root of the block length. Some experimental results show that the actual probability of decoding error is much smaller than this theoretical bound."

As a function of constraint length the performance of optimal convolutional codes is shown to be superior to that of block codes of the same length, the relative improvement increasing with rate.

On a Gaussian channel, maximum a posteriori (MAP) codeword decoding (or \"maximum-likelihood decoding\") decodes to the codeword signal that is closest to the channel output in Euclidean distance. In contrast, we show that iterative decoding decodes to the \"pseudosignal\" that has highest correlation with the channel output. The set of pseudosignals corresponds to \"pseudocodewords\", only a vanishingly small number of which correspond to codewords. We show that some pseudocodewords cause decoding errors, but that there are also pseudocodewords that frequently correct the deleterious effects of other pseudocodewords."

The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty\u0097and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition\u0097in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability."

The algorithms work in a sliding window form, like the Viterbi algorithm, and can thus be used to decode continuously transmitted sequences obtained by parallel concatenated codes, without requiring code trellis termination. A heuristic explanation is also given of how to embed the maximum a posteriori algorithms into the iterative decoding of parallel concatenated codes (turbo codes). The performances of the two algorithms are compared on the basis of a powerful rate 1/3 parallel concatenated code. Basic circuits to implement the simplified a posteriori decoding algorithm using lookup tables, and two further approximations (linear and threshold), with a very small penalty, to eliminate the need for lookup tables are proposed."

However, for many graphs, the process of triangulation leads to an explosion in the clique size, which means that the practical application of this junction tree algorithm is limited. Given the prohibitive cost of the junction tree algorithm, it is reasonable to consider partial triangulations of graphs. Such structures arise in certain extensions to BP, such as the GBP updates of Yedidia, Freeman and Weiss (2001), which can be formulated as minimizing a cost function (e."

From synthetic data, we model the relationship between image and scene patches, and between a scene patch and neighboring scene patches. Given a new image, we propagate likelihoods in a Markov network (ignoring the effect of loops) to infer the underlying scene. This yields an efficient method to form low-level scene interpretations. We demonstrate the technique for motion analysis and estimating high resolution images from low-resolution ones."
