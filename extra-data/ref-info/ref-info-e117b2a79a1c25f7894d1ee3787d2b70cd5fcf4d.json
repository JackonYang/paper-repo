                "text": "This article proposes a novel similarity measure between vector sequences. Recently, a model-based approach was introduced to address this issue. It consists in modeling each sequence with a continuous Hidden Markov Model (CHMM) and computing a probabilistic measure of similarity between C-HMMs. In this paper we propose to model sequences with semi-continuous HMMs (SC-HMMs): the Gaussians of the SC-HMMs are constrained to belong to a shared pool of Gaussians. This constraint provides two major benefits. First, the a priori information contained in the common set of Gaussians leads to a more accurate estimate of the HMM parameters. Second, the computation of a probabilistic similarity between two SC-HMMs can be simplified to a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) between their mixture weight vectors, which reduces significantly the computational cost. Experimental results on a handwritten word retrieval task show that the proposed similarity outperforms the traditional DTW between the original sequences, and the model-based approach which uses C-HMMs. We also show that this increase in accuracy can be traded against a significant reduction of the computational cost (up to 100 times)."

Several approximate KLDs are studied and compared for pairs of GMMs with different properties, and one of them is identified for being used in our DTW-based HMM dissimilarity measure.

The similarity measure is evaluated in the context of online handwriting recognition on lower case character models which have been trained from the UNIPEN database.

The kernel of the system is a hidden Markov model (HMM) for handwriting recognition. The HMM is enhanced by a statistical language model. Thus linguistic knowledge beyond the lexicon level is incorporated in the recognition process. Another novel feature of the system is that the HMM is applied in such a way that the difficult problem of segmenting a line of text into individual words is avoided. A number of experiments with various language models and large vocabularies have been conducted. The language models used in the system were also analytically compared based on their perplexity."

Easy access to such collections requires an index, which is currently created manually at great cost. Because automatic handwriting recognizers fail on historical manuscripts, the word spotting technique has been developed: the words in a collection are matched as images and grouped into clusters which contain all instances of the same word. By annotating \"interesting\" clusters, an index that links words to the locations where they occur can be built automatically. Due to the noise in historical documents, selecting the right features for matching words is crucial. We analyzed a range of features suitable for matching words using dynamic time warping (DTW), which aligns and compares sets of features extracted from two images. Each feature's individual performance was measured on a test set. With an average precision of 72%, a combination of features outperforms competing techniques in speed and precision."

They cannot deal with the lack of labeled data and would require extensive laboratory training for each individual script, style, language, and collection. We propose a biologically inspired whole-word recognition method that is used to incrementally elicit word labels in a live Web-based annotation system, named Monk. Since human labor should be minimized given the massive amount of image data, it becomes important to rely on robust perceptual mechanisms in the machine. Recent computational models of the neurophysiology of vision are applied to isolated word classification. A primate cortex-like mechanism allows us to classify text images that have a low frequency of occurrence. Typically, these images are the most difficult to retrieve and often contain named entities and are regarded as the most important to people. Usually, standard pattern-recognition technology cannot deal with these text images if there are not enough labeled instances. The results of this retrieval system are compared to normalized word-image matching and appear to be very promising."

By annotating \u201cinteresting\u201d clusters, an index that links words to the locations where they occur can be built automatically. Image similarities computed using a number of different techniques including dynamic time warping are compared. The word similarities are then used for clustering using both K-means and agglomerative clustering techniques.

Several experiments have been performed using both single and multiple writer data. Lexica of variable size (from 10,000 to 50,000 words) have been used. The use of language models is shown to improve the accuracy of the system (when the lexicon contains 50,000 words, the error rate is reduced by /spl sim/50 percent for single writer data and by /spl sim/25 percent for multiple writer data).

Three main components of the system are a word segmenter, a shape based matcher for words and a search interface. The user types in a query in English within a search window, the system finds the equivalent Arabic word, e.g., by dictionary look-up, locates word images in an indexed (segmented) set of documents. A two-step approach is employed in performing the search: (1) prototype selection: the query is used to obtain a set of handwritten samples of that word from a known set of writers (these are the prototypes), and (2) word matching: the prototypes are used to spot each occurrence of those words in the indexed document database. A ranking is performed on the entire set of test word images-- where the ranking criterion is a similarity score between each prototype word and the candidate words based on global word shape features. A database of 20,000 word images contained in 100 scanned handwritten Arabic documents written by 10 different writers was used to study retrieval performance. Using five writers for providing prototypes and the other five for testing, using manually segmented documents, 55% precision is obtained at 50% recall. Performance increases as more writers are used for training."

DuBois collection at the University of Massachusetts and the early Presidential libraries at the Library of Congress. Since Optical Character Recognition (OCR) does not work well on handwriting, an alternative scheme based on matching the images of the words is proposed for indexing such texts. The current paper deals with the matching aspects of this process. Two different techniques for matching words are discussed. The first method matches words assuming that the transformation between the words may be modelled by a translation (shift). The second method matches words assuming that the transformation between the words may be modelled by an affine transform. Experiments are shown demonstrating the feasibility of the approach for indexing handwriting. The method should also be applicable to retrieving previously stored material from personal digital assistants (PDAs)."

Convenient access to a collection requires an index, which is manually created at great labor and expense. Since current handwriting recognizers do not perform well on historical documents, a technique called word spotting has been developed: clusters with occurrences of the same word in a collection are established using image matching. By annotating \"interesting\" clusters, an index can be built automatically. We present an algorithm for matching handwritten words in noisy historical documents. The segmented word images are preprocessed to create sets of 1-dimensional features, which are then compared using dynamic time warping. We present experimental results on two different data sets from the George Washington collection. Our experiments show that this algorithm performs better and is faster than competing matching techniques."

The presented features are inspired by the SIFT keypoint descriptor, widely employed in computer vision and object recognition, but underexploited in the handwriting recognition field. In our approach, a sliding window moves from left to right over a word image. At each position, the window is subdivided into cells, and in each cell a histogram of orientations is accumulated. Experiments using two different word spotting systems hidden Markov models and dynamic time warping demonstrate a very significant improvement when using the proposed features with respect to the state-of-the-art ones."

A set of visual templates is used to define the keyword class of interest, and initiate a search for words exhibiting high shape similarity to the model set. Major problems of segmenting cursive script into individual words are avoided by applying line-oriented processing to the document pages. The use of profile-oriented features facilitates the application of dynamic programming techniques to pattern matching, and allows us to achieve high levels of recognition performance. Results of experiments with old Spanish manuscripts show a high recognition rate of the proposed approach."

First, a general principle of time-normalization is given using time-warping function. Then, two time-normalized distance definitions, called symmetric and asymmetric forms, are derived from the principle. These two forms are compared with each other through theoretical discussions and experimental studies. The symmetric form algorithm superiority is established. A new technique, called slope constraint, is successfully introduced, in which the warping function slope is restricted so as to improve discrimination between words in different categories. The effective slope constraint characteristic is qualitatively analyzed, and the optimum slope constraint condition is determined through experiments. The optimized algorithm is then extensively subjected to experimental comparison with various DP-algorithms, previously applied to spoken word recognition by different research groups. The experiment shows that the present algorithm gives no more than about two-thirds errors, even compared to the best conventional algorithm."

However, these archives remain inaccessible since manual transcription of such a huge volume is difficult. Automatic transcription is required, but due to the characteristics of Ottoman documents, character recognition based systems may not yield satisfactory results. It is also desirable to store the documents in image form since the documents may contain important drawings, especially the signatures. Due to these reasons, in this study we treat the problem as an image retrieval problem with the view that Ottoman words are images, and we propose a solution based on image matching techniques. The bag-of-visterms approach, which is shown to be successful to classify objects and scenes, is adapted for matching word images. Each word image is represented by a set of visual terms which are obtained by vector quantization of SIFT descriptors extracted from salient points. Similar words are then matched based on the similarity of the distributions of the visual terms. The experiments are carried out on printed and handwritten documents which included over 10,000 words. The results show that, the proposed system is able to retrieve words with high accuracies, and capture the semantic similarities between words."

The Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between two hidden Markov models (HMMs) would be particularly useful in the fields of speech and image recognition. Whereas the KL divergence is tractable for many distributions, including Gaussians, it is not in general tractable for mixture models or HMMs. Recently, variational approximations have been introduced to efficiently compute the KL divergence and Bhattacharyya divergence between two mixture models, by reducing them to the divergences between the mixture components. Here we generalize these techniques to approach the divergence between HMMs using a recursive backward algorithm. Two such methods are introduced, one of which yields an upper bound on the KL divergence, the other of which yields a recursive closed-form solution. The KL and Bhattacharyya divergences, as well as a weighted edit-distance technique, are evaluated for the task of predicting the confusability of pairs of words."

Several of these, such as the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and the Bhattacharyya divergence, are tractable for simple distributions such as Gaussians, but are intractable for more complex distributions such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) used in speech recognizers. For tasks related to classification error, the Bhattacharyya divergence is of special importance, due to its relationship with the Bayes error. Here we derive novel variational approximations to the Bhattacharyya divergence for HMMs. Remarkably the variational Bhattacharyya divergence can be computed in a simple closed-form expression for a given sequence length. One of the approximations can even be integrated over all possible sequence lengths in a closed-form expression. We apply the variational Bhattacharyya divergence for HMMs to word confusability, the problem of estimating the probability of mistaking one spoken word for another."

Several attempts have been made to improve dictionaries automatically, either by redefining pronunciations of words in terms of existing sound units, or by redefining the sound units themselves completely. The problem with these approaches is that, while the former is limited by the sound units used, the latter discards all human information that has been incorporated into an expert-designed recognition dictionary. In this paper we propose a new merging-and-splitting algorithm that attempts to redefine the basic sound units used in the dictionary, while maintaining the expert knowledge built into a manually designed dictionary. Sound units from an existing dictionary are merged based on their inherent confusability, as measured by a Monte-Carlo based metric, and subsequently split to maximize the likelihood of the training data. Experiments with the Resource Management database indicate that this approach results in an improvement in recognition accuracy when context-independent models are used for recognition. When context-dependent models are used, the improvement observed is reduced."

Manual transcription and publication of such documents is unlikely, and automatic transcription with high enough accuracy to support a traditional text search is difficult. In this work we describe a lexicon-free system for performing text queries on off-line printed and handwritten Arabic documents. Our segmentation-based approach utilizes gHMMs with a bigram letter transition model, and KPCA/LDA for letter discrimination. The segmentation stage is integrated with inference. We show that our method is robust to varying letter forms, ligatures, and overlaps. Additionally, we find that ignoring letters beyond the adjoining neighbors has little effect on inference and localization, which leads to a significant performance increase over standard dynamic programming. Finally, we discuss an extension to perform batch searches of large word lists for indexing purposes."

Once trained, the internals of these models are considered opaque; there is no effort to interpret the hidden states. We show that by minimizing the entropy of the joint distribution, an HMM's internal state machine can be made to organize observed activity into meaningful states. This has uses in video monitoring and annotation, low bit-rate coding of scene activity, and detection of anomalous behavior. We demonstrate with models of office activity and outdoor traffic, showing how the framework learns principal modes of activity and patterns of activity change. We then show how this framework can be adapted to infer hidden state from extremely ambiguous images, in particular, inferring 3D body orientation and pose from sequences of low-resolution silhouettes."

Therefore, the conventional OCR method, which uses segmentation, does not work well. Our method instead divides the text image into a sequence of small slits. The image region that corresponds to the query image region is retrieved by solving the matching problem of these sequences. Applying the eigenspace method to the slit images enables us to solve the matching problem efficiently. Moreover, using dynamic time warping (DTW) further improves the results. Our method has higher accuracy than the simple template matching method, and it has far higher efficiency in computational cost."

The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. The result is that retrieved is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of Google. The method is illustrated for matching in two full length feature films."

We converted conventional multi-dimensional descriptors into pseudo-codes which have a property that: if two vectors are near in the original space then encoded pseudo-codes are 'semi equivalent with high probability. For this conversion, we combined locality sensitive hashing (LSH) indices and at the same time we also developed a new family of LSH functions that is superior to earlier ones when all vectors are constrained to lie on the surface of the unit sphere. Word spotting based on our pseudo-code becomes faster than multi-dimensional descriptor-based method while it scarcely degrades the accuracy."

An eigenspace decomposition of high-dimensional trajectory data leads to very compact representation, which is then used as indexing structure. To cutback on PCA computation during indexing, we first segment the trajectories into atomic subtrajectories using a curvature zero-crossing based approach followed by clustering of these subtrajectories. A two-level PCA operation with coarse-to-fine retrieval for query trajectory is then performed to generate retrieval results. Our experimental results show that our global PCA based approach performs better when input query trajectory is of similar length compared to the matching trajectories in the database. However, when partial trajectories are posed as queries our segmented trajectory based approach provides superior results for all precision-recall ratios."

A generalized HMM is fitted, using transcribed latin to obtain a transition model and one example each of 22 letters to obtain an emission model. We show results for unigram, bigram and trigram models. Our method transcribes 25 pages of a manuscript of Terence with fair accuracy (75% of letters correctly transcribed). Search results are very strong; we use examples of variant spellings to demonstrate that the search respects the ink of the document. Furthermore, our model produces fair searches on a document from which we obtained no training data."

Availability of electronic imaging tools and effective image processing techniques makes it feasible to process the multimedia data in large databases. A framework for content-based retrieval of historical documents in the Ottoman Empire archives is presented. The documents are stored as textual images, which are compressed by constructing a library of symbols occurring in a document, and the symbols in the original image are then replaced with pointers into the codebook to obtain a compressed representation of the image. The features in wavelet and spatial domains, based on angular and distance span of shapes, are used to extract the symbols. In order to make content-based retrieval in the historical archives, a query is specified as a rectangular region in an input image and the same symbol-extraction process is applied to the query region. The queries are processed on the codebook of documents and the query images are identified in the resulting documents using the pointers in the textual images. The query process does not require decompression of images. The new content-based retrieval framework is also applicable to many other document archives using different scripts."

The proposed methods are utilized for image retrieval tasks. Continuous probabilistic image modeling based on mixtures of Gaussians together with KL measure for image similarity, can be used for image retrieval tasks with remarkable performance. The efficiency and the performance of the KL approximation methods proposed are demonstrated on both simulated data and real image data sets.

In the probability product kernel, data points in the input space are mapped to distributions over the sample space and a general inner product is then evaluated as the integral of the product of pairs of distributions. The kernel is straightforward to evaluate for all exponential family models such as multinomials and Gaussians and yields interesting nonlinear kernels. Furthermore, the kernel is computable in closed form for latent distributions such as mixture models, hidden Markov models and linear dynamical systems. For intractable models, such as switching linear dynamical systems, structured mean-field approximations can be brought to bear on the kernel evaluation. For general distributions, even if an analytic expression for the kernel is not feasible, we show a straightforward sampling method to evaluate it. Thus, the kernel permits discriminative learning methods, including support vector machines, to exploit the properties, metrics and invariances of the generative models we infer from each datum. Experiments are shown using multinomial models for text, hidden Markov models for biological data sets and linear dynamical systems for time series data."

In contrast, we consider multiple sets of sequences where we group sets associated with the same motif into a cluster, assuming that each set involves a single motif. Clustering sets of sequences yields clusters of coherent motifs, improving signal-to-noise ratio or enabling us to identify multiple motifs. We present a probabilistic model for DNA motif discovery where we identify multiple motifs through searching for patterns which are shared across multiple sets of sequences. Our model infers cluster-indicating latent variables and learns motifs simultaneously, where these two tasks interact with each other. We show that our model can handle various motif discovery problems, depending on how to construct multiple sets of sequences. Experiments on three different problems for discovering DNA motifs emphasize the useful behavior and confirm the substantial gains over existing methods where only a single set of sequences is considered."

While spectral clustering of vector inputs is straightforward, extensions to structured data or time-series data remain less explored. This paper proposes a clustering method for time-series data that couples non-parametric spectral clustering with parametric hidden Markov models (HMMs). HMMs add some beneficial structural and parametric assumptions such as Markov properties and hidden state variables which are useful for clustering. This article shows that using probabilistic pairwise kernel estimates between parametric models provides improved experimental results for unsupervised clustering and visualization of real and synthetic datasets. Results are compared with a fully parametric baseline method (a mixture of hidden Markov models) and a non-parametric baseline method (spectral clustering with non-parametric time-series kernels)."

Recent work has explored ways to embed high-dimensional features or complex distance functions into a low-dimensional Hamming space where items can be efficiently searched. However, existing methods do not apply for high-dimensional kernelized data when the underlying feature embedding for the kernel is unknown. We show how to generalize locality-sensitive hashing to accommodate arbitrary kernel functions, making it possible to preserve the algorithm's sub-linear time similarity search guarantees for a wide class of useful similarity functions. Since a number of successful image-based kernels have unknown or incomputable embeddings, this is especially valuable for image retrieval tasks. We validate our technique on several large-scale datasets, and show that it enables accurate and fast performance for example-based object classification, feature matching, and content-based retrieval."

Different from previous methods, our approach makes use of online handwriting instead of handwritten images for registration. The online registrations enable robust recovery of the writing trajectory from an input offline signature and thus allow effective shape matching between registration and verification signatures. In addition, we propose several new techniques to improve the performance of the new signature verification system: 1. we formulate and solve the recovery of writing trajectory within the framework of conditional random fields; 2. we propose a new shape descriptor, online context, for aligning signatures; 3. we develop a verification criterion which combines the duration and amplitude variances of handwriting. Experiments on a benchmark database show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the well-known offline signature verification methods and achieve comparable performance with online signature verification methods."

For extended sites, the system will require multiple cameras. Thus, key elements of the system are motion tracking, camera coordination, activity classification, and event detection. In this paper, we focus on motion tracking and show how one can use observed motion to learn patterns of activity in a site. Motion segmentation is based on an adaptive background subtraction method that models each pixel as a mixture of Gaussians and uses an online approximation to update the model. The Gaussian distributions are then evaluated to determine which are most likely to result from a background process. This yields a stable, real-time outdoor tracker that reliably deals with lighting changes, repetitive motions from clutter, and long-term scene changes. While a tracking system is unaware of the identity of any object it tracks, the identity remains the same for the entire tracking sequence. Our system leverages this information by accumulating joint co-occurrences of the representations within a sequence. These joint co-occurrence statistics are then used to create a hierarchical binary-tree classification of the representations. This method is useful for classifying sequences, as well as individual instances of activities in a site."

We propose a method for unsupervised, multi-attribute learning of a model of moving object tracks that enables fast reasoning about new tracks, both partial and complete. We group object tracks using spectral clustering and estimate the spectral embedding efficiently from a sample of tracks using the Nystrom approximation. Clusters are modeled as Gaussians in the embedding space and new tracks are projected into the embedding space and matched with the cluster models to detect anomalies. We show results on a week of data from a busy urban scene."

For each vehicle, its dimension and initial position are robustly given by the vehicle detection algorithm, and a separate tracking algorithm is used to extract the vehicle\u2019s trajectory from the images of multiple cameras. The algorithms overcome the limitations of machine vision algorithms previously proposed that have difficulty to robustly obtain accurate vehicle positions in the presence of shadows and occlusions. Using the system, we generated a prototype dataset of over 4,700 individual vehicles, or 2.8M data points, which is the largest and most comprehensive dataset on vehicle trajectories ever produced."
