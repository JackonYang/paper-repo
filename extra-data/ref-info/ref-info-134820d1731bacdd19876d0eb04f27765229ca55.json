Based on string class probability approximation, the proposed method evaluates the likelihood of candidate segmentation\u2013recognition paths by combining the scores of character recognition, unary and binary geometric features, as well as linguistic context. The path evaluation criterion can flexibly combine the scores of various contexts and is insensitive to the variability in path length, and so, the optimal segmentation path with its string class can be effectively found by Viterbi search. Moreover, the model parameters are estimated by the genetic algorithm so as to optimize the holistic string recognition performance. In experiments on horizontal text lines extracted from the TUAT Kondate database, the proposed method achieves the segmentation rate of 0.9934 that corresponds to a f-measure and the character recognition rate of 92.80%."

This paper summarizes our recent efforts on offline handwritten Chinese script recognition using a segmentation-driven approach. We address two essential problems, namely isolated character recognition and establishment of the probabilistic segmentation model. To improve the isolated character recognition accuracy, we propose a heteroscedastic linear discriminant analysis algorithm to extract more discrimination information from original character features, and implement a minimum classification error learning scheme to optimize classifier parameters. In the segmentation stage, information from three different sources, namely geometric layout, character recognition confidence, and semantic model are integrated into a probabilistic framework to give the best script interpretation. Experimental results on postal address and bank check recognition have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms: A more than 80% correct recognition rate is achieved on 1,000 handwritten Chinese address items, and the recognition reliability of bank checks is largely improved after combining courtesy amount recognition result with legal amount recognition result. Some preliminary research work on Arabic script recognition is also shown."

The optimal path, giving segmentation and recognition result, is found using a pruned dynamic programming search method. We evaluate various language models, including the character-based n-gram, word-based n-gram, and hybrid n-gram models.

In this paper, we systematically analyze the key factors that have an impact on the performance of contextual post-processing: statistical language models (LMs), candidate confidence, candidate set size, and search strategy. We then present a hybrid post-processing system, which integrates various kinds of information available. Next, we investigate seven LMs, four estimation methods of candidate confidence and different size of candidate set, and illustrate their influence on the performance of contextual post-processing in detail. Experimental results justify that the performance of the LMs are affected by training corpora size, smoothing method, and model pruning, and that lower perplexity correlates with a high accuracy. Comparing different estimation methods of candidate confidence shows that, it is vital to the contextual post-processing. We also show that allowing the correct characters to be captured in a limited number of candidates is extremely important for obtaining good post-processing performance. By adopting the hybrid post-processing, we can obtain high accuracy while paying attention to post-processing speed and memory space at the same time. It is shown that the average recognition accuracy of three Chinese scripts (about 66,000 characters in total) can reach 97.65%, which means 87% error correction rate in comparison with the 81.58% average accuracy before post-processing. In the end, we give some proposals for choosing a proper post-processing method for real script recognition tasks."

First, a dissection algorithm is applied to over-segment string image into radical series so that the correct segmentation could be achieved by merging those radicals according to the correct merging path. Then, the method synthesizes layout analysis, isolated character classifier and bi-gram language model to find the best merging path and the best recognition result. The classifier used in this paper will give every isolated character image ten recognition candidates, each with corresponding recognition confidence. The parameter of bi-gram model is obtained from address database which contains more than one hundred thousand address items. In experiments on 946 mail images, the proposed method achieves correct rate of 87.2 percent"

The address phrases are recognized as a whole because there is no extra space between words. The lexicon contains 111,349 address phrases, which are stored in a trie structure. In recognition, the text line image is matched with the lexicon entries (phrases) to obtain reliable segmentation and retrieve valid address phrases. The paper first introduces some effective techniques for text line image preprocessing and presegmentation. In presegmentation, the text line image is separated into primitive segments by connected component analysis and touching pattern splitting based on contour shape analysis. In lexicon matching, consecutive segments are dynamically combined into candidate character patterns. An accurate character classifier is embedded in lexicon matching to select characters matched with a candidate pattern from a dynamic category set. A beam search strategy is used to control the lexicon matching so as to achieve real-time recognition. In experiments on 3,589 live mail images, the proposed method achieved correct rate of 83.68 percent while the error rate is less than 1 percent."

The classifier outputs are transformed to confidence values in three confidence types, namely, sigmoid, soft max and Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence (D-S evidence). The confidence parameters are optimized by minimizing the cross-entropy (CE) loss function (both binary and multi-class) on a validation dataset, where we add non-character samples to enhance the outlier rejection capability in text recognition. Experimental results on the CASIA-HWDB database show that confidence transformation improves the handwritten text recognition performance significantly and adding non-characters for confidence parameter estimation is beneficial. Among the confidence types, the D-S evidence performs best."

In this process, a Chinese text line is first pre-segmented into a sequence of radicals, which are then merged according to a cost function combining both recognition confidence and contextual cost. Two strategies are also proposed for implementation: bi-gram based merging and lexicon driven merging. In the former one, we generate a set of merging paths which are then evaluated by Viterbi algorithm. The radicals\u2019 best merging method is given by the path with the highest score. In the latter strategy, a lexicon is preset and compared with the radicals to determine both radicals\u2019 merging and candidate character selection. Experiments show that contextual information plays a crucial role in Chinese character segmentation and could obviously improve the segmentation and recognition results."

This three-stage hybrid post-processing system reduces the misclassification and rejection rates common in the single character recognition phase. The proposed system is novel in two respects: first, it reduces the misclassification rate by applying a dictionary-look-up strategy that bind the candidate characters into a word-lattice and appends the linguistic-prone characters into the candidate set; second, it identifies promising sentences by employing a distant Chinese word BI-Gram model with a maximum distance of three to select plausible words from the word-lattice. These sentences are then output as the upgraded result. Compared with one of our previous works in single Chinese character recognition, the proposed system improves absolute recognition rates by 12%."

The model evaluates the likelihood composed of character segmentation, character recognition, character pattern structure and context. The likelihood of character pattern structure considers the plausible height, width and inner gaps within a character pattern that appear in Chinese characters composed of multiple radicals (subpatterns). The recognition system incorporating this model separates freely written text into text line elements, estimates the average character size of each element, hypothetically segments it into characters using geometric features, applies character recognition to segmented patterns and employs the model to search the text interpretation that maximizes likelihood as Japanese text. We show the effectiveness of the model through recognition experiments and clarify how the newly modeled factors in the likelihood affect the overall recognition rate."

This chapter reviews the major methods of normalization and feature extraction and evaluates their performance experimentally. The normalization methods include linear normalization, nonlinear normalization (NLN) based on line density equalization, moment normalization (MN), bi-moment normalization (BMN), modified centroid-boundary alignment (MCBA), and their pseudo-two-dimensional (pseudo 2D) extensions. As to feature extraction, I focus on some effective variations of direction features: chaincode feature, normalization-cooperated chaincode feature (NCCF), and gradient feature. The features are compared with various resolutions of direction and zoning, and are combined with various normalization methods. In experiments, the current methods have shown superior performance on handprinted characters, but are insufficient applied to unconstrained handwriting."

We evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art pattern classifiers of this kind. First, we build a baseline numeral string recognition system with simple but effective presegmentation. The classification scores of the candidate patterns generated by presegmentation are combined to evaluate the segmentation paths and the optimal path is found using the beam search strategy. Three neural classifiers, two discriminative density models, and two support vector classifiers are evaluated. Each classifier has some variations depending on the training strategy: maximum likelihood, discriminative learning both with and without noncharacter samples. The string recognition performances are evaluated on the numeral string images of the NIST special database 19 and the zipcode images of the CEDAR CDROM-1. The results show that noncharacter training is crucial for neural classifiers and support vector classifiers, whereas, for the discriminative density models, the regularization of parameters is important. The string recognition results compare favorably to the best ones reported in the literature though we totally ignored the geometric context. The best results were obtained using a support vector classifier, but the neural classifiers and discriminative density models show better trade-off between accuracy and computational overhead."

In this paper, a two-stage character segmentation algorithm according to the characteristics of handwritten mail address characters is proposed. In the simple segmentation stage, the block sequence is extracted from the mail address image using the structure-based methods, including projection profile analysis, connected components analysis and stroke cross number analysis. In the precise segmentation stage, all candidate segmentation paths are created by combining the neighboring blocks and represented with a candidate segmentation graph first. Then several optimal candidate paths are selected from the graph by dynamic programming searching based on recognition confidence. Finally the best segmentation path is determined by matching these paths with the known post address database. In the experiment on more than 500 real envelop images with the this approach, the correct sorting rate of address recognition is up to 79.46% and that of address-postcode integrated recognition is up to 96.26%."

Because of its unique technical challenges and great social needs, the last four decades witnessed the intensive research in this field and a rapid increase of successful applications. However, higher recognition performance is continuously needed to improve the existing applications and to exploit new applications. This paper first provides an overview of Chinese character recognition and the properties of Chinese characters. Some important methods and successful results in the history of Chinese character recognition are then summarized. As for classification methods, this article pays special attention to the syntactic-semantic approach for online Chinese character recognition, as well as the metasynthesis approach for discipline crossing.

It was considered as an extremely difficult problem due to the very large number of categories, complicated structures, similarity between characters, and the variability of fonts or writing styles. Because of its unique technical challenges and great social needs, the last four decades witnessed the intensive research in this field and a rapid increase of successful applications. However, higher recognition performance is continuously needed to improve the existing applications and to exploit new applications. This paper first provides an overview of Chinese character recognition and the properties of Chinese characters. Some important methods and successful results in the history of Chinese character recognition are then summarized. As for classification methods, this article pays special attention to the syntactic-semantic approach for online Chinese character recognition, as well as the metasynthesis approach for discipline crossing. Finally, the remaining problems and the possible solutions are discussed."

Handwritten text alignment is prone to errors due to the difficulty of character segmentation and the variability of character shape, size and position. In this paper, we propose to incorporate the geometric context of character strings to improve the alignment accuracy for offline handwritten Chinese documents. We use four statistical models to evaluate the geometric features of single characters and between-character relationships. By combining the geometric models with a character recognizer, we have achieved a large improvement of alignment accuracy in our experiments on unconstrained handwritten Chinese text lines."

We give a string evaluation criterion for better integrating the multiple scores while overcoming the effect of string length variability. For measuring geometric context, we propose a statistical method for modeling both single- character and between-character plausibility. Our experimental results on TUAT HANDS databases show that the geometric context improves the character segmentation accuracy remarkably."

Such reduction is vital to increasing the speed of such applications as Kanji address recognition. Further, it also reduces the probability of misreadings in linguistic postprocessing. First, we define a confidence value by which we can express the potential correctness of recognition candidates. Next, we define \"accumulated confidence value\" and use it as a measure to express a threshold for candidate acceptance in Kanji character recognition. The efficiency of the proposed method is evaluated in an experiment using IPTP CD-ROM2 Japanese address images. Results show that a roughly 31% reduction in the number of candidates was obtained without reducing the number of correct candidates."

This paper first describes the failed application of neural network - hidden Markov model hybrid recognizer on Chinese bank check legal amount recognition, and explains the reasons for the failure: the neural network - hidden Markov model hybrid recognizer cannot handle the complexity in the training for Chinese legal amounts. Then a spiral recognition methodology is presented. This methodology enables the system to increase its recognition power (both the recognition rate and the number of recognized characters) during the training iterations. Some experiments were done to show that the spiral recognition methodology has a high performance in the recognition of unconstrained handwritten Chinese legal amounts. The recognition rate at the character level is 93.5%, and the recognition rate at the legal amount level is 60%. Combined with the recognition of courtesy amount, the overall error rate is less than 1%."

The samples were produced by 1,020 writers using Anoto pen on papers for obtaining both online trajectory data and offline images. Both the online samples and offline samples are divided into six datasets, three for isolated characters (DB1.0-C1.2) and three for handwritten texts (DB2.0-C2.2). The (either online or offline) datasets of isolated characters contain about 3.9 million samples of 7,356 classes (7,185 Chinese characters and 171 symbols), and the datasets of handwritten texts contain about 5,090 pages and 1.35 million character samples. Each dataset is segmented and annotated at character level, and is partitioned into standard training and test subsets. The online and offline databases can be used for the research of various handwritten document analysis tasks."

To alleviate the effect of stroke direction distortion caused by shape normalization and provide higher recognition accuracies, we propose a new feature extraction approach, called normalization-cooperated gradient feature (NCGF) extraction, which maps the gradient direction elements of original image to direction planes without generating the normalized image and can be combined with various normalization methods. Experiments on handwritten Japanese and Chinese character databases show that, compared to normalization-based gradient feature, the NCGF reduces the recognition error rate by factors ranging from 8.63 percent to 14.97 percent with high confidence of significance when combined with pseudo-two-dimensional normalization."

It is effective especially in character recognition with the over-segmentation process. The method is based on the credibility measurement of each presegmented pattern for being a true character by analyzing peripheral features such as gaps between patterns and widths and heights of patterns. A heuristic statistical method is applied to the analysis. Experimental results show that the developed method increases the accuracy of character segmentation. It is effective especially when no linguistic feedback to segmentation is available and/or the character classifier ability is not high enough. In such cases, the recognition accuracy is increased from 30% to 70% by the new segmentation method."

The only assumption made about the data is that it is written in English. This allows the application of statistical language models in order to improve the performance of our system. Several experiments have been performed using both single and multiple writer data. Lexica of variable size (from 10,000 to 50,000 words) have been used. The use of language models is shown to improve the accuracy of the system (when the lexicon contains 50,000 words, the error rate is reduced by /spl sim/50 percent for single writer data and by /spl sim/25 percent for multiple writer data). Our approach is described in detail and compared with other methods presented in the literature to deal with the same problem. An experimental setup to correctly deal with unconstrained text recognition is proposed."

The proposed method is applicable to a wide variety of distance metrics and experiments on Euclidean distance and city block distance have achieved promising results. By confidence evaluation, the distribution of distances is analyzed to derive the probabilities of classes in two steps: output probability evaluation and input probability inference. Using the input probabilities as confidences, several selection rules have been tested and the rule that selects the classes with high confidence ratio to the first rank class produced best results. The experiments were implemented on the ETL9B database and the results show that the proposed method selects about one-fourth as many candidates with accuracy preserved compared to the conventional method that selects a fixed number of candidates."

A new segmentation algorithm based on mathematical morphology is used to translate the 2-D image into a 1-D sequence of sub-character symbols. This sequence of symbols is modeled by the CDVDHMM. Generally, there are two information sources associated with the written text. While the shape information of each character symbol is modeled as a mixture Gaussian distribution, the linguistic knowledge, i.e., constraint, is modeled as a Markov chain. In this context, the variable duration state is used to take care of the segmentation ambiguity among the consecutive characters. Some experimental results are described to demonstrate the success of the proposed scheme.<<ETX>>"

We focus especially on errors due to out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. First, word posterior probabilities are computed and used to detect error hypotheses on output sentences. An SVM classifier allows these errors to be categorized according to defined types. Then, a post-processing step is performed using a language model based on Part-of-Speech (POS) tags which is combined to the n-gram model previously used. Thus, error hypotheses can be further recognized and POS tags can be assigned to the OOV words. Experiments on on-line handwritten sentences show that the proposed approach allows a significant reduction of the word error rate."

                "text": "The minimum classification error (MCE) framework for discriminative training is a simple and general formalism for directly optimizing recognition accuracy in pattern recognition problems. The framework applies directly to the optimization of hidden Markov models (HMMs) used for speech recognition problems. However, few if any studies have reported results for the application of MCE training to large-vocabulary, continuous-speech recognition tasks. This article reports significant gains in recognition performance and model compactness as a result of discriminative training based on MCE training applied to HMMs, in the context of three challenging large-vocabulary (up to 100 k word) speech recognition tasks: the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese lecture speech transcription task, a telephone-based name recognition task, and the MIT Jupiter telephone-based conversational weather information task. On these tasks, starting from maximum likelihood (ML) baselines, MCE training yielded relative reductions in word error ranging from 7% to 20%. Furthermore, this paper evaluates the use of different methods for optimizing the MCE criterion function, as well as the use of precomputed recognition lattices to speed up training. An overview of the MCE framework is given, with an emphasis on practical implementation issues"

In this paper, we discuss the issue of speech recognizer training from a broad perspective with root in the classical Bayes decision theory. We differentiate the method of classifier design by way of distribution estimation and the discriminative method of minimizing classification error rate based on the fact that in many realistic applications, such as speech recognition, the real signal distribution form is rarely known precisely. We argue that traditional methods relying on distribution estimation are suboptimal when the assumed distribution form is not the true one, and that \"optimality\" in distribution estimation does not automatically translate into \"optimality\" in classifier design. We compare the two different methods in the context of hidden Markov modeling for speech recognition. We show the superiority of the minimum classification error (MCE) method over the distribution estimation method by providing the results of several key speech recognition experiments. In general, the MCE method provides a significant reduction of recognition error rate."

The complexity is mainly affected by the poor quality and the small quantity of the data available. In this paper we apply an HMM based recognition system to medieval manuscripts from the 13th century written in Middle High German. The recognition system, which was originally developed for modern scripts, has been adapted to medieval scripts. Beside the data processing, one of the major challenges is to create a suitable language model. Because of the lack of appropriate independent text corpora for medieval languages, the language model has to be created on the base of a rather small number of manuscripts only. Due to the small size of the corpus, optimizing the language model parameters can quickly lead to the problem of overfitting. In this paper we describe a strategy to integrate all available information into the language model and to optimize the language model parameters without suffering from this problem."

In this approach, character prediction substitutes for rough classification which occupies a large part of the recognition time. Three character prediction methods are proposed and prediction capability is verified. This method is implemented in a recognition system to evaluate its performance. Accuracy is compared with the result of the postprocessing error correction method. As a result, it is observed that the predictive recognition method has a considerable speed advantage. For almost the same recognition accuracy, this method is 20% faster.<<ETX>>"

                "text": "In this article, we studied the objective functions of MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE for discriminative learning in sequential pattern recognition. We presented an approach that unifies the objective functions of MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE in a common rational-function form of (25). The exact structure of the rational-function form for each discriminative criterion was derived and studied. While the rational-function form of MMI has been known in the past, we provided the theoretical proof that the similar rational-function form exists for the objective functions of MCE and MPE/MWE. Moreover, we showed that the rational function forms for objective functions of MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE differ in the constant weighting factors CDT (s1 . . . sR) and these weighting factors depend only on the labeled sequence s1 . . . sR, and are independent of the parameter set - to be optimized. The derived rational-function form for MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE allows the GT/EBW-based parameter optimization framework to be applied directly in discriminative learning. In the past, lack of the appropriate rational-function form was a difficulty for MCE and MPE/MWE, because without this form, the GT/EBW-based parameter optimization framework cannot be directly applied. Based on the unified rational-function form, in a tutorial style, we derived the GT/EBW-based parameter optimization formulas for both discrete HMMs and CDHMMs in discriminative learning using MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE criteria. The unifying review provided in this article has been based upon a large number of earlier contributions that have been cited and discussed throughout the article. Here we provide a brief summary of such background work. Extension to large-scale speech recognition tasks was accomplished in the work of [59] and [60]. The dissertation of [47] further improved the MMI criterion to that of MPE/MWE. In a parallel vein, the work of [20] provided an alternative approach to that of [41], with an attempt to more rigorously provide a CDHMM model re-estimation formula that gives positive growth of the MMI objective function. A crucial error of this attempt was corrected in [2] for establishing an existence proof of such positive growth. The main goal of this article is to provide an underlying foundation for MMI, MCE, and MPE/MWE at the objective function level to facilitate the development of new parameter optimization techniques and to incorporate other pattern recognition concepts, e.g., discriminative margins [66], into the current discriminative learning paradigm."

The MQDF2 is a variation of the MQDF1 to save the required computation time and storage. Two discriminant functions were applied to Chinese character recognition to evaluate their effectiveness, and remarkable improvement was observed in their performance."

There are two reasons why this has occurred. First, the dynamic programming strategy can be combined with a very efficient and practical pruning strategy so that very large search spaces can be handled. Second, the dynamic programming strategy has turned out to be extremely flexible in adapting to new requirements. Examples of such requirements are the lexical tree organization of the pronunciation lexicon and the generation of a word graph instead of the single best sentence. We attempt to review the use of dynamic programming search strategies for large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR). The following methods are described in detail: searching using a lexical tree, language-model look-ahead and word-graph generation."

In order to enjoy this reduction, some assumptions about the structure of the type of evidence represented and combined must be made The assumption made here is that each piece of the evidence either confirms or denies a single proposition rather than a disjunction For any domain in which the assumption is justified the savings are available."
