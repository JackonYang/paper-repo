In this paper, we show that this phenomenon is related to the distribution of margins of the training examples with respect to the generated voting classification rule, where the margin of an example is simply the difference between the number of correct votes and the maximum number of votes received by any incorrect label. We show that techniques used in the analysis of Vapnik's support vector classifiers and of neural networks with small weights can be applied to voting methods to relate the margin distribution to the test error. We also show theoretically and experimentally that boosting is especially effective at increasing the margins of the training examples. Finally, we compare our explanation to those based on the bias-variance"

These classiers are in the form of a majority vote over a number of decision trees. Unfortunately, these classi ers are often large, complex and di\u00c6cult to interpret. This paper describes a new type of classi cation rule, the alternating decision tree, which is a generalization of decision trees, voted decision trees and voted decision stumps. At the same time classi ers of this type are relatively easy to interpret. We present a learning algorithm for alternating decision trees that is based on boosting. Experimental results show it is competitive with boosted decision tree algorithms such as C5.0, and generates rules that are usually smaller in size and thus easier to interpret. In addition these rules yield a natural measure of classi cation con dence which can be used to improve the accuracy at the cost of abstaining from predicting examples that are hard to classify."

This boosting algorithm is an adaptive version of the boost by majority algorithm and combines bounded goals of the boost by majority algorithm with the adaptivity of AdaBoost.The method used for making boost-by-majority adaptive is to consider the limit in which each of the boosting iterations makes an infinitesimally small contribution to the process as a whole. This limit can be modeled using the differential equations that govern Brownian motion. The new boosting algorithm, named BrownBoost, is based on finding solutions to these differential equations.The paper describes two methods for finding approximate solutions to the differential equations. The first is a method that results in a provably polynomial time algorithm. The second method, based on the Newton-Raphson minimization procedure, is much more efficient in practice but is not known to be polynomial."
