This gives us a model of the individual, which is then texture mapped using the original photograph to generate the final view.

The geometric configuration is first extracted by fitting a deformable template to the shape of the feature (for example, an eye) in the image. This information is then used to geometrically normalize the image in such a way that the feature in the image attains a standard shape. The normalized image of the facial feature is then classified in terms of a set of principal components previously obtained from a representative set of training images of similar features. This classification stage yields a representation vector which can be used for recognition matching of the feature in terms of image detail alone without the complication of changes in facial expression. Implementation of the system is described and results are given for its application to a set of test faces. These results show that features can be reliably recognized using the representation vectors obtained.<<ETX>>"

First, we find that the opposition of positive and negative point contributions for nearly all the eigenvectors forms head/hair shapes, often containing the positions and shapes of eyes. Second, the opposition of positive and negative points that contribute strongly to the determination of the first eigenvector appear to separate male and female head/hair shapes. We find also that pixel positions that contribute strongly to the eigenvectors generally form spatially contiguous groups in the face pattern, often form face/head shapes, and occasionally consist of points that form a hairstyle.

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture."

Following Brennan (1982; 1985). caricatures were produced by first comparing the position of facial features in a frame-grabbed image with the average position for a series of faces; deviations from the average were then accentuated by a constant fraction (16, 32 or 48%). Photographic quality caricatures for seven famous faces were generated by distorting regions of the original images in accordance with the change in feature positions. Images reducing the distinctiveness of faces (anticaricatures) were produced by decreasing deviations from the norm. In Experiment 1, perceptual ratings of the degree to which images resembled the individuals depicted was found to vary with the degree of caricaturing (\u221232, \u221216, 0, +16, +32%). Interpolation from the data indicated that the best likeness occurred for images with a small degre..."

The limits of applicability of the algorithms are also traced by making the optical degradations more and more severe until the algorithms no longer succeed in their task.

The behaviour of the system is established by a learning process whereby a representative set of patterns from the class of data to be recognised, is input to the machine. A wide range of pattern recognition problems can be solved with this approach, they include industrial inspection, speech recognition, medical pattern recognition and artificial vision."

Shih 2009-03-23 In the development of digital multimedia, the importance and impact of image processing and mathematical morphology are well documented in areas ranging from automated vision detection and inspection to object recognition, image analysis and pattern recognition. Those working in these ever-evolving fields require a solid grasp of basic fundamentals, theory, and related applications\u2014and few books can provide the unique tools for learning contained in this text. Image Processing and Mathematical Morphology: Fundamentals and Applications is a comprehensive, wide-ranging overview of morphological mechanisms and techniques and their relation to image processing. More than merely a tutorial on vital technical information, the book places this knowledge into a theoretical framework. This helps readers analyze key principles and architectures and then use the author\u2019s novel ideas on implementation of advanced algorithms to formulate a practical and detailed plan to develop and foster their own ideas. The book: Presents the history and state-of-the-art techniques related to image morphological processing, with numerous practical examples Gives readers a clear tutorial on complex technology and other tools that rely on their intuition for a clear understanding of the subject Includes an updated bibliography and useful graphs and illustrations Examines several new algorithms in great detail so that readers can adapt them to derive their own solution approaches This invaluable reference helps readers assess and simplify problems and their essential requirements and complexities, giving them all the necessary data and methodology to master current theoretical developments and applications, as well as create new ones."

                "text": "This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."
