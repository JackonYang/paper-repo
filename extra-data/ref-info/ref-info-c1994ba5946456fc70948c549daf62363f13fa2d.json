In this paper, we use this data to build 3D point clouds of full indoor scenes such as an office and address the task of semantic labeling of these 3D point clouds. We propose a graphical model that captures various features and contextual relations, including the local visual appearance and shape cues, object co-occurence relationships and geometric relationships. With a large number of object classes and relations, the model's parsimony becomes important and we address that by using multiple types of edge potentials. The model admits efficient approximate inference, and we train it using a maximum-margin learning approach. In our experiments over a total of 52 3D scenes of homes and offices (composed from about 550 views, having 2495 segments labeled with 27 object classes), we get a performance of 84.06% in labeling 17 object classes for offices, and 73.38% in labeling 17 object classes for home scenes. Finally, we applied these algorithms successfully on a mobile robot for the task of finding objects in large cluttered rooms."

In this paper, we propose an algorithm to recover the occlusion boundaries and depth ordering of free-standing structures in the scene. Rather than viewing the problem as one of pure image processing, our approach employs cues from an estimated surface layout and applies Gestalt grouping principles using a conditional random field (CRF) model. We propose a hierarchical segmentation process, based on agglomerative merging, that re-estimates boundary strength as the segmentation progresses. Our experiments on the Geometric Context dataset validate our choices for features, our iterative refinement of classifiers, and our CRF model. In experiments on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset, PASCAL VOC 2008, and LabelMe, we also show that the trained algorithm generalizes to other datasets and can be used as an object boundary predictor with figure/ground labels."

Such a database is useful for a variety of applications, including training systems for object detection and validation of 3D output. We build such a database from images that have been annotated with only the identity of objects and their spatial extent in images. Important for this task is the recovery of geometric information that is implicit in the object labels, such as qualitative relationships between objects (attachment, support, occlusion) and quantitative ones (inferring camera parameters). We describe a model that integrates cues extracted from the object labels to infer the implicit geometric information. We show that we are able to obtain high quality 3D information by evaluating the proposed approach on a database obtained with a laser range scanner. Finally, given the database of 3D scenes, we show how it can find better scene matches for an unlabeled image by expanding the database through viewpoint interpolation to unseen views."

We evaluate our method both quantitatively and qualitatively on the challenging Cambridge-driving Labeled Video Database (CamVid). The result shows that only using dense depth information, we can achieve overall better accurate segmentation and recognition than that from sparse 3D features or appearance, or even the combination of sparse 3D features and appearance, advancing state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, by aligning 3D dense depth based features into a unified coordinate frame, our algorithm can handle the special case of view changes between training and testing scenarios. Preliminary evaluation in cross training and testing shows promising results."

We show that we can recognize the three dimensional structure of the interior of a building, even in the presence of occluding objects. Several physically valid structure hypotheses are proposed by geometric reasoning and verified to find the best fitting model to line segments, which is then converted to a full 3D model. Our experiments demonstrate that our structure recovery from line segments is comparable with methods using full image appearance. Our approach shows how a set of rules describing geometric constraints between groups of segments can be used to prune scene interpretation hypotheses and to generate the most plausible interpretation."

The presence of clutter is a major problem for existing single-view 3D reconstruction algorithms, most of which rely on finding the ground-wall boundary. In most rooms, this boundary is partially or entirely occluded. We gain robustness to clutter by modeling the global room space with a parameteric 3D \u201cbox\u201d and by iteratively localizing clutter and refitting the box. To fit the box, we introduce a structured learning algorithm that chooses the set of parameters to minimize error, based on global perspective cues. On a dataset of 308 images, we demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to recover spatial layout in cluttered rooms and show several examples of estimated free space."

Using perspective cues from the global scene geometry, we first develop a 3D based object detector. This detector is competitive with an image based detector built using state-of-the-art methods; however, combining the two produces a notably improved detector, because it unifies contextual and geometric information. We then use a probabilistic model that explicitly uses constraints imposed by spatial layout - the locations of walls and floor in the image - to refine the 3D object estimates. We use an existing approach to compute spatial layout [1], and use constraints such as objects are supported by floor and can not stick through the walls. The resulting detector (a) has significantly improved accuracy when compared to the state-of-the-art 2D detectors and (b) gives a 3D interpretation of the location of the object, derived from a 2D image. We evaluate the detector on beds, for which we give extensive quantitative results derived from images of real scenes."

This approach requires no training, and it can easily scale to datasets with tens of thousands of images and hundreds of labels. It works by scene-level matching with global image descriptors, followed by superpixel-level matching with local features and efficient Markov random field (MRF) optimization for incorporating neighborhood context. Our MRF setup can also compute a simultaneous labeling of image regions into semantic classes (e.g., tree, building, car) and geometric classes (sky, vertical, ground). Our system outperforms the state-of-the-art non-parametric method based on SIFT Flow on a dataset of 2,688 images and 33 labels. In addition, we report per-pixel rates on a larger dataset of 15,150 images and 170 labels. To our knowledge, this is the first complete evaluation of image parsing on a dataset of this size, and it establishes a new benchmark for the problem."

Inspired by the \"Blocks World\" work in the 1960's, we present a qualitative physical representation of an outdoor scene where objects have volume and mass, and relationships describe 3D structure and mechanical configurations. Our representation allows us to apply powerful global geometric constraints between 3D volumes as well as the laws of statics in a qualitative manner. We also present a novel iterative \"interpretation-by-synthesis\" approach where, starting from an empty ground plane, we progressively \"build up\" a physically-plausible 3D interpretation of the image. For surface layout estimation, our method demonstrates an improvement in performance over the state-of-the-art [9]. But more importantly, our approach automatically generates 3D parse graphs which describe qualitative geometric and mechanical properties of objects and relationships between objects within an image."

Today we are witnessing the birth of a new generation of sensing technologies capable of providing high quality synchronized videos of both color and depth, the RGB-D (Kinect-style) camera. With its advanced sensing capabilities and the potential for mass adoption, this technology represents an opportunity to dramatically increase robotic object recognition, manipulation, navigation, and interaction capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale, hierarchical multi-view object dataset collected using an RGB-D camera. The dataset contains 300 objects organized into 51 categories and has been made publicly available to the research community so as to enable rapid progress based on this promising technology. This paper describes the dataset collection procedure and introduces techniques for RGB-D based object recognition and detection, demonstrating that combining color and depth information substantially improves quality of results."

Our method builds upon the recent work in indoor scene understanding and the availability of motion capture data to create a joint space of human poses and scene geometry by modeling the physical interactions between the two. This joint space can then be used to predict potential human poses and joint locations from a single image. In a way, this work revisits the principle of Gibsonian affor-dances, reinterpreting it for the modern, data-driven era."

The method is based on a segmentation energy defined over all images at the same time, which can be optimized efficiently by techniques used before in interactive segmentation. Over iterations, our method progressively learns a class model by integrating observations over all images. In addition to appearance, this model captures the location and shape of the class with respect to an automatically determined coordinate frame common across images. This frame allows us to build stronger shape and location models, similar to those used in object class detection. Our method is inspired by interactive segmentation methods [1], but it is fully automatic and learns models characteristic for the object class rather than specific to one particular object/image. We experimentally demonstrate on the Caltech4, Caltech101, and Weizmann horses datasets that our method (a) transfers class knowledge across images and this improves results compared to segmenting every image independently; (b) outperforms Grabcut [1] for the task of unsupervised segmentation; (c) offers competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art in unsupervised segmentation and in particular it outperforms the topic model [2]."

We study the problem in the framework of hierarchical classification, where the geometric structure of an image can be represented by an ultrametric contour map, the soft boundary image associated to a family of nested segmentations. We define generic ultrametric distances by integrating local contour cues along the regions boundaries and combining this information with region attributes. Then, we evaluate quantitatively our results with respect to ground-truth segmentation data, proving that our system outperforms significantly two widely used hierarchical segmentation techniques, as well as the state of the art in local edge detection."

The main premise of the approach is the fact that in man-made environments, the majority of lines is aligned with the principal orthogonal directions of the world coordinate frame. We exploit this observation towards efficient detection and estimation of vanishing points, which provide strong constraints on camera parameters and relative orientation of the camera with respect to the scene.By combining efficient image processing techniques in the line detection and initialization stage we demonstrate that simultaneous grouping and estimation of vanishing directions can be achieved in the absence of internal parameters of the camera. Constraints between vanishing points are then used for partial calibration and relative rotation estimation. The algorithm has been tested in a variety of indoors and outdoors scenes and its efficiency and automation makes it amenable for implementation on robotic platforms."

The process typically involves segmenting images into regions and tracking these regions across image sequences. Neither of these tasks can be performed reliably in practice; consequently, colorization requires considerable user intervention and remains a tedious, time-consuming, and expensive task.In this paper we present a simple colorization method that requires neither precise image segmentation, nor accurate region tracking. Our method is based on a simple premise; neighboring pixels in space-time that have similar intensities should have similar colors. We formalize this premise using a quadratic cost function and obtain an optimization problem that can be solved efficiently using standard techniques. In our approach an artist only needs to annotate the image with a few color scribbles, and the indicated colors are automatically propagated in both space and time to produce a fully colorized image or sequence. We demonstrate that high quality colorizations of stills and movie clips may be obtained from a relatively modest amount of user input."

We construct a Bayesian model that implements this assumption and estimates the viewer orientation relative to the Manhattan grid. For many images, these estimates are good approximations to the viewer orientation (as estimated manually by the authors). These estimates also make it easy to detect outlier structures that are unaligned to the grid. To determine the applicability of the Manhattan world model, we implement a null hypothesis model that assumes that the image statistics are independent of any three-dimensional scene structure. We then use the log-likelihood ratio test to determine whether an image satisfies the Manhattan world assumption. Our results show that if an image is estimated to be Manhattan, then the Bayesian model's estimates of viewer direction are almost always accurate (according to our manual estimates), and vice versa."

Numerous applications in computer vision can be naturally interpreted as instanciations of this fundamental problem. Recently, a non-iterative discrete approach, tensor voting, has been introduced to solve this problem and has been applied successfully to various applications. As an alternative, we propose a variational formulation of this problem in the continuous setting and derive an iterative algorithm which approximates its solutions. This method and tensor voting are somewhat the differential and integral form of one another. Although iterative methods are slower in general, the strength of the suggested method is that it can easily be applied when the ambient space is not Euclidean, which is important in many applications. The algorithm consists in solving a partial differential equation that performs a special anisotropic diffusion on an implicit representation of the known set of points. This results in connecting isolated neighbouring points. This approach is very simple, mathematically sound, robust and powerful since it handles in a homogeneous way manifolds of arbitrary dimension and topology, embedded in Euclidean or non-Euclidean spaces, with or without border. We shall present this approach and demonstrate both its benefits and shortcomings in two different contexts: (i) data visual analysis, (ii) skin detection in color images."
