This is done in the framework of a standard statistical pattern recognition model. Both the vector quantizer and the hidden Markov models need to be trained for the vocabulary being recognized. Such training results in a distinct hidden Markov model for each word of the vocabulary. Classification consists of computing the probability of generating the test word with each word model and choosing the word model that gives the highest probability. There are several factors, in both the vector quantizer and the hidden Markov modeling, that affect the performance of the overall word recognition system, including the size of the vector quantizer, the structure of the hidden Markov model, the ways of handling insufficient training data, etc. The effects, on recognition accuracy, of many of these factors are discussed in this paper. The entire recognizer (training and testing) has been evaluated on a 10-word digits vocabulary. For training, a set of 100 talkers spoke each of the digits one time. For testing, an independent set of 100 tokens of each of the digits was obtained. The overall recognition accuracy was found to be 96.5 percent for the 100-talker test set. These results are comparable to those obtained in earlier work, using a dynamic time-warping recognition algorithm with multiple templates per digit. It is also shown that the computation and storage requirements of the new recognizer were an order of magnitude less than that required for a conventional pattern recognition system using linear prediction with dynamic time warping."

The method is based on rate-distortion speech coding (speech coding by vector quantization), minimum cross-entropy pattern classification, and information-theoretic spectral distortion measures. Separate vector quantization code books are designed from training sequences for each word in the recognition vocabulary. Inputs from outside the training sequence are classified by performing vector quantization and finding the code book that achieves the lowest average distortion per speech frame. The new method obviates time alignment. It achieves 99 percent accuracy for speaker-dependent recognition of a 20 -word vocabulary that includes the ten digits, with higher accuracy for recognition of the digit subset. For speaker-independent recognition, the method achieves 88 percent accuracy for the 20 -word vocabulary and 95 percent for the digit subset. Background of the method, detailed empirical results, and an analysis of computational requirements are presented."

Such models are called Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and are useful representations for speech signals in terms of some convenient observations (e.g., cepstral coefficients or pseudolog area ratios). One method of estimating parameters of HMMs is the well-known Baum-Welch reestimation method. For continuous pdf's, the method was known to work only for elliptically symmetric densities. We have recently shown that the method can be generalized to handle mixtures of elliptically symmetric pdf's. Any continuous pdf can be approximated to any desired accuracy by such mixtures, in particular, by mixtures of multivariate Gaussian pdf's. To effectively make use of this method of parameter estimation, it is necessary to understand how it is affected by the amount of training data available, the number of states in the Markov chain, the dimensionality of the signal, etc. To study these issues, Markov chains and random vector generators were simulated to generate training sequences from \u201ctoy\u201d models. The model parameters were estimated from these training sequences and compared to the \u201ctrue\u201d parameters by means of an appropriate distance measure. The results of several such experiments show the strong sensitivity of the method to some (but not all) of the model parameters. A procedure for getting good initial parameter estimates is, therefore, of considerable importance."

A frequency normalization with respect to the long-time spectral distribution is used to reduce effects of variations in the frequency response of telephone connections.

For speaker trained systems, the techniques that have been used include casual training, averaging, and use of statistical pattern recognition clustering methods. In a recent study, Rabiner and Wilpon showed that the statistical techniques, when combined with the technique of averaging the autocorrelation coefficients of all tokens within the cluster, provided a reliable, robust set of reference templates. The only drawback to this method was the extensive, burdensome training required for the statistical analysis. Since the statistical training method could not be used in most practical situations, techniques were investigated for obtaining a simplified, robust training procedure which would incorporate many of the ideas of the statistical approach. Such a training method is described in this paper. The advantages of this new training procedure, over (previously used..."

                "text": "In this paper, we propose a speaker-independent isolated ward recognition system whose performance is comparable to that of a conventional isolated word recognizer, but whose computation is greatly reduced. The structure of the proposed recognizer consists of a word-based vector quantization (VQ) preprocessor, followed by a conventional DTW postprocessor. The purpose of the preprocessor is essentially to eliminate from further consideration all words in the vocabulary which are unlikely recognition candidates. In some cases, the preprocessor will be able to eliminate all word candidates except one; for such cases, there is no further processing required for word recognition. In all other cases (i.e., when more than one word candidate is passed on), a dynamic time warping (DTW) processor is used to re-solve finer acoustical distinctions among the remaining word candidates. The performance of this type of recognizer (i.e., using a word-based preprocessor and a standard DTW comparison to make finer distinctions) is affected by a number of factors involved with the details of exactly how the system is implemented-e.g., the distortion measure used in the preprocessor and in the DTW comparison, the size of the VQ codebook for each vocabulary word, the decision thresholds of the preprocessor, etc. Several of these factors were studied experimentally using testing databases consisting of isolated digits and words from a vocabulary of 129 airline terms. The results show that the proposed preprocessor has the capability of reducing computation for recognition by up to an order of magnitude, while maintaining the same performance as that obtained using a DTW comparison without the pre-processor. A somewhat smaller reduction in memory over the straight DTW implementation is also obtained in the proposed approach."

                "text": "Recent studies of isolated word recognition systems have shown that a set of carefully chosen templates can be used to bring the performance of speaker\u2010independent systems up to that of systems trained to the individual speaker. The earliest work in this area used a sophisticated set of pattern recognition algorithms in a human\u2010interactive mode to create the set of templates (multiple patterns) for each word in the vocabulary. Not only was this procedure time consuming but it was impossible to reproduce exactly, because it was highly dependent on decisions made by the experimenter. Subsequent work led to an automatic clustering procedure which, given only a set of clustering parameters, clustered tokens with the same performance as the previously developed supervised algorithms. The one drawback of the automatic procedure was that the specification of the input parameter set was found to be somewhat dependent on the vocabulary type and size of population to be clustered. Since the user of such a statistical clustering algorithm could not be expected, in general, to know how to choose the word clustering parameters, even this automatic clustering algorithm was not appropriate for a completely general word recognition system. It is the purpose of this paper to present a new clustering algorithm based on a K\u2010means approach which requires no user parameter specification. Experimental data show that this new algorithm performs as well or better than the previously used clustering techniques when tested as part of a speaker independent isolated word recognition system."

These studies have used a 39\u2010word alpha\u2010digit vocabulary and a 54\u2010word vocabulary of computer terms. In this paper the clustering procedures, developed previously, are extended to create reference tokens for a 129\u2010word vocabulary of airline reservation terms. Instead of using a single, casually obtained token of each word by each of 100 talkers for the clustering procedure, each talker used the robust training procedure of Rabiner and Wilpon to provide a robust token of each vocabulary word. The effect on the clustering is to reduce the number of outlier tokens and to provide more robust clusters. Recognition tests using 20 new talkers yielded recognition accuracies of between 80%\u201397%. These accuracies are comparable to those obtained in an earlier study on the same vocabulary with speaker trained reference patterns."

Digital headers are particularly useful in enabling descriptive information to be written directly with the speech samples as well as enabling precise location of individual samples in a data base. The facility offers an attractive means for compactly storing large data bases of speech samples with relatively easy access to individual samples. An experiment is described in which speech sample utterances were digitized and processed on\u2010line simultaneously with recording directly onto cassette tapes with descriptive digital headers.

As a function of constraint length the performance of optimal convolutional codes is shown to be superior to that of block codes of the same length, the relative improvement increasing with rate.
