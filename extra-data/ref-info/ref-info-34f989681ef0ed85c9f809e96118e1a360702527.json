It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

All fields mapped with white light had a concentric arrangement sililar to that of the cat retinal ganglion cells, with a sharply demarcated 'on' centre surrounded by an antagonistic 'off' periphery, or the reverse. The smallest receptive field centres were found near the fovea, and the size of centres tended to increase with increasing distance from the fovea. The smallest centre had a diameter of 4 minutes of arc (corresponding to about 20 microns on the retina) and was located 4 degrees from the fovea; the largest centre had a diameter of 2 degrees. Three ganglion cells out of about 100 responded in a specific way to coloured stimuli. In these cells light of short wave-length produced an 'on' response and light of long wave-length evoked inhibition followed by an 'off' response. Transition between the two types of response occurred at about 500 millimicrons, light of this wave-length evoked only feebel 'off' responses. Very weak responses were obtained to white light, presumably owing to the antagonism between light of short and long wavelengths. (Author)"

In the visual system this problem has usually been approached by examining the effects of sensory deprivation on structure and behavior (see reviews by Hebb (12) and Riesen (28)). An obvious way of extending this work would be to examine electrophysiologically the functional effects of visual deprivation, but such experiments require some knowledge of normal function. During the last 10 years single-cell responses have been examined and receptive-field arrangements compared at several levels in the cat\u2019s visual pathway: in the retina (Zl), the lateral geniculate body (18), and the visual cortex (17, 19). This information provides the necessary background for a study of the immature and the stimulus-deprived visual system. The results of a physiological and anatomical study of the visual pathways in normal. and visually deprived kittens will be presented in a series of three papers. In the present paper we describe single-unit recordings in the optic tract and lateral geniculate body of kittens in which one eye had been deprived of vision, and an anatomical examination of the visual pathways in these animals. The second paper (20) will describe single-unit recordings in the striate cortex of newborn kittens. The final paper (32) will deal with responses of cells in the visual cortex of visually deprived animals."
