News captions generally provide vital search information about the video being presented, the names of people and places or descriptions of objects. In this paper, two difficult problems of character recognition for videos are addressed: low resolution characters and extremely complex backgrounds. We apply an interpolation filter, multi-frame integration and a combination of four filters to solve these problems. Segmenting characters is done by a recognition-based segmentation method and intermediate character recognition results are used to improve the segmentation. The overall recognition results are good enough for use in news indexing. Performing video OCR on news video and combining its results with other video understanding techniques will improve the overall understanding of the news video content."

News captions generally provide vital search information about the video being presented { the names of people and places or descriptions of objects. In this paper, two di cult problems of character recognition for videos are addressed: low resolution characters and extremely complex backgrounds. We apply an interpolation lter, multi-frame integration and a combination of four lters to solve these problems. Segmenting characters is done by a recognition-based segmentation method and intermediate character recognition results are used to improve the segmentation. The overall recognition results are good enough for use in news indexing. Performing Video OCR on news video and combining its results with other video understanding techniques will improve the overall understanding of the news video content."

The algorithms we propose make use of typical characteristics of text in videos in order to enable and enhance segmentation and recognition performance. Especially the inter-frame dependencies of the characters provide new possibilities for their refinement. Then, a straightforward indexing and retrieval scheme is introduced. It is used in the experiments to demonstrate that the proposed text segmentation and text recognition algorithms are suitable for indexing and retrieval of relevant video scenes in and from a video data base. Our experimental results are very encouraging and suggest that these algorithms can be used in video retrieval applications as well as to recognize higher semantics in video."

                "text": "There are many applications in which the automatic detection and recognition of text embedded in images is useful. These applications include digad libraries, multimedia systems, and Geographical Information Systems. When machine generated text is prdnted against clean backgrounds, it can be converted to a computer readable form (ASCII) using current Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. However, text is often printed against shaded or textured backgrounds or is embedded in images. Examples include maps, advertisements, photographs, videos and stock certificates. Current document segmentation and recognition technologies cannot handle these situafons well. In this paper, a four-step system which automaticnlly detects and extracts text in images i& proposed. First, a texture segmentation scheme is used to focus attention on regions where text may occur. Second, strokes are extracted from the segmented text regions. Using reasonable heuristics on text strings such as height similarity, spacing and alignment, the extracted strokes are then processed to form rectangular boxes surrounding the corresponding ttzt strings. To detect text over a wide range of font sizes, the above steps are first applied to a pyramid of images generated from the input image, and then the boxes formed at each resolution level of the pyramid are fused at the image in the original resolution level. Third, text is extracted by cleaning up the background and binarizing the detected ted strings. Finally, better text bounding boxes are generated by srsiny the binarized text as strokes. Text is then cleaned and binarized from these new boxes, and can then be passed through a commercial OCR engine for recognition if the text is of an OCR-recognizable font. The system is stable, robust, and works well on imayes (with or without structured layouts) from a wide van\u2019ety of sources, including digitized video frames, photographs, *This material is based on work supported in part by the National Science Foundation, Library of Congress and Department of Commerce under cooperative agreement number EEC9209623, in part by the United States Patent and mademark Office and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency/IT0 under ARPA order number D468, issued by ESC/AXS contract number F19628-96-C-0235, in part by the National Science Foundation under grant number IF&9619117 and in part by NSF Multimedia CDA-9502639.

It enables content-based browsing. We present our new methods for automatic segmentation of text in digital videos. The algorithms we propose make use of typical characteristics of text in videos in order to enable and enhance segmentation performance. The unique features of our approach are the tracking of characters and words over their complete duration of occurrence in a video and the integration of the multiple bitmaps of a character over time into a single bitmap. The output of the text segmentation step is then directly passed to a standard OCR software package in order to translate the segmented text into ASCII. Also, a straightforward indexing and retrieval scheme is introduced. It is used in the experiments to demonstrate that the proposed text segmentation algorithms together with existing text recognition algorithms are suitable for indexing and retrieval of relevant video sequences in and from a video database. Our experimental results are very encouraging and suggest that these algorithms can be used in video retrieval applications as well as to recognize higher level semantics in videos."

Existing quantization algorithms for color palettes cluster colors as 3-D vectors in a color space. Thus, they fail to remove the statistical redundancy in the image space. This weakness prevents a more efficient use of frame buffer capacity. We propose a simple product vector quantization (VQ) technique for frame buffers that exploits redundancies in both image and color spaces. The new VQ technique can reduce the frame buffer use of a color image by half from the current algorithms with comparable image quality. The NTSC YIQ rather than RGB color space is used in our product VQ scheme. Consequently, we propose to modify the current architecture of the color palette to suit the proposed product VQ algorithm in the YIQ mode. The modified color palette is nearly ten times smaller than the current RGB palette and is more flexible. The improved space efficiency in both frame buffer and color palette is achieved while neither complicating the control or logic of the frame buffer architecture nor increasing computational complexity of color quantization."

                "text": "Object and pattern detection is a classical computer vision problem with many potential applications, ranging from automatic target recognition to image-based industrial inspection tasks in assembly lines. While there have been some successful object and pattern detection systems in the past, most such systems handle only specific rigid objects or patterns that can be accurately described by fixed geometric models or pictorial templates. \nThis thesis presents a learning based approach for detecting classes of objects and patterns with variable image appearance but highly predictable image boundaries. Some examples of such object and pattern classes include human faces, aerial views of structured terrain features like volcanoes, localized material defect signatures in industrial parts, certain tissue anomalies in medical images, and instances of a given digit or character, which may be written or printed in many different styles. \nThe thesis consists of two parts. In part one, we introduce our object and pattern detection approach using a concrete human face detection example. The approach first builds a distribution-based model of the target pattern class in an appropriate feature space to describe the target's variable image appearance. It then learns from examples a similarity measure for matching new patterns against the distribution-based target model. We also discuss some pertinent learning issues, including ideas on virtual example generation and example selection. The approach makes few assumptions about the target pattern class and should therefore be fairly general, as long as the target class has predictable image boundaries. We show that this is indeed the case by demonstrating the technique on two other pattern detection/recognition problems. \nBecause our object and pattern detection approach is very much learning-based, how well a system eventually performs depends heavily on the quality of training examples it receives. The second part of this thesis looks at how one can select high quality examples for function approximation learning tasks. Active learning is an area of research that investigates how a learner can intelligently select future training examples to get better approximation results with less data. We propose an active learning formulation for function approximation, and show for three specific approximation function classes, that the active example selection strategy learns its target with fewer data samples than random sampling. Finally, we simplify the original active learning formulation, and show how it leads to a tractable example selection paradigm, suitable for use in many object and pattern detection problems.

We use a bootstrap algorithm for training the networks, which adds false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art face detection systems are presented; our system has better performance in terms of detection and false-positive rates."
