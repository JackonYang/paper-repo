Specifically, given that a given process y(\\cdot) obeys one of r distinct stochastic or deterministic difference equations each involving a vector of unknown parameters, we compute the posterior probability that a set of observations {y(1),...,y(N)} obeys the i th equation, after making suitable assumptions about the prior probability distribution of the parameters in each equation. The difference equations can be nonlinear in the variable y but should be linear in the parameter vector in it. Once the posterior probability is known, we can find a decision rule to choose between the various structures so as to minimize the average value of a loss function. The optimum decision rule is asymptotically consistent and gives a quantitative explanation for the \"principle of parsimony\" often used in the construction of models from empirical data. The decision rule answers a wide variety of questions such as the advisability of a nonlinear transformation of data, the limitations of a model which yields a perfect fit to the data (i.e., zero residual variance), etc. The method can be used not only to compare different types of structures but also to determine a reliable estimate of spectral density of process. We compare the method in detail with the hypothesis testing method, and other methods and give a number of illustrative examples."

The degradation is assumed to be due to a space invariant, periodic, nonseparable known point-spread function, and additive white noise. Our basic approach is to represent the images by a class of spatial interaction models, namely the simultaneous autoregressve models and the conditional Markov models defined on toroidal lattices, and develop minimum mean-squared error restoration algorithms using these models. The restoration algorithms are optimal, if the parameters characterizing the interaction models are exactly known. However, in practice, the parameters are estimated from the images. By using spatial interaction models, we develop restoration algorithms that do not require the availability of the original image or its prototype. The specific structure of the underlying lattice enables the implementation of the filters using fast Fourier transform (FFT) computations, Several restoration examples are given."

A texture model is a mathematical procedure capable of producing and describing a textured image. We explore the use of Markov random fields as texture models. The binomial model, where each point in the texture has a binomial distribution with parameter controlled by its neighbors and ``number of tries'' equal to the number of gray levels, was taken to be the basic model for the analysis. A method of generating samples from the binomial model is given, followed by a theoretical and practical analysis of the method's convergence. Examples show how the parameters of the Markov random field control the strength and direction of the clustering in the image. The power of the binomial model to produce blurry, sharp, line-like, and blob-like textures is demonstrated. Natural texture samples were digitized and their parameters were estimated under the Markov random field model. A hypothesis test was used for an objective assessment of goodness-of-fit under the Markov random field model. Overall, microtextures fit the model well. The estimated parameters of the natural textures were used as input to the generation procedure. The synthetic microtextures closely resembled their real counterparts, while the regular and inhomogeneous textures did not."

Most current statistical thinking does not use such a distribution but we feel that some illumination and understanding can be gained through its use, and, in our more enthusiastic moments, we even feel that only a completely Bayesian attitude towards statistical thinking is coherent and practical. The purpose of this paper is not to present propaganda in favor of the Bayesian attitude but merely to explore the consequences of it. The first two sections of the paper deal with the large-sample problem where the effect of the prior distribution is small and the inferences and decisions made using a Bayesian approach correspond fairly closely with current practice and are similar to those given by Le Cam [7] using the usual approach. If we emphasize any differences that do exist it is because they are of interest: the most important point is the similarity. In the final sections of the paper the problem of small samples is discussed. Here the prior distribution is important and much of the discussion centers around the choice of it. Some tentative rules are suggested for the choice and comparison is made with the work of Jeffreys. The discussion here is fragmentary and incomplete: but it is hoped that the arguments, unsatisfactory as they are, will stimulate others to produce better ones. Throughout this paper only the problem of the analysis of an experiment is discussed. Design problems are not considered."

These models include the traditional fast unitary transforms, autoregessive and state variable models as well as two-dimensional linear prediction models. These models introduced earlier [51], [52] as low-order finite difference approximations of partial differential equations are generalized and extended to higher order in the framework of linear prediction theory. Applications in several image Processing problems, including image restoration, smoothing, enhancement, data compression, spectral estimation, and filter design, are discussed and examples given."
