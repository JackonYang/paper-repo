This paper describes the work on these tasks done by France Telecom Team (Beijing) at the fourth International Chinese Language Processing Bakeoff. In particular, we employ Conditional Random Fields with different features for these tasks. In order to improve NER relatively low recall; we exploit non-local features and alleviate class imbalanced distribution on NER dataset to enhance the recall and keep its relatively high precision. Some other post-processing measures such as consistency checking and transformation-based error-driven learning are used to improve word segmentation performance. Our systems participated in most CWS and POS tagging evaluations and all the NER tracks. As a result, our NER system achieves the first ranks on MSRA open track and MSRA/CityU closed track. Our CWS system achieves the first rank on CityU open track, which means that our systems achieve state-of-the-art performance on Chinese lexical processing."

Recently neural network-based language models have been explored, as they as a byproduct generate highly informative vector representations for words, known as word embeddings. In this paper we present two contributions: a new form of learning word embeddings that can leverage information from relevant lexicons to improve the representations, and the first system to use neural word embeddings to achieve state-of-the-art results on named-entity recognition in both CoNLL and Ontonotes NER. Our system achieves an F1 score of 90.90 on the test set for CoNLL 2003---significantly better than any previous system trained on public data, and matching a system employing massive private industrial query-log data."

Signals that were reliable in copy-edited text disappear almost entirely in Twitter\u2019s informal chatter, requiring the construction of specialized models. Using wellunderstood techniques, we set out to improve Twitter NER performance when given a small set of annotated training tweets. To leverage unlabeled tweets, we build Brown clusters and word vectors, enabling generalizations across distributionally similar words. To leverage annotated newswire data, we employ an importance weighting scheme. Taken all together, we establish a new state-of-the-art on two common test sets. Though it is wellknown that word representations are useful for NER, supporting experiments have thus far focused on newswire data. We emphasize the effectiveness of representations on Twitter NER, and demonstrate that their inclusion can improve performance by up to 20 F1."

The performance of standard NLP tools is severely degraded on tweets. This paper addresses this issue by re-building the NLP pipeline beginning with part-of-speech tagging, through chunking, to named-entity recognition. Our novel T-ner system doubles F1 score compared with the Stanford NER system. T-ner leverages the redundancy inherent in tweets to achieve this performance, using LabeledLDA to exploit Freebase dictionaries as a source of distant supervision. LabeledLDA outperforms co-training, increasing F1 by 25% over ten common entity types. \n \nOur NLP tools are available at: http://github.com/aritter/twitter_nlp"

We study the problem of named entity normalization (NEN) for tweets. Two main challenges are the errors propagated from named entity recognition (NER) and the dearth of information in a single tweet. We propose a novel graphical model to simultaneously conduct NER and NEN on multiple tweets to address these challenges. Particularly, our model introduces a binary random variable for each pair of words with the same lemma across similar tweets, whose value indicates whether the two related words are mentions of the same entity. We evaluate our method on a manually annotated data set, and show that our method outperforms the baseline that handles these two tasks separately, boosting the F1 from 80.2% to 83.6% for NER, and the Accuracy from 79.4% to 82.6% for NEN, respectively."

We evaluate Brown clusters, Collobert and Weston (2008) embeddings, and HLBL (Mnih & Hinton, 2009) embeddings of words on both NER and chunking. We use near state-of-the-art supervised baselines, and find that each of the three word representations improves the accuracy of these baselines. We find further improvements by combining different word representations.

Previous methods only focus on in-domain supervised learning which is limited by the rare annotated data. However, there are enough corpora in formal domains and massive in-domain unannotated texts which can be used to improve the task. We propose a unified model which can learn from out-of-domain corpora and in-domain unannotated texts. The unified model contains two major functions. One is for cross-domain learning and another for semi-supervised learning. Cross-domain learning function can learn out-of-domain information based on domain similarity. Semi-Supervised learning function can learn in-domain unannotated information by self-training. Both learning functions outperform existing methods for NER in Chinese social media. Finally, our unified model yields nearly 11% absolute improvement over previously published results.\n \n"

                "text": "This article presents a pragmatic approach to Chinese word segmentation. It differs from most previous approaches mainly in three respects. First, while theoretical linguists have defined Chinese words using various linguistic criteria, Chinese words in this study are defined pragmatically as segmentation units whose definition depends on how they are used and processed in realistic computer applications. Second, we propose a pragmatic mathematical framework in which segmenting known words and detecting unknown words of different types (i.e., morphologically derived words, factoids, named entities, and other unlisted words) can be performed simultaneously in a unified way. These tasks are usually conducted separately in other systems. Finally, we do not assume the existence of a universal word segmentation standard that is application-independent. Instead, we argue for the necessity of multiple segmentation standards due to the pragmatic fact that different natural language processing applications might require different granularities of Chinese words. These pragmatic approaches have been implemented in an adaptive Chinese word segmenter, called MSRSeg, which will be described in detail. It consists of two components: (1) a generic segmenter that is based on the framework of linear mixture models and provides a unified approach to the five fundamental features of word-level Chinese language processing: lexicon word processing, morphological analysis, factoid detection, named entity recognition, and new word identification; and (2) a set of output adaptors for adapting the output of (1) to different application-specific standards. Evaluation on five test sets with different standards shows that the adaptive system achieves state-of-the-art performance on all the test sets."

In this paper, we introduce a novel neutral network architecture that benefits from both word- and character-level representations automatically, by using combination of bidirectional LSTM, CNN and CRF. Our system is truly end-to-end, requiring no feature engineering or data pre-processing, thus making it applicable to a wide range of sequence labeling tasks. We evaluate our system on two data sets for two sequence labeling tasks --- Penn Treebank WSJ corpus for part-of-speech (POS) tagging and CoNLL 2003 corpus for named entity recognition (NER). We obtain state-of-the-art performance on both the two data --- 97.55\\% accuracy for POS tagging and 91.21\\% F1 for NER."

We report observations about languages, named entity types, domains and textual genres studied in the literature. From the start, NERC systems have been developed using hand-made rules, but now machine learning techniques are widely used. These techniques are surveyed along with other critical aspects of NERC such as features and evaluation methods. Features are word-level, dictionary-level and corpus-level representations of words in a document. Evaluation techniques, ranging from intuitive exact match to very complex matching techniques with adjustable cost of errors, are an indisputable key to progress."

We propose to combine a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier with a linear Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model under a semi-supervised learning framework to tackle these challenges. The KNN based classifier conducts pre-labeling to collect global coarse evidence across tweets while the CRF model conducts sequential labeling to capture fine-grained information encoded in a tweet. The semi-supervised learning plus the gazetteers alleviate the lack of training data. Extensive experiments show the advantages of our method over the baselines as well as the effectiveness of KNN and semi-supervised learning."

                "text": "Social media has been increasing sharply with the development of Web2.0. Entity disambiguation has attracted great attentions recently. Understanding Chinese micro-blogs is a challenging due to the inherent feature of Chinese language, the informal usage of the language and the wide variety of contents it covers. With BaiDu Encyclopedia Webpages, the info and label items, the basics for disambiguation are obtained. BaiDu Encyclopedia and Wikipedia Encyclopedia are used to build the mapping table. Entity disambiguation includes two tasks in this paper: (1)linking entities is mainly based on the created mapping table; (2)removing ambiguities of entities from micro-blogs is crucial in entity reorganization. An improved label disambiguation algorithm is proposed. Binomial classification based on Chinese Family Names is introduced for improvement. SVM model is applied for classifying the to-be-tested entity. We evaluate our method on the open data sets provided by NLP&&CC 2014. We achieved 84.02% in terms of accuracy. The average accuracy rate of all teams is 70.58%. Ours is much higher than the average level. It shows that the proposed method is promising. Our work can provide invaluable insights into entity disambiguation in Chinese micro-blogs."

Named entity recognition and disambiguation is an important task in natural language processing and knowledge base construction. It aims at detecting entity mentions in raw text, followed by pointing the detected mentions to real world entities. Often, real world entities can be found on online encyclopedia like Wikipedia and Baike. This task focuses on NERD in Chinese Language, and presents some challenges unique to Chinese, namely the confusion of named entity with common words, and lack of capital clues as in English. We manually construct query names and a knowledge base from Baike. Evaluation results show promising future of this field."

A large number of rules is needed for coverage of the domain, suggesting that a fairly large number of labeled examples should be required to train a classifier. However, we show that the use of unlabeled data can reduce the requirements for supervision to just 7 simple \"seed\" rules. The approach gains leverage from natural redundancy in the data: for many named-entity instances both the spelling of the name and the context inwhich it appears are sufficient to determine its type. We present two algorithms. The first method uses a similar algorithm to that of (Yarowsky 95), with modifications motivated by (Blum and Mitchell 98). The second algorithm extends ideas from boosting algorithms, designed for supervised learning tasks, to the framework suggested by (Blum and Mitchell 98)."

We further extend our model to multi-task and cross-lingual joint training by sharing the architecture and parameters. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results in multiple languages on several benchmark tasks including POS tagging, chunking, and NER. We also demonstrate that multi-task and cross-lingual joint training can improve the performance in various cases."

In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. \n \nAn inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of \"Canada\" and \"Air\" cannot be easily combined to obtain \"Air Canada\". Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible."

Targeted Twitter stream is usually constructed by filtering tweets with user-defined selection criteria e.g. tweets published by users from a selected region, or tweets that match one or more predefined keywords. Targeted Twitter stream is then monitored to collect and understand users' opinions about the organizations. There is an emerging need for early crisis detection and response with such target stream. Such applications require a good named entity recognition (NER) system for Twitter, which is able to automatically discover emerging named entities that is potentially linked to the crisis. In this paper, we present a novel 2-step unsupervised NER system for targeted Twitter stream, called TwiNER. In the first step, it leverages on the global context obtained from Wikipedia and Web N-Gram corpus to partition tweets into valid segments (phrases) using a dynamic programming algorithm. Each such tweet segment is a candidate named entity. It is observed that the named entities in the targeted stream usually exhibit a gregarious property, due to the way the targeted stream is constructed. In the second step, TwiNER constructs a random walk model to exploit the gregarious property in the local context derived from the Twitter stream. The highly-ranked segments have a higher chance of being true named entities. We evaluated TwiNER on two sets of real-life tweets simulating two targeted streams. Evaluated using labeled ground truth, TwiNER achieves comparable performance as with conventional approaches in both streams. Various settings of TwiNER have also been examined to verify our global context + local context combo idea."

These models include LSTM networks, bidirectional LSTM (BI-LSTM) networks, LSTM with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) layer (LSTM-CRF) and bidirectional LSTM with a CRF layer (BI-LSTM-CRF). Our work is the first to apply a bidirectional LSTM CRF (denoted as BI-LSTM-CRF) model to NLP benchmark sequence tagging data sets. We show that the BI-LSTM-CRF model can efficiently use both past and future input features thanks to a bidirectional LSTM component. It can also use sentence level tag information thanks to a CRF layer. The BI-LSTM-CRF model can produce state of the art (or close to) accuracy on POS, chunking and NER data sets. In addition, it is robust and has less dependence on word embedding as compared to previous observations."

The comprehensiveness of Wikipedia has made the online encyclopedia an increasingly popular target for disambiguation. Disambiguation to Wikipedia is similar to a traditional Word Sense Disambiguation task, but distinct in that the Wikipedia link structure provides additional information about which disambiguations are compatible. In this work we analyze approaches that utilize this information to arrive at coherent sets of disambiguations for a given document (which we call \"global\" approaches), and compare them to more traditional (local) approaches. We show that previous approaches for global disambiguation can be improved, but even then the local disambiguation provides a baseline which is very hard to beat."

Methods that use both labeled and unlabeled data are generally referred to as semi-supervised learning. Although a number of such methods are proposed, at the current stage, we still don't have a complete understanding of their effectiveness. This paper investigates a closely related problem, which leads to a novel approach to semi-supervised learning. Specifically we consider learning predictive structures on hypothesis spaces (that is, what kind of classifiers have good predictive power) from multiple learning tasks. We present a general framework in which the structural learning problem can be formulated and analyzed theoretically, and relate it to learning with unlabeled data. Under this framework, algorithms for structural learning will be proposed, and computational issues will be investigated. Experiments will be given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in the semi-supervised learning setting."

In our experiments with these datasets, we observe two important points: (a) language drift on Twitter is significant, and while off-the-shelf systems have been reported to perform well on in-sample data, they often perform poorly on new samples of tweets, (b) state-of-the-art performance across various datasets can be obtained from crowdsourced annotations, making it more feasible to \u201ccatch up\u201d with language drift."
