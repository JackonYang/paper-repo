                "text": "What are the elements of early vision? This question might be taken to mean, What are the fundamental atoms of vision?\u2014and might be variously answered in terms ofsuch candidate structures as edges, peaks, corners, and so on. In this chapter we adopt a rather different point of view and ask the question, What are the fundamentalsubstances of vision? This distinction is important becausewe wish to focus on the first steps in extraction of visualinformation. At this level it is premature to talk aboutdiscrete objects, even such simple ones as edges and corners.There is general agreement that early vision involvesmeasurements of a number of basic image properties in-cluding orientation, color, motion, and so on. Figure l.lshows a caricature (in the style of Neisser, 1976), of the sort of architecture that has become quite popular as a model for both human and machine vision. The first stageof processing involves a set of parallel pathways, eachdevoted to one particular-visual property. We propose that the measurements of these basic properties be con-sidered as the elements of early vision. We think of earlyvision as measuring the amounts of various kinds of vi-sual \"substances\" present in the image (e.g., redness orrightward motion energy). In other words, we are inter- ested in how early vision measures \u201cstuff\u201d rather than in how it labels \u201cthings.\u201dWhat, then, are these elementary visual substances?Various lists have been compiled using a mixture of intui-tion and experiment. Electrophysiologists have describedneurons in striate cortex that are selectively sensitive tocertain visual properties; for reviews, see Hubel (1988) and DeValois and DeValois (1988). Psychophysicists haveinferred the existence of channels that are tuned for cer- tain visual properties; for reviews, see Graham (1989), Olzak and Thomas (1986), Pokorny and Smith (1986), and Watson (1986). Researchers in perception have foundaspects of visual stimuli that are processed pre-attentive- ly (Beck, 1966; Bergen & Julesz, 1983; Julesz & Bergen,"

This synthesis is completely automatic and requires only the \u201ctarget\u201d texture as input. It allows generation of as much texture as desired so that any object can be covered. It can be used to produce solid textures for creating textured 3-d objects without the distortions inherent in texture mapping. It can also be used to synthesize texture mixtures, images that look a bit like each of several digitized samples. The approach is based on a model of human texture perception, and has potential to be a practically useful tool for graphics applications."

We fit the BRDF measurements to two recent models to obtain a BRDF parameter database. These BRDF parameters can be directly used for both image analysis and image synthesis. Finally, we present a BTF (bidirectional texture function) database with image textures from over 60 different samples, each observed with over 200 different combinations of viewing and source directions.

We have found that humans can effectively estimate certain surface reflectance properties from a single image without knowledge of illumination. We develop a machine vision system to perform similar reflectance estimation tasks automatically. The problem of estimating reflectance form single images under unknown, complex illumination proves highly under-constrained due to the variety of potential reflectances and illuminations. Our solution relies on statistical regularities in the spatial structure of real-world illumination. These regularities translate into predictable relationships between surface reflectance and certain statistical features of the image. We determine these relationships using machine learning techniques. Our algorithms do not depend on color or polarization; they apply even to monochromatic imagery. An ability to estimate reflectance under uncontrolled illumination will further efforts to recognize materials and surface properties, tp capture computer graphics models from photographs, and to generalize classical motion and stereo algorithms such that they can handle non-Lambertian surfaces."

Luminance can be directly observed, but reflectance and illumination can only be derived by perceptual processes. Human observers are good at judging an object's reflectance in spite of large changes in illumination; this skill is known as \"lightness constancy.\" Most research on lightness constancy has used stimuli consisting of grey patches on a single flat plane. The models are typically based on the assumption that slow variations in luminance are due to illumination gradients, while sharp changes in luminance are due to reflectance edges. The retinex models for use with \"Mondrian\" stimuli are good examples (Land and McCann, 1971; Horn, 1974). But in three-dimensional scenes, sharp luminance changes can arise from either reflectance or from illumination, as illustrated in Figure 11.1(a). The edge marked (1) is due to a reflectance change, such as might result from a different shade of paint. The edge marked (2) results from a change in surface normal which leads to a change in the angle of incidence of the light -an effect that we may simply refer to as \"shading.\" As Gilchrist and his colleagues have emphasized (Gilchrist et al., 1983), three-dimensional scenes introduce large and important effects that are completely missed in the traditional approach to lightness perception."

The stimulus we used was a square surface modulated in depth by a low-pass-filtered random field and rendered by the Phong illumination model [Commun. ACM 18, 311 (1975)]. Two different surface images (target and match) were presented side by side, with either the viewing direction or the surface-normal direction rotating around the horizontal axis. The target shape was manipulated by changing the spatial spectrum, and the target reflectance was manipulated by changing the diffuse-reflection coefficient and the specular-reflection exponent (shininess) of the Phong model. The shape parameters of the match stimulus were fixed, but its reflectance parameters were under the control of subjects, who had to make the apparent reflectance of the two surfaces as similar as possible. The results showed that the constant error (difference between simulated and matched values) was large except when the two surfaces had the same shape parameters or when they differed only in scale. The pattern of the constant errors and response variabilities suggests that the judgments of the subjects were based on the similarity of the luminance histogram of the surface image. Our results demonstrate a limitation of surface-reflectance constancy for changes in shape and the importance of image-based information in reflectance judgments. The results are discussed in relation to previous studies that showed effects of spatial layout on surface-reflectance perception."

                "text": "The amount of light coming to the eye from an object depends on the amount of light striking the surface, and on the proportion of light that is reflected. If a visual system only made a single measurement of luminance, acting as a pho-tometer, then there would be no way to distinguish a white surface in dim light from a black surface in bright light. Yet humans can usually do so, and this skill is known as lightness constancy. The constancies are central to perception. An organism needs to know about meaningful world-properties, such as color, size, shape, etc. These properties are not explicitly available in the retinal image, and must be extracted by visual processing. The gray shade of a surface is one such property. To extract it, luminance information must be combined across space. Figure 24.1 shows the well-known simultaneous contrast effect, which demonstrates a spatial interaction in lightness perception. The two smaller squares are the same shade of gray. However, the square in the dark surround appears lighter than the square in the light surround. Illusions like these are sometimes viewed as quirky failures of perception, but they help reveal the inner workings of a system that functions remarkably well. Here we will consider how lightness illusions can inform us about lightness perception. The visual system processes information at many levels of sophistication. At the retina, there is low-level vision, including light adaptation and the center-surround receptive fields of ganglion cells. At the other extreme is high-level vision, which includes cognitive processes that incorporate knowledge about objects, materials, and scenes. In between there is mid-level vision. Mid-level vision is simply an ill-defined region between low and high. The representations and the processing in the middle stages are commonly thought to involve surfaces, contours, grouping, and so on. Lightness perception seems to involve all three levels of processing. The low-level approach to lightness is associated with Ewald Hering. He considered adaptation and local interactions , at a physiological level, as the crucial mechanisms. This approach has long enjoyed popularity because it offers an attractive connection between physiology and psy-chophysics. Figure 24.2(a) shows the receptive field of an idealized center-surround cell. The cell exhibits lateral inhibition: light in the center is excitatory while light in the surround is inhibitory. A cross-section of the receptive field is shown in figure 24.2(b). This cell performs a local comparison between a given \u2026"

We investigated in detail the structure of highlight patterns that are due to material surface roughness. We interpret results in terms of a simple model of a random Gaussian surface. The model's prediction corresponds with the microscopic measurement within a factor of 2. The method allows one to rank generally the roughness of the surfaces of the fruit samples by purely optical means. This simple procedure for estimating surface roughness from images has implications for visual perception and graphic rendering."
