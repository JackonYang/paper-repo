The paper is organized according to 2-D, 2\u00bd-D, and 3-D object representations, which are used as the basis for the recognition algorithms. Three central issues common to each category, namely, feature extraction, modeling, and matching, are examined in detail. An evaluation and comparison of existing industrial part-recognition systems and algorithms is given, providing insights for progress toward future robot vision systems."

The general 3-D object recognition task can be thought of as building a description of the object that must have at least two parts: 1) the internal description of the object itself (with respect to an object-centered frame); and 2) the transformation of the object-centered frame to the viewer-centered (image) frame. The reason for this decomposition is parsimony: different views of the object should have minimal impact on its description. This is achieved by factoring the object's description into two sets of parameters, one which is view-independent (the object-centered component) and one which is view-varying (the viewing transformation). Often a description of the object is known beforehand and the task reduces to finding the objectframe to viewer-frame transformation. This paper describes a method for handling this case: a known object is detected by finding changes in orientation, translation, and scale of the object from its canonical description. The method is a Hough technique and has the characteristic insensitivity to occlusion and noise."

The inversion problem for polyhedra (from an EGI to a description in terms of vertices and faces) has been solved, by an iterative algorithm [Little, 1983]. The algorithm depends upon the mixed volume, a geometric construction linking the areas and positions of the faces of an object. A robust method for determining object attitude from the EGI is developed here, using this construction. Experiments show the method's insensitivity to small attitude differences. 1 I n t r o d u c t i o n Orientation maps can be generated by binocular stereo [Baker and Binford, 1981] [Grimson, 1981], photometric stereo [Woodham, 1980], shape from shading [Horn, 1975], or by differentiation of laser range images[Brou, 1984]. By translating the surface normals of an object to a common point, a representation of the distribution of surface orientation is formed, called the Extended Gaussian Image (EGI) [Horn, 1984]. Figure 1 shows the Extended Gaussian Image of a polyhedron and the corresponding object. Horn and Ikeuchi[1984] demonstrated the feasibility of using EGIs for attitude determination, comparing the EGI of a prototype with a sensed EGI. The reconstruction method using the mixed volume suggests a new method for attitude determination. This method is practical and more robust than direct comparison of EGIs. A detailed discussion of this method is presented in [Little, 1985]. * This research was supported in part by a UBC University Graduate Fellowship and by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada grant A3390."

The objects are modeled as polyhedra having up to six degrees of freedom relative to the sensors. We show that inconsistent hypotheses about pairings between sensed points and object surfaces can be discarded efficiently by using local constraints on distances between faces, angles between face normals, and angles (relative to the surface normals) of vectors between sensed points. We show by simu lation and by mathematical bounds that the number of hy potheses consistent with these constraints is small. We also show how to recover the position and orientation of the object from the sensory data. The algorithm's performance on data obtained from a triangulation range sensor is illustrated."

Compliant motions are quite difficult for humans to specify, however. Furthermore, robot programs are quite sensitive to details of geometry and to error characteristics and must, therefore, be constructed anew for each task. These factors motivate the search for automatic synthesis tools for robot program ming, especially for compliant motion. This paper describes a formal approach to the synthesis of compliant-motion strategies from geometric descriptions of assembly operations and explicit estimates of errors in sensing and control. A key aspect of the approach is that it provides criteriafor correct ness of compliant-motion strategies."
