A view-based multiple-observer eigenspace technique is proposed for use in face recognition under variable pose. In addition, a modular eigenspace description technique is used which incorporates salient features such as the eyes, nose and mouth, in an eigenfeature layer. This modular representation yields higher recognition rates as well as a more robust framework for face recognition.

While shape and reflectance are intrinsic properties of an object and are constant, pose and illumination vary from scene to scene. They present a new compact representation of object appearance that is parameterized by pose and illumination.

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture."

A recognition accuracy of 99.35% is obtained using frontal views of 155 individuals. This figure is consistent with the 95% recognition rate obtained previously on a much larger database of 7,562 `mugshots' of approximately 3,000 individuals, consisting of a mix of all age and ethnic groups. We also demonstrate that we can automatically determine head pose without significantly lowering recognition accuracy; this is accomplished by use of a view-based multiple-observer eigenspace technique. In addition, a modular eigenspace description is used which incorporates salient facial features such as the eyes, nose and mouth, in an eigenfeature layer. This modular representation yields slightly higher recognition rates as well as a more robust framework for face recognition. In addition, a robust and automatic feature detection technique using eigentemplates is demonstrated."

After modeling these image differences as a stochastic process, the optimal filter is derived. This filter is shown to be the principal component of the data.

Our previous studies of physical transformations of the face, including translation, small rotations, and illumination changes, showed that the set of face images consists of relatively simple connected subregions in image space. Consequently linear matching techniques can be used to obtain reliable face recognition. However, for more general transformations, such as large rotations or scale changes, the face subregions become highly non-convex. We have therefore developed a scale-space matching technique that allows us to take advantage of knowledge about important geometrical transformations and about the topology of the face subregion in image space. While recognition of faces is the focus of this paper, the algorithm is sufficiently general to be applicable to a large variety of object recognition tasks"

During the last two decades, the method of maximum likelihood has become the most widely followed approach to this problem, thanks primarily to the advent of high speed electronic computers. Here, we first offer a brief survey of the literature directed toward this problem and review maximum-likelihood estimation for it. We then turn to the subject of ultimate interest, which is a particular iterative procedure for numerically approximating maximum-likelihood estimates for mixture density problems. This procedure, known as the EM algorithm, is a specialization to the mixture density context of a general algorithm of the same name used to approximate maximum-likelihood estimates for incomplete data problems.

These tools differ from those used in standard image databases in that they make direct use of the image content rather than relying on annotations. Direct search on image content is made possible by use of semantics-preserving image compression, which reduces images to a small set of perceptually significant coefficients. We describe three Photobook tools in particular: one that allows search based on gray-level appearance, one that uses 2-D shape, and a third that allows search based on textural properties."

For example, the sample space might be the outcomes of the roll of a die, or flips of a coin. To each element x of the sample space, we assign a probability, which will be a non-negative number between 0 and 1, which we will denote by p(x). We require that x\u2208S p(x) = 1, so the total probability of the elements of our sample space is 1. What this means intuitively is that when we perform our process, exactly one of the things in our sample space will happen. Example. The sample space could be S = {a, b, c}, and the probabilities could be p(a) = 1/2, p(b) = 1/3, p(c) = 1/6. If all elements of our sample space have equal probabilities, we call this the uniform probability distribution on our sample space. For example, if our sample space was the outcomes of a die roll, the sample space could be denoted S = {x 1 , x 2 ,. .. , x 6 }, where the event x i correspond to rolling i. The uniform distribution, in which every outcome x i has probability 1/6 describes the situation for a fair die. Similarly, if we consider tossing a fair coin, the outcomes would be H (heads) and T (tails), each with probability 1/2. In this situation we have the uniform probability distribution on the sample space S = {H, T }. We define an event A to be a subset of the sample space. For example, in the roll of a die, if the event A was rolling an even number, then A = {x 2 , x 4 , x 6 }. The probability of an event A, denoted by P(A), is the sum of the probabilities of the corresponding elements in the sample space. For rolling an even number, we have P(A) = p(x 2) + p(x 4) + p(x 6) = 1 2 Given an event A of our sample space, there is a complementary event which consists of all points in our sample space that are not \u2026"
