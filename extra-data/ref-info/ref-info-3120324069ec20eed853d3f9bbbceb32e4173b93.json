                "text": "Energy minimization is an elegant approach to computer vision. Vision problems usually have many solutions due to uncertainties in the imaging process and ambiguities in visual interpretation. The energy function encodes the problem constraints, and its minimum gives the optimal solution. Despite numerous advantages, this approach is severely limited by the high computational cost. \nThe main contribution of my thesis lies in developing efficient combinatorial optimization algorithms for several important classes of energy functions which incorporate everywhere smooth, piecewise constant, and piecewise smooth priors. These priors assume, respectively, that the quantity to be estimated varies smoothly over its domain, consist of several pieces with constant values, or consist of several pieces with smoothly varying values. The algorithms rely on graph cuts as a powerful optimization technique. \nFor a certain everywhere smooth prior we develop an algorithm which finds the exact minimum by computing a single graph cut. This method is most suitable to estimate quantities without discontinuities. But even when discontinuities exist, the method produces good results in certain cases. The running time is low order polynomial. \nFor several wide classes of piecewise smooth priors we develop two approximation algorithms (we show that exact minimization in NP-hard in these cases). These algorithms produce a local minimum in interesting large move spaces. Furthermore, one of them finds a solution within a known factor from the optimum. The algorithms are iterative and compute several graph cuts at each iteration. The running time at each iteration is effectively linear due to the special graph structure. In practice it takes just a few iterations to converge. Moreover most of the progress happens during the first iteration. \nFor a certain piecewise constant prior we adapt the algorithms developed for the piecewise smooth prior. One of them finds a solution within a factor of two from the optimum. In addition we develop a third algorithm which finds a local minimum in yet another move space. \nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on image restoration, stereo, and motion. For the data with ground truth, our methods significantly outperform standard methods."

                "text": "One of the challenges of computer vision is that the information we seek to extract from images is not even defined for most images. Because of this, we cannot hope to find a simple process that produces the information directly from a given image. Instead, we need a search, or an optimization, in the space of parameters that we are trying to estimate. \nIn this thesis, I introduce two new optimization methods that use graph algorithms. They are characterized by their ability to find a global optimum efficiently. Each method defines a graph that can be seen as embedded in a Euclidean space. Graph-theoretic entities such as cuts and cycles represent geometric objects that embody the information we seek. \nThe first method finds a hypersurface in a Euclidean space that minimizes a certain kind of energy functional. The hypersurface is approximated by a cut of an embedded graph so that the total cost of the cut corresponds to the energy. A globally optimal solution is found by using a minimum cut algorithm. In particular, it can globally solve first order Markov Random Field problems in more general cases than previously known. I prove that the convexity of the smoothing function in the energy is essential for the applicability of the method and provide an exact criterion in terms of the MRF energy. \nAn optimal cycle in a Euclidean space can be found efficiently by the second method proposed here. It uses a minimum ratio cycle algorithm to find a cycle with minimum energy in an embedded graph. In the case of two dimensions, the energy can depend not only on the cycle itself but also on the region defined by the cycle. Because of this, the method unifies the two competing views of boundary and region segmentation. \nI demonstrate the utility of the methods in applications with the results of experiments in the areas of binocular stereo, image restoration, and image segmentation. The image segmentation, or contour extraction, experiments are carried out in various situations using different information such as motion, stereo, and intensity."

By segmentation, we mean a map from the set of pixels to a small set of levels such that each connected component of the set of pixels with the same level forms a relatively large and \"meaningful\" region. The method finds a set of levels with associated gray values by first finding junctions in the image and then seeking a minimum set of threshold values that preserves the junctions. Then it finds a segmentation map that maps each pixel to the level with the closest gray value to the pixel data, within a smoothness constraint. For a convex smoothing penalty, we show the global optimal solution for an energy function that fits the data can be obtained in a polynomial time, by a novel use of the maximum-flow algorithm.

In addition this property allows an efficient implementation of the algorithms because for most pixels p the computation of C/sub p/ is not performed on the whole graph. We inspect all C/sub p/ and discard those which are not interesting, for example if they are too small.

The clustering problem is viewed as a graph partitioning problem, where nodes represent data elements and the weights of the edges represent pairwise similarities. We generate samples of cuts in this graph, by using Karger's contraction algorithm (1996), and compute an \"average\" cut which provides the basis for our solution to the clustering problem. The stochastic nature of our method makes it robust against noise, including accidental edges and small spurious clusters. The complexity of our algorithm is very low: O(|E| log/sup 2/ N) for N objects, |E| similarity relations, and a fixed accuracy level. In addition, and without additional computational cost, our algorithm provides a hierarchy of nested partitions. We demonstrate the superiority of our method for image segmentation on a few synthetic and real images, both B&W and color. Our other examples include the concatenation of edges in a cluttered scene (perceptual grouping) and the organization of an image database for the purpose of multiview 3D object recognition."

Frequently, processes are needed which reduce ambiguity and noise, and select the best label among several possible choices. Relaxation labeling processes are just such a class of algorithms. They are based on the parallel use of local constraints between labels. This paper develops a theory to characterize the goal of relaxation labeling. The theory is founded on a definition of con-sistency in labelings, extending the notion of constraint satisfaction. In certain restricted circumstances, an explicit functional exists that can be maximized to guide the search for consistent labelings. This functional is used to derive a new relaxation labeling operator. When the restrictions are not satisfied, the theory relies on variational cal-culus. It is shown that the problem of finding consistent labelings is equivalent to solving a variational inequality. A procedure nearly identical to the relaxation operator derived under restricted circum-stances serves in the more general setting. Further, a local convergence result is established for this operator. The standard relaxation labeling formulas are shown to approximate our new operator, which leads us to conjecture that successful applications of the standard methods are explainable by the theory developed here. Observations about con-vergence and generalizations to higher order compatibility relations are described."

The data to be clustered are represented by an undirected adjacency graph G with arc capacities assigned to reflect the similarity between the linked vertices. Clustering is achieved by removing arcs of G to form mutually exclusive subgraphs such that the largest inter-subgraph maximum flow is minimized. For graphs of moderate size ( approximately 2000 vertices), the optimal solution is obtained through partitioning a flow and cut equivalent tree of G, which can be efficiently constructed using the Gomory-Hu algorithm (1961). However for larger graphs this approach is impractical. New theorems for subgraph condensation are derived and are then used to develop a fast algorithm which hierarchically constructs and partitions a partially equivalent tree of much reduced size. This algorithm results in an optimal solution equivalent to that obtained by partitioning the complete equivalent tree and is able to handle very large graphs with several hundred thousand vertices. The new clustering algorithm is applied to the image segmentation problem. The segmentation is achieved by effectively searching for closed contours of edge elements (equivalent to minimum cuts in G), which consist mostly of strong edges, while rejecting contours containing isolated strong edges. This method is able to accurately locate region boundaries and at the same time guarantees the formation of closed edge contours. >"

The model is a joint probability distribution for the array of pixel gray levels and an array of labels. In boundary finding, the labels are binary, zero, or one, representing the absence or presence of boundary elements. In partitioning, the label values are generic: two labels are the same when the corresponding scene locations are considered to belong to the same region. The distribution incorporates a measure of disparity between certain spatial features of block pairs of pixel gray levels, using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov nonparametric measures of difference between the distributions of these features. The number of model parameters is minimized by forbidding label configurations, which are assigned probability zero. The maximum a posteriori estimator of boundary placements and partitionings is examined. The forbidden states introduce constraints into the calculation of these configurations. Stochastic relaxation methods are extended to accommodate constrained optimization. >"

Once solved, the minimum-cut associated to the maximum-flow yields a disparity surface for the whole image at once. This global approach to stereo analysis provides a more accurate and coherent depth map than the traditional line-by-line stereo. Moreover, the optimality of the depth surface is guaranteed and can be shown to be a generalization of the dynamic programming approach that is widely used in standard stereo. Results show improved depth estimation as well as better handling of depth discontinuities. While the worst case running time is O(n/sup 2/d/sup 2/log(nd)), the observed average running time is O(n/sup 1.2/ d/sup 1.3/) for an image size of n pixels and depth resolution d."

The image restoration problem is considered in a Bayesian setting. We assume as prior distribution multicolour Markov random fields on a graph whose main restriction is the presence of only pairwise site interactions. The noise is modelled as a Bernoulli field. Computing the mode of the posterior distribution is NP complete, i.e. can (very likely) be done only in a time exponential in the number of sites of the underlying graph. Our algorithm runs in polynomial time and is based on the coding of the colours. It produces an image with the following property: either a pixel is coloured with one of the possible colours or it is left blank. In the first case we prove that this is the colour of the site in the exact MAP restoration. The quality of the approximation is then measured by the number of sites being left blank. We assess the performance of the new algorithm by numerical experiments on the simple three-colour Potts model. More rigorously, we present a probabilistic analysis of the algorithm. The results indicate that the approximation is quite often sufficiently good for the interpretation of the image."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

While these methods give very strong results in practice, they do not handle occlusions properly. Specifically, they treat the two input images asymmetrically, and they do not ensure that a pixel corresponds to at most one pixel in the other image. In this paper, we present a new method which properly addresses occlusions, while preserving the advantages of graph cut algorithms.

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

                "text": "Depth and motion discontinuities arise wherever a light ray incident on a camera sensor meets a discrete change in the depth or motion of the surfaces in the world. Because these discontinuities tend to coincide with occlusions and with the boundaries of objects, they provide useful information for a number of applications in computer vision, such as camera control, compression, and tracking. Moreover, because they have simple, precise definitions depending only upon the physics of the scene, they are unaffected by subjective considerations. \nThe first part of this thesis presents an algorithm to detect depth discontinuities from a stereo pair of images by matching pixels in corresponding scanlines and then propagating information between those scanlines. It uses a new measure of pixel dissimilarity that is provably insensitive to image sampling. The algorithm is fast and is shown to produce good results on difficult images containing untextured, slanted surfaces. \nThen some work aimed at detecting motion discontinuities from a monocular image sequence is described, along with a discussion of why this is a harder problem. A preliminary algorithm is given which tracks sparse features throughout a sequence, groups them according to an affine motion model, and traces the boundaries between the groups. Results show that the technique is promising but needs future work. \nThen two recent maximum-flow-based stereo algorithms are compared, showing their ability to work well on textured, fronto-parallel surfaces as well as their inability to handle untextured, slanted surfaces. We extend one of the techniques to solve stereo or motion correspondence with textured, slanted surfaces. \nFinally, an algorithm that uses the knowledge of discontinuities to track a person's head is described. Modeling the head as an ellipse and concentrating on the intensity edges around the perimeter as well as the color of the interior, the system is able to automatically control a camera in real time to follow a person moving around an unmodified environment. Extensive experimentation shows the algorithm's robustness with respect to full 360-degree out-of-plane rotation, severe but brief occlusion, arbitrary camera movement, and a dynamic background."

In this paper we focus on MRFs with two-valued clique potentials, which form a generalized Potts model. We show that the maximum a posteriori estimate of such an MRF can be obtained by solving a multiway minimum cut problem on a graph. We develop efficient algorithms for computing good approximations to the minimum multiway, cut. The visual correspondence problem can be formulated as an MRF in our framework; this yields quite promising results on real data with ground truth. We also apply our techniques to MRFs with linear clique potentials."

A promising approach is to view the motion segmentation problem in a mixture estimation framework. However, existing formulations generally use only the motion, data and thus fail to make use of static cues when segmenting the sequence. Furthermore, the number of models is either specified in advance or estimated outside the mixture model framework. In this work we address both of these issues. We show how to add spatial constraints to the mixture formulations and present a variant of the EM algorithm that males use of both the form and the motion constraints. Moreover this algorithm estimates the number of segments given knowledge about the level of model failure expected in the sequence. The algorithm's performance is illustrated on synthetic and real image sequences."

In this paper we propose an experimental comparison of several different stereo algorithms. We use real imagery, and explore two different methodologies, with different strengths and weaknesses. Our first methodology is based upon manual computation of dense ground truth. Here we make use of a two stereo pairs: one of these, from the University of Tsukuba, contains mostly fronto-parallel surfaces; while the other, which we built, is a simple scene with a slanted surface. Our second methodology uses the notion of prediction error, which is the ability of a disparity map to predict an (unseen) third image, taken from a known camera position with respect to the input pair. We present results for both correlation-style stereo algorithms and techniques based on global methods such as energy minimization. Our experiments suggest that the two methodologies give qualitatively consistent results. Source images and additional materials, such as the implementations of various algorithms, are available on the web from http://www.research.microsoft.com/~szeliski/stereo."

Through regularization, they may be reformulated as well-posed variational principles whose solutions are computable. Standard regularization theory employs quadratic stabilizing functionals that impose global smoothness constraints on possible solutions. Discontinuities present serious difficulties to standard regularization, however, since their reconstruction requires a precise spatial control over the smoothing properties of stabilizers. This paper proposes a general class of controlled-continuity stabilizers which provide the necessary control over smoothness. These nonquadratic stabilizing functionals comprise multiple generalized spline kernels combined with (noncontinuous) continuity control functions. In the context of computational vision, they may be thought of as controlled-continuity constraints. These generic constraints are applicable to visual reconstruction problems that involve both continuous regions and discontinuities, for which global smoothness constraints fail."

Smith in the Chair] SUMMARY A continuous two-dimensional region is partitioned into a fine rectangular array of sites or \"pixels\", each pixel having a particular \"colour\" belonging to a prescribed finite set. The true colouring of the region is unknown but, associated with each pixel, there is a possibly multivariate record which conveys imperfect information about its colour according to a known statistical model. The aim is to reconstruct the true scene, with the additional knowledge that pixels close together tend to have the same or similar colours. In this paper, it is assumed that the local characteristics of the true scene can be represented by a nondegenerate Markov random field. Such information can be combined with the records by Bayes' theorem and the true scene can be estimated according to standard criteria. However, the computational burden is enormous and the reconstruction may reflect undesirable largescale properties of the random field. Thus, a simple, iterative method of reconstruction is proposed, which does not depend on these large-scale characteristics. The method is illustrated by computer simulations in which the original scene is not directly related to the assumed random field. Some complications, including parameter estimation, are discussed. Potential applications are mentioned briefly."

An iterative implementation is shown which successfully computes the optical flow for a number of synthetic image sequences.

The algorithm consists of a sampling framework which unifies the processes of model selection, parameter estimation and image segmentation, in a single Markov chain. To achieve this, reversible jumps are incorporated into the Markov chain to allow movement between model spaces. By using partial decoupling to segment the MRF it is possible to generate jump proposals efficiently while providing a mechanism for the use of deterministic methods, such as Gabor filtering, to speed up convergence."

As a specific example of the approach's efficacy, applying dynamic programming to the energy-minimizing active contours is described. The optimization problem is set up as a discrete multistage decision process and is solved by a time-delayed discrete dynamic programming algorithm.

Not surprisingly, biological vision systems still greatly outperform computer vision programs. One of the keys to the reliability, flexibility, and robustness of biological vision systems is their ability to integrate several visual cues. A computational technique for integrating different visual cues has now been developed and implemented with encouraging results on a parallel supercomputer."
