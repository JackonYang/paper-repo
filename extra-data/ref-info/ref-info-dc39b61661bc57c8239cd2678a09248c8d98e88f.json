To cope with these problems we represent the 3D human body as a graphical model in which the relationships between the body parts are represented by conditional probability distributions. We formulate the pose estimation problem as one of probabilistic inference over a graphical model where the random variables correspond to the individual limb parameters (position and orientation). Because the limbs are described by 6-dimensional vectors encoding pose in 3-space, discretization is impractical and the random variables in our model must be continuous-valued. To approximate belief propagation in such a graph we exploit a recently introduced generalization of the particle filter. This framework facilitates the automatic initialization of the body-model from low level cues and is robust to occlusion of body parts and scene clutter."

Within a Bayesian framework, we define a generative model of image appearance, a robust likelihood function based on image graylevel differences, and a prior probability distribution over pose and joint angles that models how humans move. The posterior probability distribution over model parameters is represented using a discrete set of samples and is propagated over time using particle filtering. The approach extends previous work on parameterized optical flow estimation to exploit a complex 3D articulated motion model. It also extends previous work on human motion tracking by including a perspective camera model, by modeling limb self occlusion, and by recovering 3D motion from a monocular sequence. The explicit posterior probability distribution represents ambiguities due to image matching, model singularities, and perspective projection. The method relies only on a frame-to-frame assumption of brightness constancy and hence is able to track people under changing viewpoints, in grayscale image sequences, and with complex unknown backgrounds."

Moving people are modeled with the assumption that, while configuration can vary quite substantially from frame to frame, appearance does not. This leads to an algorithm that firstly builds a model of the appearance of the body of each individual by clustering candidate body segments, and then uses this model to find all individuals in each frame. Unusually, the tracker does not rely on a model of human dynamics to identify possible instances of people; such models are unreliable, because human motion is fast and large accelerations are common. We show our tracking algorithm can be interpreted as a loopy inference procedure on an underlying Bayes net. Experiments on video of real scenes demonstrate that this tracker can (a) count distinct individuals; (b) identify and track them; (c) recover when it loses track, for example, if individuals are occluded or briefly leave the view; (d) identify the configuration of the body largely correctly; and (e) is not dependent on particular models of human motion."

We introduce the use of a novel mathematical technique, the product of exponential maps and twist motions, and its integration into a differential motion estimation. This results in solving simple linear systems, and enables us to recover robustly the kinematic degrees-of-freedom in noise and complex self occluded configurations. We demonstrate this on several image sequences of people doing articulated full body movements, and visualize the results in re-animating an artificial 3D human model. We are also able to recover and re-animate the famous movements of Eadweard Muybridge's motion studies from the last century. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computer vision based system that is able to process such challenging footage and recover complex motions with such high accuracy."

Analyzing articulated motion is challenging because the dimensionality increase potentially demands tremendous increase of computation. To ease this problem, we propose an approach that analyzes subparts locally while reinforcing the structural constraints at the mean time. The computational model of the proposed approach is based on a dynamic Markov network, a generative model which characterizes the dynamics and the image observations of each individual subpart as well as the motion constraints among different subparts. Probabilistic variational analysis of the model reveals a mean field approximation to the posterior densities of each subparts given visual evidence, and provides a computationally efficient way for such a difficult Bayesian inference problem. In addition, we design mean field Monte Carlo (MFMC) algorithms, in which a set of low dimensional particle filters interact with each other and solve the high dimensional problem collaboratively. Extensive experiments on tracking human body parts demonstrate the effectiveness, significance and computational efficiency of the proposed method."

Monocular 3D body tracking is challenging: for reliable tracking at least 30 joint parameters need to be estimated, subject to highly nonlinear physical constraints; the problem is chronically ill conditioned as about 1/3 of the d.o.f. (the depth-related ones) are almost unobservable in any given monocular image; and matching an imperfect, highly flexible self-occluding model to cluttered image features is intrinsically hard. To reduce correspondence ambiguities we use a carefully designed robust matching-cost metric that combines robust optical flow, edge energy, and motion boundaries. Even so, the ambiguity, nonlinearity and non-observability make the parameter-space cost surface multi-modal, unpredictable and ill conditioned, so minimizing it is difficult. We discuss the limitations of CONDENSATION-like samplers, and introduce a novel hybrid search algorithm that combines inflated-covariance-scaled sampling and continuous optimization subject to physical constraints. Experiments on some challenging monocular sequences show that robust cost modelling, joint and self-intersection constraints, and informed sampling are all essential for reliable monocular 3D body tracking."

Search algorithms, either deterministic or stochastic, that search such a space without constraint, fall foul of exponential computational complexity. One approach is to introduce constraints: either labelling using markers or colour coding, prior assumptions about motion trajectories or view restrictions. Another is to relax constraints arising from articulation, and track limbs as if their motions were independent. In contrast, we aim for general tracking without special preparation of objects or restrictive assumptions. The principal contribution of the paper is the development of a modified particle filter for search in high dimensional configuration spaces. It uses a continuation principle based on annealing to introduce the influence of narrow peaks in the fitness function, gradually. The new algorithm, termed annealed particle filtering, is shown to be capable of recovering full articulated body motion efficiently."

We define a \"card-board person model\" in which a person's limbs are represented by a set of connected planar patches. The parametrized image motion of these patches in constrained to enforce articulated motion and is solved for directly using a robust estimation technique. The recovered motion parameters provide a rich and concise description of the activity that can be used for recognition. We propose a method for performing view-based recognition of human activities from the optical flow parameters that extends previous methods to cope with the cyclical nature of human motion. We illustrate the method with examples of tracking human legs of long image sequences."

We seek a model of appearance and motion that is generic in that it accounts for the ways in which people's appearance varies and, at the same time, is specific enough to be useful for tracking people in natural scenes. Given a 3D model of the person projected into an image we model the likelihood of observing various image cues conditioned on the predicted locations and orientations of the limbs. These cues are taken to be steered filter responses corresponding to edges, ridges, and motion-compensated temporal differences. Motivated by work on the statistics of natural scenes, the statistics of these filter responses for human limbs are learned from training images containing hand-labeled limb regions. Similarly, the statistics of the filter responses in general scenes are learned to define a \u201cbackground\u201d distribution. The likelihood of observing a scene given a predicted pose of a person is computed, for each limb, using the likelihood ratio between the learned foreground (person) and background distributions. Adopting a Bayesian formulation allows cues to be combined in a principled way. Furthermore, the use of learned distributions obviates the need for hand-tuned image noise models and thresholds. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the statistics of how people appear in scenes and provides a connection between work on natural image statistics and the Bayesian tracking of people."

The template is formulated as a Bayesian graphical model of a two-dimensional shape contour, and it is matched to the image using a variant of the belief propagation (BP) algorithm used for inference on graphical models. The algorithm can localize a target shape contour in a cluttered image and can accommodate arbitrary global translation and rotation of the target as well as significant shape deformations, without requiring the template to be initialized in any special way (e.g. near the target).The use of BP removes a serious restriction imposed in related earlier work, in which the matching is performed by dynamic programming and thus requires the graphical model to be tree-shaped (i.e. without loops). Although BP is not guaranteed to converge when applied to inference on non-tree-shaped graphs, we find empirically that it does converge even for deformable template models with one or more loops. To speed up the BP algorithm, we augment it by a pruning procedure and a novel technique, inspired by the 20 Questions (divide-and-conquer) search strategy, called \"focused message updating.\" These modifications boost the speed of convergence by over an order of magnitude, resulting in an algorithm that detects and localizes shapes in grayscale images in as little as several seconds on an 850 MHz AMD processor."

We show how to find people by finding candidate body segments, and then constructing assemblies of segments that are consistent with the constraints on the appearance of a person that result from kinematic properties. Since a reasonable model of a person requires at least nine segments, it is not possible to inspect every group, due to the huge combinatorial complexity.We propose two approaches to this problem. In one, the search can be pruned by using projected versions of a classifier that accepts groups corresponding to people. We describe an efficient projection algorithm for one popular classifier, and demonstrate that our approach can be used to determine whether images of real scenes contain people.The second approach employs a probabilistic framework, so that we can draw samples of assemblies, with probabilities proportional to their likelihood, which allows to draw human-like assemblies more often than the non-person ones. The main performance problem is in segmentation of images, but the overall results of both approaches on real images of people are encouraging."

The numerous approaches to this problem differ in the type of background model used and the procedure used to update the model. This paper discusses modeling each pixel as a mixture of Gaussians and using an on-line approximation to update the model. The Gaussian, distributions of the adaptive mixture model are then evaluated to determine which are most likely to result from a background process. Each pixel is classified based on whether the Gaussian distribution which represents it most effectively is considered part of the background model. This results in a stable, real-time outdoor tracker which reliably deals with lighting changes, repetitive motions from clutter, and long-term scene changes. This system has been run almost continuously for 16 months, 24 hours a day, through rain and snow."

We introduce a simplified model of a deformable object class and derive the optimal detector for this model. However, the optimal detector is not realizable except under special circumstances (independent part positions). A cousin of the optimal detector is developed which uses \u201csoft\u201d part detectors with a probabilistic description of the spatial arrangement of the parts. Spatial arrangements are modeled probabilistically using shape statistics to achieve invariance to translation, rotation, and scaling. Improved recognition performance over methods based on \u201chard\u201d part detectors is demonstrated for the problem of face detection in cluttered scenes."

This assumption states that the imaged scene contains three orthogonal, dominant directions, and is often satisfied by outdoor or indoor views of man-made structures and environments.The proposed method combines the calibration likelihood introduced in [5] with a stochastic search algorithm to obtain a MAP estimate of the camera's focal length and alignment. Results on real images of indoor scenes are presented. The calibrations obtained are less accurate than those from standard methods employing a calibration pattern or multiple images. However, the outputs are certainly good enough for common vision tasks such as tracking. Moreover, the results are obtained without any user intervention, from a single image, and without use of a calibration pattern."

As the state-space of a model grows, the dependencies between the dimensions lead to an exponential growth in computation when performing inference. Many common computer vision problems naturally map onto the graphical model framework; the representation is a graph where each node contains a portion of the state-space and there is an edge between two nodes only if they are not independent conditional on the other nodes in the graph. When this graph is sparsely connected, belief propagation algorithms can turn an exponential inference computation into one, which is linear in the size of the graph. However belief propagation is only applicable when the variables in the nodes are discrete-valued or jointly represented by a single multivariate Gaussian distribution, and this rules out many computer vision applications. This paper combines belief propagation with ideas from particle filtering; the resulting algorithm performs inference on graphs containing both cycles and continuous-valued latent variables with general conditional probability distributions. Such graphical models have wide applicability in the computer vision domain and we test the algorithm on example problems of low-level edge linking and locating jointed structures in clutter."

There exist inference algorithms for discrete approximations to these continuous distributions, but for the high-dimensional variables typically of interest, discrete inference becomes infeasible. Stochastic methods such as particle filters provide an appealing alternative. However, existing techniques fail to exploit the rich structure of the graphical models describing many vision problems. Drawing on ideas from regularized particle filters and belief propagation (BP), this paper develops a nonparametric belief propagation (NBP) algorithm applicable to general graphs. Each NBP iteration uses an efficient sampling procedure to update kernel-based approximations to the true, continuous likelihoods. The algorithm can accommodate an extremely broad class of potential functions, including nonparametric representations. Thus, NBP extends particle filtering methods to the more general vision problems that graphical models can describe. We apply the NBP algorithm to infer component interrelationships in a parts-based face model, allowing location and reconstruction of occluded features."

Each part is represented using a simple appearance model and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. While pictorial structures were introduced a number of years ago, they have not been broadly applied to matching and recognition problems. This has been due in part to the computational difficulty of matching pictorial structures to images. In this paper we present an efficient algorithm for finding the best global match of a pictorial stucture to an image. With this improved algorithm, pictorial structures provide a practical and powerful framework for quantitative descriptions of objects and scenes, and are suitable for many generic image recognition problems. We illustrate the approach using simple models of a person and a car."

Two types of density estimates are derived for modeling the training data: a multivariate Gaussian (for unimodal distributions) and a mixture-of-Gaussians model (for multimodal distributions). Those probability densities are then used to formulate a maximum-likelihood estimation framework for visual search and target detection for automatic object recognition and coding. Our learning technique is applied to the probabilistic visual modeling, detection, recognition, and coding of human faces and nonrigid objects, such as hands."

FRAME combines attractive aspects of two important themes in texture modeling: multi-channel filtering and Markov random field (MRF) modeling. It incorporates the responses of a set of well selected filters into the distribution over a random field and hence has a much stronger descriptive ability than the traditional MRF models. Furthermore, it interprets and clarifies many previous concepts and methods for texture analysis and synthesis from a unified point of view. Algorithms are proposed for probability inference, stochastic simulation and filter selection. Experiments on a variety of textures are described to illustrate our theory and to show the performance of our algorithms. These experiments demonstrate that many textures previously considered as different categories can be modeled and synthesized in a common framework."

This paper develops two multiscale algorithms for sampling from a product of Gaussian mixtures, and compares their performance to existing methods. The first is a multiscale variant of previously proposed Monte Carlo techniques, with comparable theoretical guarantees but improved empirical convergence rates. The second makes use of approximate kernel density evaluation methods to construct a fast approximate sampler, which is guaranteed to sample points to within a tunable parameter \u0454 of their true probability. We compare both multi-scale samplers on a set of computational examples motivated by NBP, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods."
