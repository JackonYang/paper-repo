Cluster membership is encoded in features that are incorporated in a discriminatively trained tagging model. Active learning is used to select training examples. We evaluate the technique for named-entity tagging. Compared with a state-of-the-art HMM-based name finder, the presented technique requires only 13% as much annotated data to achieve the same level of performance. Given a large annotated training set of 1,000,000 words, the technique achieves a 25% reduction in error over the state-of-the-art HMM trained on the same material."

Labeled and unlabeled data are represented as vertices in a weighted graph, with edge weights encoding the similarity between instances. The learning problem is then formulated in terms of a Gaussian random field on this graph, where the mean of the field is characterized in terms of harmonic functions, and is efficiently obtained using matrix methods or belief propagation. The resulting learning algorithms have intimate connections with random walks, electric networks, and spectral graph theory. We discuss methods to incorporate class priors and the predictions of classifiers obtained by supervised learning. We also propose a method of parameter learning by entropy minimization, and show the algorithm's ability to perform feature selection. Promising experimental results are presented for synthetic data, digit classification, and text classification tasks."

Conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden Markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models. Conditional random fields also avoid a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative Markov models based on directed graphical models, which can be biased towards states with few successor states. We present iterative parameter estimation algorithms for conditional random fields and compare the performance of the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on synthetic and natural-language data."

This is important because in many text classification problems obtaining training labels is expensive, while large quantities of unlabeled documents are readily available.We introduce an algorithm for learning from labeled and unlabeled documents based on the combination of Expectation-Maximization (EM) and a naive Bayes classifier. The algorithm first trains a classifier using the available labeled documents, and probabilistically labels the unlabeled documents. It then trains a new classifier using the labels for all the documents, and iterates to convergence. This basic EM procedure works well when the data conform to the generative assumptions of the model. However these assumptions are often violated in practice, and poor performance can result. We present two extensions to the algorithm that improve classification accuracy under these conditions: (1) a weighting factor to modulate the contribution of the unlabeled data, and (2) the use of multiple mixture components per class. Experimental results, obtained using text from three different real-world tasks, show that the use of unlabeled data reduces classification error by up to 30%."

Examples include the information that face images provide about the names of the people portrayed, or the information that speech sounds provide about the words spoken. Understanding the signal $x$ requires more than just predicting $y$, it also requires specifying which features of $\\X$ play a role in the prediction. We formalize this problem as that of finding a short code for $\\X$ that preserves the maximum information about $\\Y$. That is, we squeeze the information that $\\X$ provides about $\\Y$ through a `bottleneck' formed by a limited set of codewords $\\tX$. This constrained optimization problem can be seen as a generalization of rate distortion theory in which the distortion measure $d(x,\\x)$ emerges from the joint statistics of $\\X$ and $\\Y$. This approach yields an exact set of self consistent equations for the coding rules $X \\to \\tX$ and $\\tX \\to \\Y$. Solutions to these equations can be found by a convergent re-estimation method that generalizes the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm. Our variational principle provides a surprisingly rich framework for discussing a variety of problems in signal processing and learning, as will be described in detail elsewhere."

These representations allow us to efficiently implement limited memory methods for large constrained optimization problems. In particular, we discuss how to compute projections of limited memory matrices onto subspaces. We also present a compact representation of the matrices generated by Broyden's update for solving systems of nonlinear equations."
