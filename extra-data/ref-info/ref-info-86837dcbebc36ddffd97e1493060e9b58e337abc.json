Experimental cluster analysis is performed on a sample corpus of 2267 documents. A term-term similarity matrix is constructed for the 3950 unique terms used to index the documents. Various threshold values, T, are applied to the similarity matrix to provide a series of binary threshold matrices. The corresponding graph of each binary threshold matrix is used to obtain the term clusters.\nThree definitions of a cluster are analyzed: (1) the connected components of the threshold matrix; (2) the maximal complete subgraphs of the connected components of the threshold matrix; (3) clusters of the maximal complete subgraphs of the threshold matrix, as described by Gotlieb and Kumar.\nAlgorithms are described and analyzed for obtaining each cluster type. The algorithms are designed to be useful for large document and index collections. Two algorithms have been tested that find maximal complete subgraphs. An algorithm developed by Bierstone offers a significant time improvement over one suggested by Bonner.\nFor threshold levels T \u2265 0.6, basically the same clusters are developed regardless of the cluster definition used. In such situations one need only find the connected components of the graph to develop the clusters."

We compare the numerical accuracy possible with different choices of F having approximately the same range and requiring the same word length. In particular, we compare different choices of base (or radix) in the usual floating-point systems. The emphasis is on the choice of F, not on the details of the number representation or the arithmetic, but both rounded and truncated arithmetic are considered. Theoretical results are given, and some simulations of typical floating-point computations (forming sums, solving systems of linear equations, finding eigenvalues) are described. If the leading fraction bit of a normalized base-2 number is not stored explicitly (saving a bit), and the criterion is to minimize the mean square roundoff error, then base 2 is best. If unnormalized numbers are allowed, so the first bit must be stored explicitly, then base 4 (or sometimes base 8) is the best of the usual systems."

This translation can be difficult in large and complex machines. The amount of test data required to isolate faults, and the obscure symptoms some faults generate, preclude efficient manual test-by-test interpretations. The additional observed fact that a significant number of faults yield inconsistent test results from diagnosis to diagnosis demands a flexible interpretation of data. Techniques are described for producing fault dictionaries which can be used by the maintenance craftsman to identify machine faults in a relatively short time. These techniques utilize multidimensional geometric representations of diagnostic results, methods for identifying and ignoring inconsistent tests, pseudo-random mappings, and other procedures for condensing and organizing the information contained in diagnostic test data. The results of applying these techniques to data obtained from the Bell System's No. 1 Electronic Switching System are also discussed."
