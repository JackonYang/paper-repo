We present a unified methodology that is applicable to construction of document structures at different hierarchical levels. An iterative, relaxation-like method is used to find a partitioning solution that maximizes the probability of the extracted structure. All the probabilities used in the partitioning process are estimated from an extensive training set of various kinds of measurements among the entities within the hierarchy. The offline probabilities estimated in the training then drive all decisions in the online document structure extraction. We have implemented a text line extraction algorithm using this framework."

This paper describes a general solution for detecting tables based on computing an optimal partitioning of a document into some number of tables. A dynamic programming algorithm is given to solve the resulting optimization problem. This high-level framework is independent of any particular table quality measure and independent of the document medium. Moreover, it does not rely on the presence of ruling lines or other table delimiters. We also present table quality measures based on white space correlation and vertical connected component analysis. These measures can be applied equally well to ASCII text and scanned images. We report on some preliminary experiments using this method to detect tables in both ASCII text and scanned images, yielding promising results. We present detailed evaluation of these results using three different criteria which by themselves pose interesting research questions."

The resulting T-Recs system takes word bounding box information as input, and outputs the corresponding logical text block units. Starting with an arbitrary word as block seed the algorithm recursively expands this block to all words that interleave with their vertical neighbors. Since even smallest gaps of table columns prevent their words from mutual interleaving, this initial segmentation is able to identify and isolate such columns. In order to deal with some inherent segmentation errors caused by isolated lines, overhanging words, or cells spawning more than one column, a series of postprocessing steps is added. These steps benefit form a very simple distinction between type 1 and type 2 blocks: type 1 blocks are those of at most one word per line, all others are of type 2. This distinction allows the selective application of heuristics to each group of blocks. The conjoint decomposition of column blocks into subsets of table cells leads to the final block segmentation of a homogeneous abstraction level. These segments serve the final layout analysis which identifies table environments and cells that are stretching over several rows and/or columns."

Searching for a set of known table headers (approach 1) works rather well in a significant number of documents. But this approach (though it is implemented tolerant to OCR errors) is not tolerant enough towards some kinds of even minor aberrations. This not only decreases the recognition results, but also, even worse, makes users feel uncomfortable. Pragmatically trying to mimic for what the human eyes might key, leads to our two further, complementary approaches: searching for layout structures which resemble parts of columns (approach 2), and searching for groupings of similar lines (approach 3). The suitability of the approaches for our system requires them to be very simple to implement and simple to explain to users, computationally cheap, and combinable. In the domain of health insurances who receive huge amounts of so called medical liquidations on a daily basis we obtain very good results. On document samples representative for the every day practice of five customers-health insurance companies-tables were spotted as good and as fast as the customers expected the system to be. We thus consider our current approaches as a step towards cognitive adequacy."

T-Recs works on the output of commercial OCR systems that provide the word bounding box geometry together with the text itself (e.g. Xerox ScanWorX). While T-Recs performs well on a number of document categories, business letters still remained a challenging domain because the T-Recs location heuristics are mislead by their header or footer resulting in a low recognition precision. Business letters such as invoices are a very interesting domain for industrial applications due to the large amount of documents to be analyzed and the importance of the data carried within their tables. Hence, we developed a more restrictive approach which is implemented in the T-Recs++ prototype. This paper describes the ideas of the T-Recs++ location and also proposes a quality evaluation measure that reflects the bottom-up strategy of either T-Recs or T-Recs++. Finally, some results comparing both systems on a collection of business letters are given."

The proposed approach introduces a concept of table grid which can serve for advanced methods of table structure analysis. It provides a layer of terminal symbols for the table, which is used by syntactical methods. Detailed discussion of grid detection is presented which is performed through the analysis of connected components projection profile. Simple rules for analysis of table structure cover majority of real life tables. The system is implemented, rested, and is now extensively used in FineReader OCR product."

The algorithm is probability based. An iterative, relaxation-like method is used to find the partitioning solution that maximizes the joint probability. To evaluate the performance of our test word extraction algorithm, we used a 3-fold validation method and developed a quantitative performance measure. The algorithm was evaluated on the UW-III database of some 1600 scanned document image pages. An area-overlap measure was used to find the correspondence between the detected entities and the ground-truth. For a total of 827, 433 ground truth words, the algorithm identified and segmented 800, 149 words correctly, an accuracy of 97.43%."

The text block extraction algorithm described in this paper is probability based. We adopt an engineering approach to systematically characterising the text block structures based on a large document image database, and develop statistical methods to extract the text block structures from the image. All the probabilities are estimated from an extensive training set of various kinds of measurements among the text lines, and among the text blocks in the training data set. The off-line probabilities estimated in the training then drive all decisions in the on-line text block extraction. An iterative, relaxation-like method is used to find the partitioning solution that maximizes the joint probability. To evaluate the performance of our text block extraction algorithm, we used a three-fold validation method and developed a quantitative performance measure. The algorithm was evaluated on the UW-III database of some 1600 scanned document image pages. The text block extraction algorithm identifies and segments 91% of text blocks correctly."

In these tables, textual data are presented in record lines made up of fixed-width fields. Tables often do not rely on line-art (ruled lines) to delimit fields, and in this way differ crucially from fixed forms. Our system performs these steps: copes with multiple tables per page; identifies records within tables; segments records into fields; and recognizes characters within fields, constrained by field-specific contextual knowledge. Obstacles to good performance on tables include small print, tight line-spacing, poor-quality text (such as photocopies), and line-art or background patterns that touch the text. Precise skew-correction and pitch-estimation, and high-performance OCR using neural nets proved crucial in overcoming these obstacles. The most significant technical advances in this work appear to be algorithms for identifying and segmenting records with known layout, and integration of these algorithms with a graphical user interface (GUI) for defining new layouts. This GUI has been ergonomically designed to make efficient and intuitive use of exemplary images, so that the skill and manual effort required to retarget the system to new table layouts are held to a minimum. The system has been applied in this way to more than 400 distinct tabular layouts. During the last three years the system has read over fifty million records with high accuracy."
