A user of a natural-language-processing system would naturally expect it to reflect the same preferences. Thus, such systems must model in some way the linguistic performance as well as the linguistic competence of the native speaker. We have developed a parsing algorithm--a variant of the LALR(I) shift-reduce algorithm--that models the preference behavior of native speakers for a range of syntactic preference phenomena reported in the psycholinguistic literature, including the recent data on lexical preferences. The algorithm yields the preferred parse deterministically, without building multiple parse trees and choosing among them. As a side effect, it displays appropriate behavior in processing the much discussed garden-path sentences. The parsing algorithm has been implemented and has confirmed the feasibility of our approach to the modeling of these phenomena."

The system answers questions, executes commands, and accepts information in an interactive English dialog. It is based on the belief that in modeling language understanding, we must deal in an integrated way with all of the aspects of language\u2014syntax, semantics, and inference. The system contains a parser, a recognition grammar of English, programs for semantic analysis, and a general problem solving system. We assume that a computer cannot deal reasonably with language unless it can understand the subject it is discussing. Therefore, the program is given a detailed model of a particular domain. In addition, the system has a simple model of its own mentality. It can remember and discuss its plans and actions as well as carrying them out. It enters into a dialog with a person, responding to English sentences with actions and English replies, asking for clarification when its heuristic programs cannot understand a sentence through the use of syntactic, semantic, contextual, and physical knowledge. Knowledge in the system is represented in the form of procedures, rather than tables of rules or lists of patterns. By developing special procedural representations for syntax, semantics, and inference, we gain flexibility and power. Since each piece of knowledge can be a procedure, it can call directly on any other piece of knowledge in the system."

There are a number of problems with building a syntactic parser to explicitly encode these strategies as the starting point for a language understanding system. We list three major ones here. First, humans can understand sequences of words with ill-formed syntactic structure. Second, when beginning with a syntactic parser, there is no good way to smoothly integrate semantic and lexical strategies, so the different strategies are usually subjugated to the status of subroutines called by some control program of dubious psychological and linguistic credentials (Winograd, 1972). Third, since garden path sentences.have been taken as validation of the structural principles, it would be good if they always caused humans to garden path. Not so, Crain and Steedman (1981) have shown how easy it is to prevent backtracking by adding context to garden path sentences."

The language processing portion of the system uses a number of augmented transition networks, each of which matches phrases with a specific meaning, along with context registers (history keepers) and concept case frames; these are used for judging meaningfulness of questions, generating dialogue for clarifying partially understood questions, and resolving ellipsis and pronoun reference problems. Other system components construct a formal query for the relational database, and optimize the order of searching relations. Methods are discussed for handling vague or complex questions and for providing browsing ability.

                "text": "This paper presents a spreading-acti vation theory of human semantic processing, which can be applied to a wide range of recent experimental results. The theory is based on Quillian's theory of semantic memory search and semantic preparation, or priming. In conjunction with this, several of the miscondeptions concerning Qullian's theory are discussed. A number of additional assumptions are proposed for his theory in order to apply it to recent experiments. The present paper shows how the extended theory can account for results of several production experiments by Loftus, Juola and Atkinson's multiple-category experiment, Conrad's sentence-verification experiments, and several categorization experiments on the effect of semantic relatedness and typicality by Holyoak and Glass, Rips, Shoben, and Smith, and Rosch. The paper also provides a critique of the Smith, Shoben, and Rips model for categorization judgments. Some years ago, Quillian1 (1962, 1967) proposed a spreading-acti vation theory of human semantic processing that he tried to implement in computer simulations of memory search (Quillian, 1966) and comprehension (Quillian, 1969). The theory viewed memory search as activation spreading from two or more concept nodes in a semantic network until an intersection was found. The effects of preparation (or priming) in semantic memory were also explained in terms of spreading activation from the node of the primed concept. Rather than a theory to explain data, it was a theory designed to show how to build human semantic structure and processing into a computer."

The simulation, READER, is a natural language understanding system that reads a text word by word and whose processing cycles on each word have some correspondence with the human gaze duration on that word. READER operates within a newly developed information processing architecture, a Collaborative, Activation-based, Production System (CAPS) that permits the modeling of the temporal properties of human comprehension. CAPS allows for concurrent, collaborative execution of processes operating at different levels of analysis. As READER encounters each successive word, the word is operated on by processes at the levels of word encoding, lexical access, syntactic and semantic analysis, and referential and schema-level processes. Like human readers, READER uses a strategy of immediacy of comprehension, attempting to interpret each word as soon as it is encountered, rather than unnecessarily buffering information. A major contribution of this simulation is its use of human performance characteristics in constraining and determining the model's mechanisms."

The central focus of this work is a study on how one could build robust natural language processing systems that can detect and recover from miscommunication. The study of miscommunication is a necessary task within such a context since any computer capable of communicating with humans in natural language must be tolerant of the complex, imprecise, or ill-devised utterances that people often use. This goal first required an inquiry into how people communicate and how they recover from problems in communication. This led to the development of techniques for avoiding failures of reference that were employed in the reference identification component of a natural language understanding program. The traditional approaches to reference identification in previous natural language systems were found to be less elaborate than people's real behavior. To model a listener's behavior, a new component was added to the traditional reference identification mechanism to resolve difficulties in a speaker's description. Keywords: Artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, natural language understanding, knowledge representation, miscommunication, discourse, KL-ONE."

In the previous part we developed the basic form of the model and showed how it accounts for several of the fundamental phenomena of work perception. In this part, we first present a number of new experiments and show how the model accounts for these experiments. Then we propose a number of extensions of the model to such cases as spoken input, pronunciation tasks, and words embedded in sentential context. Finally, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the model, pointing out further possible extensions of the model to account for aspects of word perception currently ignored. The new experiments all revolve around what we call the 'context enhancement effect.' These experiments are designed to assess the roles of direct and indirect evidence concerning the identity of a letter in an input string."

                "text": "Conventional programming languages are growing ever more enormous, but not stronger. Inherent defects at the most basic level cause them to be both fat and weak: their primitive word-at-a-time style of programming inherited from their common ancestor\u2014the von Neumann computer, their close coupling of semantics to state transitions, their division of programming into a world of expressions and a world of statements, their inability to effectively use powerful combining forms for building new programs from existing ones, and their lack of useful mathematical properties for reasoning about programs.\nAn alternative functional style of programming is founded on the use of combining forms for creating programs. Functional programs deal with structured data, are often nonrepetitive and nonrecursive, are hierarchically constructed, do not name their arguments, and do not require the complex machinery of procedure declarations to become generally applicable. Combining forms can use high level programs to build still higher level ones in a style not possible in conventional languages.\nAssociated with the functional style of programming is an algebra of programs whose variables range over programs and whose operations are combining forms. This algebra can be used to transform programs and to solve equations whose \u201cunknowns\u201d are programs in much the same way one transforms equations in high school algebra. These transformations are given by algebraic laws and are carried out in the same language in which programs are written. Combining forms are chosen not only for their programming power but also for the power of their associated algebraic laws. General theorems of the algebra give the detailed behavior and termination conditions for large classes of programs.\n A new class of computing systems uses the functional programming style both in its programming language and in its state transition rules. Unlike von Neumann languages, these systems have semantics loosely coupled to states\u2014only one state transition occurs per major computation."

                "text": "Abstract The computational view of mind rests on certain intuitions regarding the fundamental similarity between computation and cognition. We examine some of these intuitions and suggest that they derive from the fact that computers and human organisms are both physical systems whose behavior is correctly described as being governed by rules acting on symbolic representations. Some of the implications of this view are discussed. It is suggested that a fundamental hypothesis of this approach (the \u201cproprietary vocabulary hypothesis\u201d) is that there is a natural domain of human functioning (roughly what we intuitively associate with perceiving, reasoning, and acting) that can be addressed exclusively in terms of a formal symbolic or algorithmic vocabulary or level of analysis. Much of the paper elaborates various conditions that need to be met if a literal view of mental activity as computation is to serve as the basis for explanatory theories. The coherence of such a view depends on there being a principled distinction between functions whose explanation requires that we posit internal representations and those that we can appropriately describe as merely instantiating causal physical or biological laws. In this paper the distinction is empirically grounded in a methodological criterion called the \u201ccognitive impenetrability condition.\u201d Functions are said to be cognitively impenetrable if they cannot be influenced by such purely cognitive factors as goals, beliefs, inferences, tacit knowledge, and so on. Such a criterion makes it possible to empirically separate the fixed capacities of mind (called its \u201cfunctional architecture\u201d) from the particular representations and algorithms used on specific occasions. In order for computational theories to avoid being ad hoc, they must deal effectively with the \u201cdegrees of freedom\u201d problem by constraining the extent to which they can be arbitrarily adjusted post hoc to fit some particular set of observations. This in turn requires that the fixed architectural function and the algorithms be independently validated. It is argued that the architectural assumptions implicit in many contemporary models run afoul of the cognitive impenetrability condition, since the required fixed functions are demonstrably sensitive to tacit knowledge and goals. The paper concludes with some tactical suggestions for the development of computational cognitive theories."

Although I strongly believed in the approach it outlined, somehow it didn\u2019t have the convincingness on paper that it had in my own reflection. After some discouraging attempts at reorganization and rewriting, I realized that there was a mismatch between the nature of what I wanted to say and the form in which I was trying to communicate. The understanding on which it was based does not have the form of a carefully structured framework into which all of cognitive science can be placed. It is more an orientation-a way of approaching the phenomena-that has grown out of many different experiences and influences and that bears the marks of its history. I found myself wanting to describe a path rather than justify its destination, finding that in the flow, the ideas came across more clearly. Since this collection was envisioned as a panorama of contrasting individual views, I have taken the liberty of making this chapter explicitly personal and describing the evolution of my own understanding. My interests have centered around natural language. I have been engaged in the design of computer programs that in some sense could be said to \u201cunderstand language, \u2019 \u2019 and this has led to looking at many aspects of the problems, including theories of meaning, representation formalisms, and the design and construction of complex computer systems. There has been a continuous evolution in my understanding of just what it means to say that a person or computer \u201cunderstands,\u201d and this story\u2019 can be read as recounting that evolution.

This raises questions like: How is information represented? How is it stored? How is it retrieved? Then, how is it used? This paper tries to deal with all these at once. When you get an idea and want to remember it, you create a K-line for it. When later activated, the K-line induces a partial mental state resembling the one that created it. A partial mental state is a subset of those mental agencies operating at one moment. This view leads to many ideas about the development, structure and physiology of memory, and about how to implement framelike representations in a distributed processor."

HSII is intended to represent a problem-solving organization which is applicable for implementation in a parallel hardware environment such as C.mmp (Bell et al [2]). The primary characteristics of this organization include: 1) multiple, diverse, independent and asynchronously executing knowledge sources (KS's), 2) cooperating (in terms of control) via a generalized form of the hypothesize-and-test paradigm involving the data-directed invocation of KS processes, and 3) communicating (in terms of data) via a shared blackboard-like data base in which the current data state is held in a homogeneous, multidimensional, directed-graph structure. The object of this paper is to explore several of the ramifications of such a problem-solving organization by examining the mechanisms and policies underlying HSII which are necessary for supporting its organization as a multiprocessing system. In addition, a multiprocessor simulation study is presented which details the effects of actually implementing such a parallel organization for use in a particular application area, that of speech understanding."

HSII is intended to represent a problem-solving organization which is applicable for implementation in a multiprocessing environment, and is, in particular, currently being implemented on the C.mmp multiprocessor system (Bell, et al., 1971) at Carnegie-Mellon University. The object of this paper is to explore several of the ramifications of such a problem-solving organization by examining the mechanisms and policies underlying HSII which are necessary for supporting its organization as a multiprocessing problem-solving system. First, an abstract description of a class of problem-solving systems is given using the Production System model of Newell (1973). Then, the HSII problem-solving organization is described in terms of this model. The various decisions made during the course of design necessitated the introduction of various multiprocessing mechanisms (e.g., mechanisms for maintaining data localization and data integrity), and these mechanisms are discussed. Finally, a simulation study is presented which details the effects of actually implementing such a problem-solving organization for use in a particular application area, that of speech understanding."
