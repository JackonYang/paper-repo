Several component processes of a recognition system for isolated offline cursive script words are described. A word image is transformed through a hierarchy of representation levels: points, contours, features, letters, and words. A unique feature representation is generated bottom-up from the image using statistical dependences between letters and features. Ratings for partially formed words are computed using a stack algorithm and a lexicon represented as a trie. Several novel techniques for low- and intermediate-level processing for cursive script are described, including heuristics for reference line finding, letter segmentation based on detecting local minima along the lower contour and areas with low vertical profiles, simultaneous encoding of contours and their topological relationships, extracting features, and finding shape-oriented events. Experiments demonstrating the performance of the system are also described. >"

On the graph representation of a word, a regular feature, the \u201caxis,\u201d is found; it allows to segment the word representation and to obtain a descriptive chain. Examples of such symbolic descriptions are given, with their interpretation as a word among a list of 25 words. The results are of the order of 87% success, 3% substitution on one handwriting.

For English text, which is the focus of the present research, the states can be identified with the letters of the alphabet, and the optimum symbols can be generated. In order to do so, a quantitative definition of symbols, in terms of features, is required. Fourteen features (some old, some new) are proposed for this task. Using the existing statistical knowledge about the English language, the calculation of the model parameters is immensely simplified. Once the model is established, the Viterbi algorithm is proposed to recognize the single best optimal state sequence, i.e. sequence of letters comprising the word. The modification of the recognition algorithm to accommodate context information is also discussed. Some experimental results are provided indicating the success of the new scheme.<<ETX>>"

It is useful both to diminish drastically the amount of data to be handled, and to simplify the computational procedures required for description and classification purposes. Thinning a digital figure down to its skeleton is a time-consuming process when conventional sequential computers are employed. The procedure we propose allows one to speed up the thinning transformation, and to get a well-shaped skeleton. After cleaning of the input picture has been performed, the pixels of the figure are labeled according to their distance from the background, and a set, whose pixels are symmetrically placed with respect to distinct contour parts of the figure, is found. This set is then given a linear structure by applying topology preserving removal operations. Finally, a pruning step, regarding branches not relevant in the framework of the problem domain, completes the process. The resulting skeleton is a labeled set of pixels which is shown to possess all the required properties, particularly those concerning connectedness, topology, and shape. Moreover, the original figure can almost completely be recovered by means of a reverse distance transformation. Only a fixed and small number of sequential passes through the picture is necessary to achieve the goal. The computational effort is rather modest, and the use of the proposed algorithm turns out to be more advantageous the greater the width of the figure to be thinned."

The input signal x(n) is filtered with M linear phase FIR filters, and the output of the FMH filter is the median of the outputs of the FIR filters. The statistical properties of the FMH filters are analyzed for input signals with Gaussian, double exponential, and uniform density functions. It is shown that FMH filters have essentially the same statistical properties and same type of root signals as the standard median (SM) filters. FMH filters preserve corner points and ramps and attenuate impulsive-type noise components effectively. An interesting subclass of the FMH filters requiring only one scaling multiplier, two additions, and three compare/swap operations irrespective of the filter length is introduced. In the examples, speed improvement by a factor of 450 is obtained over an otherwise approximately equivalent SM filter."

First, using contour tracing, thinning can be fulfilled in less than two scans of image. Due to the notion of associated point defined, fire propagation and quenching are simulated in discrete space. This simulation makes it possible to find quench points without neighborhood testing, and the computing complexity is almost minimized. Second, protrusion analysis makes the method capable of eliminating nonsignificant branches of skeleton. Moreover, like median-axis transformation, the obtained skeletons are labelled by quench function. Thus the method is suitable for practical applications.<<ETX>>"
