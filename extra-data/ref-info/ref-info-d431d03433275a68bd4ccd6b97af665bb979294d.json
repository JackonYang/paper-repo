The parser consists of a skeletal structure-building mechanism that operates in conjunction with a linguistically-based constraint module, passing control back and forth until a set of underspecified skeletal phrase-structures is converted into a fully instantiated parse tree. The modularity of the parsing design accommodates linguistic generalization, reduces the grammar size, allows extension to other languages, and is compatible with studies of human language processing."

                "text": "In Government-Binding (GB) theory, the chief empirical effect of the principle Move-\u03b1 is the definition of coindexing relations between nodes in phrase structure trees. This situation is explained by the extreme generality of the base component and several substantive constraints on transformations. The constraints on transformations, in particular Emonds\u2019 (1976) Structure Preserving Hypothesis, imply that the base may generate all S-structures of the core constructions of the language in question. The two conditions combine with a shift away from a grammatical model with both conditions on derivations, such as transformational rule ordering, and conditions on representations, such as the Subjacency condition on adjacent chain elements, to a grammatical model that favors representations.1 It follows that the principal function of Move-\u03b1 in the grammar is not reordering or otherwise rewriting of an input phrase marker for the derivation of S-structure, but rather the above noted establishment of coindexing relations between the nodes in the output representation. The relations in question are trace-antecedent relations. This trend in the role of Move-\u03b1 in the grammar has been noted in the literature, especially by Koster (1978), Chomsky (1982), and Barss (1983)."

Today the field is more active than ever before. \"Introduction to the Theory of Grammar\" makes available to teachers and students of syntax a comprehensive critical review of the main results of present day grammatical theory and shows how they were achieved. It presents the central questions, shows how and why they were asked, what the answers were, and how these have led to new questions.Part I discusses the way in which the overly rich, descriptive rule systems of the fifties and sixties have gradually been replaced by simpler, more constrained rule systems. Much of the work originally done by stipulations in the rules themselves has been taken over by general, universal principles which govern the form and functioning of these rules and the properties of their inputs and outputs. The establishment of such a theory of principles is the main topic of Part II.Part III addresses the problem of how semantics fits into grammar and elaborates a conception of how the syntactic properties of logical representations can be integrated into the overall theory of grammar. The rules and principles of grammar developed in these parts account for grammatical phenomena in an essentially modular way, and this system of modules, which constitutes the study of grammar today, is established in Part IV.An Epilogue describes such current developments as generalized binding, phrase structure, small clauses, tree geometry and NP-structure.Henk van Riemsdijk is full professor in the Department of Language and Literature, Tilburg University, Holland. Edwin Williams is professor of linguistics, University of Massachusetts, Amherst. \"Introduction to the Theory of Grammar\" is twelfth in the series Current Studies in Linguistics."

It applies the recently developed computer science tool of complexity theory to the study of natural language. A unified and coherent account emerges of how complexity theory can probe the information-processing structure of grammars, discovering why a grammar is easy or difficult to process and suggesting where to look for additional grammatical constraints. \nFor the linguist or cognitive scientist, the book presents a nontechnical introduction to complexity theory and discusses its strengths, its weaknesses, and how it can be used to study grammars. For the computer scientist, it offers a more sophisticated and efficient computational analysis of linguistic theories. Given the variety of new techniques rising from complexity theory, the authors foresee a developing cooperation among linguists, cognitive scientists, and computer scientists toward understanding the nature of human language. \nThe book also describes a set of case studies that use complexity theory to analyze grammatical problems. And it examines several grammatical systems currently of interest to computational linguists - including spelling-change/dictionary lookup and morphological analysis, agreement processes in natural language, and lexical-functional grammar - demonstrating how complexity analysis can illuminate and improve each one. \nAll of the authors are at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

It examines issues in the design of parallel systems and show why the actor model is suitable for exploiting large-scale parallelism. Concurrency in actors is constrained only by the availability of hardware resources and by the logical dependence inherent in the computation. Unlike dataflow and functional programming, however, actors are dynamically reconfigurable and can model shared resources with changing local state. Concurrency is spawned in actors using asynchronous message-passing, pipelining, and the dynamic creation of actors. The author defines an abstract actor machine and provide a minimal programming language for it. A more expressive language, which includes higher level constructs such as delayed and eager evaluation, can be defined in terms of the primitives. Examples are given to illustrate the ease with which concurrent data and control structures can be programmed. This thesis deals with some central issues in distributed computing. Specifically, problems of divergence and deadlock are addressed. Additional keywords: Object oriented programming; Semantics."
