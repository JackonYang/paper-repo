This new formulation includes a relaxation of the mass conservation constraint and a regularization term. These two features are crucial for image processing tasks where one must take into account families of multimodal histograms with large mass variation across modes. The corresponding relaxed and regularized transportation problem is the solution of a convex optimization problem. Depending on the regularization used, this minimization can be solved using standard linear programming methods or first order proximal splitting schemes. The resulting transportation plan can be used as a color transfer map, which is robust to mass variation across image color palettes. Furthermore, the regularization of the transport plan helps remove colorization artifacts due to noise amplification. We also extend this framework to compute the barycenter of distributions. The barycenter is the solution of an optimization problem, which is separately convex with respect to the barycenter and the transportation plans, but not jointly convex. A block coordinate descent scheme converges to a stationary point of the energy. We show that the resulting algorithm can be used for color normalization across several images. The relaxed and regularized barycenter defines a common color palette for those images. Applying color transfer toward this average palette performs a color normalization of the input images."

Metric data can be important in various settings, for example, in clustering, classification, metric-based indexing, query processing, and graph theoretic approximation algorithms. This paper formulates and solves the metric nearness problem: Given a set of pairwise dissimilarities, find a \u201cnearest\u201d set of distances that satisfy the properties of a metric\u2014principally the triangle inequality. For solving this problem, the paper develops efficient triangle fixing algorithms that are based on an iterative projection method. An intriguing aspect of the metric nearness problem is that a special case turns out to be equivalent to the all pairs shortest paths problem. The paper exploits this equivalence and develops a new algorithm for the latter problem using a primal-dual method. Applications to graph clustering are provided as an illustration. We include experiments that demonstrate the computational superiority of triangle fixing over general purpose convex programming software. Finally, we conclude by suggesting various useful extensions and generalizations to metric nearness."

However due to the complexity of computing the exact minimum cost matching, previous algorithms could only run efficiently when using a limited number of features per shape, and could not scale to perform retrievals from large databases. We present a contour matching algorithm that quickly computes the minimum weight matching between sets of descriptive local features using a recently introduced low-distortion embedding of the earth mover's distance (EMD) into a normed space. Given a novel embedded contour, the nearest neighbors in a database of embedded contours are retrieved in sublinear time via approximate nearest neighbors search with locality-sensitive hashing (LSH). We demonstrate our shape matching method on a database of 136,500 images of human figures. Our method achieves a speedup of four orders of magnitude over the exact method, at the cost of only a 4% reduction in accuracy."

The algorithm transforms the flow-network of the EMD so that the number of edges is reduced by an order of magnitude. As a result, we compute the EMD by an order of magnitude faster than the original algorithm, which makes it possible to compute the EMD on large histograms and databases. In addition, we show that EMDs with thresholded ground distances have many desirable properties. First, they correspond to the way humans perceive distances. Second, they are robust to outlier noise and quantization effects. Third, they are metrics. Finally, experimental results on image retrieval show that thresholding the ground distance of the EMD improves both accuracy and speed."

We present a novel linear time algorithm for approximating the EMD for low dimensional histograms using the sum of absolute values of the weighted wavelet coefficients of the difference histogram. EMD computation is a special case of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein transshipment problem, and we exploit the Holder continuity constraint in its dual form to convert it into a simple optimization problem with an explicit solution in the wavelet domain. We prove that the resulting wavelet EMD metric is equivalent to EMD, i.e. the ratio of the two is bounded. We also provide estimates for the bounds. The weighted wavelet transform can be computed in time linear in the number of histogram bins, while the comparison is about as fast as for normal Euclidean distance or chi2 statistic. We experimentally show that wavelet EMD is a good approximation to EMD, has similar performance, but requires much less computation."

                "text": "We propose EMD-L1: a fast and exact algorithm for computing the earth mover's distance (EMD) between a pair of histograms. The efficiency of the new algorithm enables its application to problems that were previously prohibitive due to high time complexities. The proposed EMD-L1 significantly simplifies the original linear programming formulation of EMD. Exploiting the L1 metric structure, the number of unknown variables in EMD-L1 is reduced to O(N) from O(N2) of the original EMD for a histogram with N bins. In addition, the number of constraints is reduced by half and the objective function of the linear program is simplified. Formally, without any approximation, we prove that the EMD-L1 formulation is equivalent to the original EMD with a L1 ground distance. To perform the EMD-L1 computation, we propose an efficient tree-based algorithm, Tree-EMD. Tree-EMD exploits the fact that a basic feasible solution of the simplex algorithm-based solver forms a spanning tree when we interpret EMD-L1 as a network flow optimization problem. We empirically show that this new algorithm has an average time complexity of O(N2), which significantly improves the best reported supercubic complexity of the original EMD. The accuracy of the proposed methods is evaluated by experiments for two computation-intensive problems: shape recognition and interest point matching using multidimensional histogram-based local features. For shape recognition, EMD-L1 is applied to compare shape contexts on the widely tested MPEG7 shape data set, as well as an articulated shape data set. For interest point matching, SIFT, shape context and spin image are tested on both synthetic and real image pairs with large geometrical deformation, illumination change, and heavy intensity noise. The results demonstrate that our EMD-L1-based solutions outperform previously reported state-of-the-art features and distance measures in solving the two tasks"

It is becoming increasingly apparent that a full understanding of a class of convex polyhedra requires the knowledge of both of these characterizations. Perhaps the earliest and neatest example of this is the class of doubly stochastic matrices. This polyhedron can be defined by the system of equations Birkhoff [2] and Von Neuman have shown that the extreme points of this bounded polyhedron are just the n \u00d7 n permutation matrices. The importance of this result for mathematical programming is that it tells us that the maximum of any linear form over P will occur for a permutation matrix X."

A Manhattan network on S can be thought of as a graph G = (V,E) where the vertex set V corresponds to the points of S and a set of Steiner points S\u2032. The edges in E correspond to horizontal and vertical line segments connecting points in S \u222a S\u2032. A Manhattan network can also be thought of as a 1-spanner (for the L1-metric) for the points in S. We will show that there is a Manhattan network on S with O(n log n) vertices and edges which can be constructed in O(n log n) time. This allows us to to compute the L1-Earth Mover\u2019s Distance on weighted planar point sets in O(n log n) time, which improves the currently best known result of O(n log n). At the expense of a slightly higher time and space complexity we are able to extend our approach to any dimension d \u2265 3. We will further show that our construction is optimal in the sense that there are point sets in the plane where every Manhattan network needs \u03a9(n log n) vertices and edges."

In particular, general purpose computing on GPUs (GPGPU) is attracting attention among researchers and practitioners alike. Yet GPGPU research is still in its infancy, and a major challenge is to rearrange existing algorithms so as to obtain a significant performance gain from the execution on a GPU. In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting an efficient GPU implementation of a very popular algorithm for linear programming, the revised simplex method. We describe how to carry out the steps of the revised simplex method to take full advantage of the parallel processing capabilities of a GPU. Our experiments demonstrate considerable speedup over a widely used CPU implementation, thus underlining the tremendous potential of GPGPU."
