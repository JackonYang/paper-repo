                "text": "Recently there has been increasing interest in using neural networks for language modeling. In contrast to the well-known backoff n-gram language models, the neural network approach tries to limit the data sparseness problem by performing the estimation in a continuous space, allowing by this means smooth interpolations. The complexity to train such a model and to calculate one n-gram probability is however several orders of magnitude higher than for the backoff models, making the new approach difficult to use in real applications. In this paper several techniques are presented that allow the use of a neural network language model in a large vocabulary speech recognition system, in particular very, fast lattice rescoring and efficient training of large neural networks on training corpora of over 10 million words. The described approach achieves significant word error reductions with respect to a carefully tuned 4-gram backoff language model in a state of the art conversational speech recognizer for the DARPA rich transcriptions evaluations."

                "text": "A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts."

In this paper we propose to address this problem by carrying out the estimation task in a continuous space, enabling a smooth interpolation of the probabilities. A neural network is used to learn the projection of the words onto a continuous space and to estimate the n-gram probabilities. The connectionist language model is being evaluated on the DARPA HUB5 conversational telephone speech recognition task and preliminary results show consistent improvements in both perplexity and word error rate."

The connectionist models use a distributed representation of the items in the history and make much better use of contexts than currently used interpolated or back-off models, not only because of the inherent capability of the connectionist model in fighting the data sparseness problem, but also because of the sublinear growth in the model size when the context length is increased. The connectionist models can be further trained by an EM procedure, similar to the previously used procedure for training the SLM. Our experiments show that the connectionist models can significantly improve the PPL over the interpolated and back-off models on the UPENN Treebank corpora, after interpolating with a baseline trigram language model. The EM training procedure can improve the connectionist models further, by using hidden events obtained by the SLM parser."

The modules communicate using these representations, which are global and publicly available in the system. The representations are developed automatically by all networks while they are learning their processing tasks. The resulting representations reflect the regularities in the subtasks, which facilitates robust processing in the face of noise and damage, supports improved generalization, and provides expectations about possible contexts. The lexicon can be extended by cloning new instances of the items, that is, by generating a number of items with known processing properties and distinct identities. This technique combinatorially increases the processing power of the system. The recurrent FGREP module, together with a central lexicon, is used as a basic building block in modeling higher level natural language tasks. A single module is used to form case-role representations of sentences from word-by-word sequential natural language input. A hierarchical organization of four recurrent FGREP modules (the DISPAR system) is trained to produce fully expanded paraphrases of script-based stories, where unmentioned events and role fillers are inferred."

Unfortunately, long training times make maximum entropy research difficult. We present a speedup technique: we change the form of the model to use classes. Our speedup works by creating two maximum entropy models, the first of which predicts the class of each word, and the second of which predicts the word itself. This factoring of the model leads to fewer nonzero indicator functions, and faster normalization, achieving speedups of up to a factor of 35 over one of the best previous techniques. It also results in typically slightly lower perplexities. The same trick can be used to speed training of other machine learning techniques, e.g. neural networks, applied to any problem with a large number of outputs, such as language modeling."

The modules communicate using these representations, which are global and publicly available in the system. The representations are developed automatically by all networks while they are learning their processing tasks. The resulting representations reflect the regularities in the subtasks, which facilitates robust processing in the face of noise and damage, supports improved generalization, and provides expectations about possible contexts. The lexicon can be extended by cloning new instances of the items, that is, by generating a number of items with known processing properties and distinct identities. This technique combinatorially increases the processing power of the system. The recurrent FGREP module, together with a central lexicon, is used as a basic building block in modeling higher level natural language tasks. A single module is used to form case-role representations of sentences from word-by-word sequential natural language input. A hierarchical organization of four recurrent FGREP modules (the DISPAR system) is trained to produce fully expanded paraphrases of script-based stories, where unmentioned events and role fillers are inferred."

We present explorations of variations on, or of the limits of, each of these techniques, including showing that sentence mixture models may have more potential. While all of these techniques have been studied separately, they have rarely been studied in combination. We compare a combination of all techniques together to a Katz smoothed trigram model with no count cutoffs. We achieve perplexity reductions between 38 and 50% (1 bit of entropy), depending on training data size, as well as a word error rate reduction of 8.9%. Our perplexity reductions are perhaps the highest reported compared to a fair baseline."

The category-based model employs variable-length n-grams and permits each word to belong to multiple categories. Relative word error rate reductions of between 2 and 7% over the baseline are achieved in N-best rescoring experiments on the Wall Street Journal corpus. The largest improvement is obtained with a model using automatically determined categories. Perplexities continue to decrease as the number of different categories is increased, but improvements in the word error rate reach an optimum."

Clusters are represented by average context distributions derived from the given words according to their probabilities of cluster membership. In many cases, the clusters can be thought of as encoding coarse sense distinctions. Deterministic annealing is used to find lowest distortion sets of clusters: as the annealing parameter increases, existing clusters become unstable and subdivide, yielding a hierarchical \"soft\" clustering of the data.

We present a maximum-likelihood approach for automatically constructing maximum entropy models and describe how to implement this approach efficiently, using as examples several problems in natural language processing."

One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by Jordan (1986) which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction."

This approach clusters words into groups based on the distribution of class labels associated with each word. Thus, unlike some other unsupervised dimensionalityreduction techniques, such as Latent Semantic Indexing, we are able to compress the feature space much more aggressively, while still maintaining high document classification accuracy. Experimental results obtained on three real-world data sets show that we can reduce the feature dimensional&y by three orders of magnitude and lose only 2% accuracy-significantly better than Latent Semantic Indexing [6], class-based clustering [l], feature selection by mutual information [23], or Markov-blanket-based feature selection [13]. We also show that less aggressive clustering sometimes results in improved classification accuracy over classification without clustering."

This way of combining individual expert models makes it hard to generate samples from the combined model but easy to infer the values of the latent variables of each expert, because the combination rule ensures that the latent variables of different experts are conditionally independent when given the data. A product of experts (PoE) is therefore an interesting candidate for a perceptual system in which rapid inference is vital and generation is unnecessary. Training a PoE by maximizing the likelihood of the data is difficult because it is hard even to approximate the derivatives of the renormalization term in the combination rule. Fortunately, a PoE can be trained using a different objective function called contrastive divergence whose derivatives with regard to the parameters can be approximated accurately and efficiently. Examples are presented of contrastive divergence learning using several types of expert on several types of data."

The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents (\u201csemantic structure\u201d) in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca. 100 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising."
