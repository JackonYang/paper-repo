After reviewing a variety of graphical models (Markov random fields, Tanner graphs, and Bayesian networks), we derive a general distributed marginalization algorithm for functions described by factor graphs. From this general algorithm, Pearl's (1986) belief propagation algorithm is easily derived as a special case. We point out that iterative decoding algorithms for various codes, including \"turbo decoding\" of parallel-concatenated convolutional codes, may be viewed as probability propagation in a graphical model of the code. We focus on Bayesian network descriptions of codes, which give a natural input/state/output/channel description of a code and channel, and we indicate how iterative decoders can be developed for parallel-and serially concatenated coding systems, product codes, and low-density parity-check codes."

(1993) and an algorithm that has been well known in the artificial intelligence community for a decade, but which is relatively unknown to information theorists: Pearl's (1982) belief propagation algorithm. We see that if Pearl's algorithm is applied to the \"belief network\" of a parallel concatenation of two or more codes, the turbo decoding algorithm immediately results. Unfortunately, however, this belief diagram has loops, and Pearl only proved that his algorithm works when there are no loops, so an explanation of the experimental performance of turbo decoding is still lacking. However, we also show that Pearl's algorithm can be used to routinely derive previously known iterative, but suboptimal, decoding algorithms for a number of other error-control systems, including Gallager's (1962) low-density parity-check codes, serially concatenated codes, and product codes. Thus, belief propagation provides a very attractive general methodology for devising low-complexity iterative decoding algorithms for hybrid coded systems."

The constraint length K for the convolutional encoding of many of these codes (Golay, (48, 24) OR, etc.) turns out to be surprisingly small.

Here we l a y a foundation for an understanding of belief propagation in networks with loops. For networks with a single loop, we derive an analytical relationship between the steady state beliefs in the loopy network and the true posterior probability. Using this relationship we show a category of networks for which the MAP estimate obtained by belief update and by belief revision can be proven to be optimal (although the beliefs will be incorrect). We s h o w h o w nodes can use local information in the messages they receive in order to correct the steady state beliefs. Furthermore we p r o ve that for all networks with a single loop, the MAP estimate obtained by belief revision at convergence is guaranteed to give the globally optimal sequence of states. The result is independent of the length of the cycle and the size of the state space. For networks with multiple loops, we i n troduce the concept of a \\balanced network\" and show simulation results comparing belief revision and update in such networks. We show t h a t t h e T urbo code structure is balanced and present simulations on a toy T urbo code problem indicating the decoding obtained by belief revision at convergence is signiicantly more likely to be correct. A a b Figure 1: a. An example of the types of problems typically solved using belief propagation. Observed nodes are denoted by lled circles. A link between any t wo nodes implies a probabilistic compatability constraint. b. A simple network with a loop. Although belief propagation rules can be generalized to this network, a theoretical understanding of the algorithms behavior in such a n e t work has yet to be achieved."

We develop some elementary theory, and present several intriguing examples, which we hope will stimulate further developments in this field. In particular, we construct a 16-state 12-section structurally invariant tail-biting trellis for the (24, 12, 8) binary Golay code. This tail-biting trellis representation is minimal: it simultaneously minimizes all conceivable measures of state complexity. Moreover, it compares favorably with the minimal conventional 12-section trellis for the Golay code, which has 256 states at its midpoint, or with the best quasi-cyclic representation of this code, which leads to a 64-state tail-biting trellis. Unwrapping this tail-biting trellis produces a periodically time-varying 16-state rate-1/2 \"convolutional Golay code\" with d=8, which has attractive performance/complexity properties. We furthermore show that the (6, 3, 4) quaternary hexacode has a minimal 8-state group tail-biting trellis, even though it has no such linear trellis over F/sub 4/. Minimal tail-biting trellises are also constructed for the (8, 4, 4) binary Hamming code, the (4, 2, 3) ternary tetracode, the (4, 2, 3) code over F/sub 4/, and the Z/sub 4/-linear (8. 4, 4) octacode."

Previous expositions of such local computation have emphasized conditional probability. We believe this emphasis is misplaced. What is essential to local computation is a factorization. It is not essential that this factorization be interpreted in terms of conditional probabilities. The account given here avoids the divisions required by conditional probabilities and generalizes readily to alternative measures of subjective probability, such as Dempster-Shafer or Spohnian belief functions."

The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty\u0097and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition\u0097in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability."
