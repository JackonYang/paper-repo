The scope of the approach is to recognize tables contained in PDF documents as a 2-dimensional grid on a Cartesian plane and extract them as a set of cells equipped by 2-dimensional coordinates. Experiments, carried out on a dataset composed of tables contained in documents coming from different domains, shows that the approach is well performing in recognizing table cells.The approach aims at improving PDF document annotation and information extraction by providing an output that can be further processed for understanding table and document contents."

The visual separators refer to not only the graphic ruling lines but also the white spaces to handle tables with or without ruling lines. Furthermore, we detect page columns in order to assist table region delimitation in complex layout pages. Evaluations of our algorithm on an e-Book dataset and a scientific document dataset show competitive performance. It is noteworthy that the proposed method has been successfully incorporated into a commercial software package for large-scale Chinese e-Book production."

Several document analysis tasks require merging or splitting certain document elements to form others. The suitability of the commonly used precision and recall for such division/aggregation tasks is arguable, since their underlying assumption is that the granularity of the items at input is the same as at output. We propose a new pair of evaluation metrics that better suit document analysis\u2019 needs and show their application to several table tasks. In the process, we present a number of robust table location algorithms with which we draw a road-map for creating Hidden Markov Models for the task."

In order to allow efficient access of this information, the content of the documents must be stored in database and information retrieval systems. State-of-the-art indexing techniques mostly rely on the information explicitly available in the text portions of documents. Documents usually contain a significant amount of implicit information such as their logical structure which is not directly accessible (unless the documents are available as well-structured XML-files) and is therefore not used in the search process. In this paper, a new approach for analyzing the logical structure of text documents is presented. The problem of state-of-the-art methods is that they have been developed for a particular type of documents and can only handle documents of that type. In most cases, adaptation and re-training for a different document type is not possible. Our proposed method allows an efficient and effective adaptation of the structure analysis process by combining state-of-the-art machine learning with novel interactive visualization techniques, allowing a quick adaptation of the structure analysis process to unknown document classes and new tasks without requiring a predefined training set."

                "text": "Tables are ubiquitous in digital libraries. In scientific documents, tables are widely used to present experimental results or statistical data in a condensed fashion. However, current search engines do not support table search. The difficulty of automatic extracting tables from un-tagged documents, the lack of a universal table metadata specification, and the limitation of the existing ranking schemes make table search problem challenging. In this paper, we describe TableSeer, a search engine for tables. TableSeer crawls digital libraries, detects tables from documents, extracts tables metadata, indexes and ranks tables, and provides a user-friendly search interface. We propose an extensive set of medium-independent metadata for tables that scientists and other users can adopt for representing table information. In addition, we devise a novel page box-cutting method to improve the performance of the table detection. Given a query, TableSeer ranks the matched tables using an innovative ranking algorithm - TableRank. TableRank rates each \u20edquery, table\u2102 pair with a tailored vector space model and a specific term weighting scheme. Overall, TableSeer eliminates the burden of manually extract table data from digital libraries and enables users to automatically examine tables. We demonstrate the value of TableSeer with empirical studies on scientific documents."

We present a novel compact visualization which represents the document's key semantic as a mixture of images and important key terms, similar to cards in a top trumps game. The key terms are extracted using an advanced text mining approach based on a fully automatic document structure extraction. The images and their captions are extracted using a graphical heuristic and the captions are used for a semi-semantic image weighting. Furthermore, we use the image color histogram for classification and show at least one representative from each non-empty image class. The approach is demonstrated for the IEEE InfoVis publications of a complete year. The method can easily be applied to other publication collections and sets of documents which contain images."

Our algorithm works bottom-up by grouping word bounding boxes into larger groups and uses a set of heuristics. It has already been implemented and a preliminary evaluation on about 6000 Web documents has been carried out."

This paper shows how dataflow properties can be analyzed at compile-time to make buffering more efficient. Since the target code corresponding to each node of an SDF graph is normally obtained from a hand-optimized library of predefined blocks, the efficiency of data transfer between blocks is often the limiting factor in how closely an SDF compiler can approximate meticulous manual coding. Furthermore, in the presence of large sample-rate changes, straightforward buffering techniques can quickly exhaust limited on-chip data memory, necessitating the use of slower external memory. The techniques presented in this paper address both of these problems in a unified manner."
