Following a common consensus in the field, we do not assume that a figure- ground segmentation is available prior to recognition. However, in contrast to most standard approaches for object class recognition, our approach automati- cally segments the object as a result of the categorization. This combination of recognition and segmentation into one process is made pos- sible by our use of an Implicit Shape Model, which integrates both into a common probabilistic framework. In addition to the recognition and segmentation result, it also generates a per-pixel confidence measure specifying the area that supports a hypothesis and how much it can be trusted. We use this confidence to derive a nat- ural extension of the approach to handle multiple objects in a scene and resolve ambiguities between overlapping hypotheses with a novel MDL-based criterion. In addition, we present an extensive evaluation of our method on a standard dataset for car detection and compare its performance to existing methods from the literature. Our results show that the proposed method significantly outper- forms previously published methods while needing one order of magnitude less training examples. Finally, we present results for articulated objects, which show that the proposed method can categorize and segment unfamiliar objects in differ- ent articulations and with widely varying texture patterns, even under significant partial occlusion."

Specifically, we utilize distinctive intermediate-level features in this case automatically extracted 2-D boundary fragments, as keys, which are then verified within a local contest, and assembled within a loose global contest to evoke an overall percept. This system demonstrates good recognition of a variety of 3-D shapes, ranging from sports cars and fighter planes to snakes and lizards with full orthographic invariance. We report the results of large-scale tests, involving over 2000 separate test images, that evaluate performance with increasing number of items in the database, in the presence of clutter, background change, and occlusion, and also the results of some generic classification experiments where the system is tested on objects never previously seen or modeled. To our knowledge, the results we report are the best in the literature for full-sphere tests of general shapes with occlusion and clutter resistance."

However, the more challenging and important task of categorizing previously unseen objects remains largely unsolved. Traditionally, contour and shape based methods are regarded most adequate for handling the generalization requirements needed for this task. Appearance based methods, on the other hand, have been successful in object identification and detection scenarios. Today little work is done to systematically compare existing methods and characterize their relative capabilities for categorizing objects. In order to compare different methods we present a new database specifically tailored to the task of object categorization. It contains high-resolution color images of 80 objects from 8 different categories, for a total of 3280 images. It is used to analyze the performance of several appearance and contour based methods. The best categorization result is obtained by an appropriate combination of different methods."

                "text": "The perceptual recognition of objects is conceptualized to be a process in which the image of the input is segmented at regions of deep concavity into an arrangement of simple geometric components, such as blocks, cylinders, wedges, and cones. The fundamental assumption of the proposed theory, recognition-by-components (RBC), is that a modest set of generalized-cone components, called geons (N \u00a3 36), can be derived from contrasts of five readily detectable properties of edges in a two-dimensiona l image: curvature, collinearity, symmetry, parallelism, and cotermination. The detection of these properties is generally invariant over viewing position an$ image quality and consequently allows robust object perception when the image is projected from a novel viewpoint or is degraded. RBC thus provides a principled account of the heretofore undecided relation between the classic principles of perceptual organization and pattern recognition: The constraints toward regularization (Pragnanz) characterize not the complete object but the object's components. Representational power derives from an allowance of free combinations of the geons. A Principle of Componential Recovery can account for the major phenomena of object recognition: If an arrangement of two or three geons can be recovered from the input, objects can be quickly recognized even when they are occluded, novel, rotated in depth, or extensively degraded. The results from experiments on the perception of briefly presented pictures by human observers provide empirical support for the theory. Any single object can project an infinity of image configurations to the retina. The orientation of the object to the viewer can vary continuously, each giving rise to a different two-dimensional projection. The object can be occluded by other objects or texture fields, as when viewed behind foliage. The object need not be presented as a full-colored textured image but instead can be a simplified line drawing. Moreover, the object can even be missing some of its parts or be a novel exemplar of its particular category. But it is only with rare exceptions that an image fails to be rapidly and readily classified, either as an instance of a familiar object category or as an instance that cannot be so classified (itself a form of classification)."

The variability within a class is represented by a join probability density function on the shape of the constellation and the appearance of the parts. Our method automatically identifies distinctive features in the training set. The set of model parameters is then learned using expectation maximization. When trained on different, unlabeled and unsegmented views of a class of objects, each component of the mixture model can adapt to represent a subset of the views. Similarly, different component models can also \"specialize\" on sub-classes of an object class. Experiments on images of human heads, leaves from different species of trees, and motor-cars demonstrate that the method works well over a wide variety of objects."

                "text": "Severe architectural and timing constraints within the primate visual system support the conjecture that the early phase of object recognition in the brain is based on a feedforward feature-extraction hierarchy. To assess the plausibility of this conjecture in an engineering context, a difficult three-dimensional object recognition domain was developed to challenge a pure feedforward, receptive-field based recognition model called SEEMORE. SEEMORE is based on 102 viewpoint-invariant nonlinear filters that as a group are sensitive to contour, texture, and color cues. The visual domain consists of 100 real objects of many different types, including rigid (shovel), nonrigid (telephone cord), and statistical (maple leaf cluster) objects and photographs of complex scenes. Objects were in dividually presented in color video images under normal room lighting conditions. Based on 12 to 36 training views, SEEMORE was required to recognize unnormalized test views of objects that could vary in position, orientation in the image plane and in depth, and scale (factor of 2); for non rigid objects, recognition was also tested under gross shape deformations. Correct classification performance on a test set consisting of 600 novel object views was 97 percent (chance was 1 percent) and was comparable for the subset of 15 nonrigid objects. Performance was also measured under a variety of image degradation conditions, including partial occlusion, limited clutter, color shift, and additive noise. Generalization behavior and classification errors illustrate the emergence of several striking natural shape categories that are not explicitly encoded in the dimensions of the feature space. It is concluded that in the light of the vast hardware resources available in the ventral stream of the primate visual system relative to those exercised here, the appealingly simple feature-space conjecture remains worthy of serious consideration as a neurobiological model."

To this end we develop a number of novel components. First, we introduce a new edge-based local feature detector that is invariant to similarity transformations. The features are localized on edges and a neighbourhood is estimated in a scale invariant manner. Second, the neighbourhood descriptor computed for foreground features is not affected by background clutter, even if the feature is on an object boundary. Third, the descriptor generalizes Lowe's SIFT method to edges. An object model is learnt from a single training image. The object is then recognized in new images in a series of steps which apply progressively tighter geometric restrictions. A final contribution of this work is to allow sufficient flexibility in the geometric representation that objects in the same visual class can be recognized. Results are demonstrated for various object classes including bikes and rackets."

We seek a solution that optimizes a joint grouping criterion in a reduced space enforced by grouping correspondence between pixels and patches. Using spectral graph partitioning, we show that a near global optimum can be found by solving a constrained eigenvalue problem. We report promising experimental results on a dataset of 15 objects under clutter and occlusion."

To achieve this aim, new kinds of vision algorithms need to be developed which run in real time and subserve the robot's goals. Two fundamental goals are determining the location of a known object. Color can be successfully used for both tasks.This article demonstrates that color histograms of multicolored objects provide a robust, efficient cue for indexing into a large database of models. It shows that color histograms are stable object representations in the presence of occlusion and over change in view, and that they can differentiate among a large number of objects. For solving the identification problem, it introduces a technique calledHistogram Intersection, which matches model and image histograms and a fast incremental version of Histogram Intersection, which allows real-time indexing into a large database of stored models. For solving the location problem it introduces an algorithm calledHistogram Backprojection, which performs this task efficiently in crowded scenes."

For use in a real-world system, it is important that this includes the ability to recognize objects at multiple scales. In this paper, we present an approach to multi-scale object categorization using scale-invariant interest points and a scale-adaptive Mean-Shift search. The approach builds on the method from [12], which has been demonstrated to achieve excellent results for the single-scale case, and extends it to multiple scales. We present an experimental comparison of the influence of different interest point operators and quantitatively show the method's robustness to large scale changes."

As in previous methods, we first use training images to extract fragments that contain common object parts. We then show how these parts can be segmented into their figure and ground regions in an automatic learning process. This is in contrast with previous approaches, which required complete manual segmentation of the objects in the training examples. The figure-ground learning combines top-down and bottom-up processes and proceeds in two stages, an initial approximation followed by iterative refinement. The initial approximation produces figure-ground labeling of individual image fragments using the unsegmented training images. It is based on the fact that on average, points inside the object are covered by more fragments than points outside it. The initial labeling is then improved by an iterative refinement process, which converges in up to three steps. At each step, the figure-ground labeling of individual fragments produces a segmentation of complete objects in the training images, which in turn induce a refined figure-ground labeling of the individual fragments. In this manner, we obtain a scheme that starts from unsegmented training images, learns the figure-ground labeling of image fragments, and then uses this labeling to segment novel images. Our experiments demonstrate that the learned segmentation achieves the same level of accuracy as methods using manual segmentation of training images, producing an automatic and robust top-down segmentation."

We present a simple method for image description based on histograms of qualitative shape indexes computed from the combination of triplets of sampled locations and gradient directions in the image. We demonstrate that this method indeed is able to capture variation within classes of objects and we apply it to the problem of recognizing four different categories from a large database. Using our descriptor on the whole image, containing varying degrees of background clutter, we obtain results for two of the objects that are superior to the best results published so far for this database. By cropping images manually we demonstrate that our method has a potential to handle also the other objects when supplied with an algorithm for searching the image. We argue that our method, based on qualitative image properties, capture the large range of variation that is typically encountered within an object class. This means that our method can be used on substantially larger patches of images than existing methods based on simpler criteria for evaluating image similarity."

The technique is demonstrated by developing a system that locates people in cluttered scenes. The system is structured with four distinct example-based detectors that are trained to separately find the four components of the human body: the head, legs, left arm, and right arm. After ensuring that these components are present in the proper geometric configuration, a second example-based classifier combines the results of the component detectors to classify a pattern as either a \"person\" or a \"nonperson.\" We call this type of hierarchical architecture, in which learning occurs at multiple stages, an adaptive combination of classifiers (ACC). We present results that show that this system performs significantly better than a similar full-body person detector. This suggests that the improvement in performance is due to the component-based approach and the ACC data classification architecture. The algorithm is also more robust than the full-body person detection method in that it is capable of locating partially occluded views of people and people whose body parts have little contrast with the background."

Examples of this ubiquitous problem in computer vision arise in tasks involving hand-eye coordination (such as assembling or sorting), inspection tasks, gauging operations, and in navigation and localization of mobile robots. This book describes an extended series of experiments into the role of geometry in the critical area of object recognition. It provides precise definitions of the recognition and localization problems, describes the methods used to address them, analyzes the solutions to these problems, and addresses the implications of this analysis.The solution to problems of object recognition are of fundamental importance in many real applications and versions of the techniques described here are already being used in industrial settings. Although a number of questions remain to be solved, the authors provide a valuable framework for understanding both the strengths and limitations of using object shape to guide recognition.W. Eric L.

This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \"integral image\" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a \"cascade\" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection."

The solution to this problem that we are pursuing is to use a computer vision system based upon motion analysis of a monocular image sequence from a mobile camera.

Appearance-based parts and relations are defined in terms of closed regions and the union of these regions, respectively. The regions are segmented using the MDL principle, and their appearance is obtained from collection of images and compactly represented by parametric manifolds in the two eigenspaces spanned by the parts and the relations."

                "text": "In this paper we describe a trainable object detector and its instantiations for detecting faces and cars at any size, location, and pose. To cope with variation in object orientation, the detector uses multiple classifiers, each spanning a different range of orientation. Each of these classifiers determines whether the object is present at a specified size within a fixed-size image window. To find the object at any location and size, these classifiers scan the image exhaustively.Each classifier is based on the statistics of localized parts. Each part is a transform from a subset of wavelet coefficients to a discrete set of values. Such parts are designed to capture various combinations of locality in space, frequency, and orientation. In building each classifier, we gathered the class-conditional statistics of these part values from representative samples of object and non-object images. We trained each classifier to minimize classification error on the training set by using Adaboost with Confidence-Weighted Predictions (Shapire and Singer, 1999). In detection, each classifier computes the part values within the image window and looks up their associated class-conditional probabilities. The classifier then makes a decision by applying a likelihood ratio test. For efficiency, the classifier evaluates this likelihood ratio in stages. At each stage, the classifier compares the partial likelihood ratio to a threshold and makes a decision about whether to cease evaluation\u2014labeling the input as non-object\u2014or to continue further evaluation. The detector orders these stages of evaluation from a low-resolution to a high-resolution search of the image. Our trainable object detector achieves reliable and efficient detection of human faces and passenger cars with out-of-plane rotation."

However, the existing approaches are based on matching to individual training images. This paper presents a method for combining multiple images of a 3D object into a single model representation. This provides for recognition of 3D objects from any viewpoint, the generalization of models to non-rigid changes, and improved robustness through the combination of features acquired under a range of imaging conditions. The decision of whether to cluster a training image into an existing view representation or to treat it as a new view is based on the geometric accuracy of the match to previous model views. A new probabilistic model is developed to reduce the false positive matches that would otherwise arise due to loosened geometric constraints on matching 3D and non-rigid models. A system has been developed based on these approaches that is able to robustly recognize 3D objects in cluttered natural images in sub-second times."

Our main contribution is a novel object representation scheme using \u2018extended fragments\u2019 that enables us to achieve a high level of recognition performance and generalization across a wide range of viewing conditions. Extended fragments are equivalence classes of image fragments that represent informative object parts under different viewing conditions. They are extracted automatically from short video sequences during learning. Using this representation, the scheme is unique in its ability to generalize from a single view of a novel object and compensate for a significant change in viewing direction without using 3D information. As a result, novel objects can be recognized from viewing directions from which they were not seen in the past. Experiments demonstrate that the scheme achieves significantly better generalization and recognition performance than previously used methods."

The object representation consists of an association of frame regions. These regions provide exemplars of the object\u2019s possible visual appearances.Two ideas are developed: (i) associating regions within a single shot to represent a deforming object; (ii) associating regions from the multiple visual aspects of a 3D object, thereby implicitly representing 3D structure. For the association we exploit temporal continuity (tracking) and wide baseline matching of affine covariant regions.In the implementation there are three areas of novelty: First, we describe a method to repair short gaps in tracks. Second, we show how to join tracks across occlusions (where many tracks terminate simultaneously). Third, we develop an affine factorization method that copes with motion degeneracy.We obtain tracks that last throughout the shot, without requiring a 3D reconstruction. The factorization method is used to associate tracks into object-level groups, with common motion. The outcome is that separate parts of an object that are not simultaneously visible (such as the front and back of a car, or the front and side of a face) are associated together. In turn this enables object-level matching and recognition throughout a video.We illustrate the method on the feature film \u201cGroundhog Day.\u201d Examples are given for the retrieval of deforming objects (heads, walking people) and rigid objects (vehicles, locations)."

The variability across a class of objects is modeled in a principled way, treating objects as flexible constellations of rigid parts (features). Variability is represented by a joint probability density function (pdf) on the shape of the constellation and the output of part detectors. Corresponding \u201cconstellation models\u201d can be learned in a completely unsupervised fashion. In a first stage, the learning method automatically identifies distinctive parts in the training set by applying a clustering algorithm to patterns selected by an interest operator. It then learns the statistical shape model using expectation maximization. Mixtures of constellation models can be defined and applied to \u201cdiscover\u201d object categories in an unsupervised manner. The method achieves very good classification results on human faces, cars, leaves, handwritten letters, and cartoon characters."

The system derives much of its power from a representation that describes an object class in terms of an overcomplete dictionary of local, oriented, multiscale intensity differences between adjacent regions, efficiently computable as a Haar wavelet transform. This example-based learning approach implicitly derives a model of an object class by training a support vector machine classifier using a large set of positive and negative examples. We present results on face, people, and car detection tasks using the same architecture. In addition, we quantify how the representation affects detection performance by considering several alternate representations including pixels and principal components. We also describe a real-time application of our person detection system as part of a driver assistance system."

We show that the method leads to markedly improved segmentation results and can deal with significant variation in shape and varying backgrounds. We discuss the relative merits of class-specific and general image-based segmentation methods and suggest how they can be usefully combined."

Efficiency comes from processing the scene only where necessary, to the level of detail necessary, and with only the necessary operators. Knowledge representation and sequential decision making are central issues for selective vision, which takes advantage of prior knowledge of a domain's abstract and geometrical structure (e.g., \u201cpart-of\u201d and \u201cadjacent\u201d relationships), and also uses information from a scene instance gathered during analysis. The TEA-1 selective vision system uses Bayes nets for representation, benefit-cost analysis for control of visual and nonvisual actions; and its data structures and decision-making algorithms provide a general, reusable framework. TEA-1 solves the T-world problem, an abstraction of a large set of scene domains and tasks. Some factors that affect the success of selective perception are analyzed by using TEA-1 to solve ensembles of randomly produced, simulated T-world problems. Experimental results with a real-world T-world problem, dinner table scenes, are also presented."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

                "text": "Semantics-based image retrieval has gained increasing interest in recent years. As an area in linguistics, semantics deals with the sense and the meaning of language. In the context of content-based image retrieval, the research goal is to access the meaning of images by naming or describing the most important image regions and their relationships. The topic of this dissertation is the semantic description, understanding, and mod-eling of natural scenes. The primary objective is to develop a computational image representation that reduces the semantic gap between the image understanding of humans and the computer. For humans, the most intuitive means of communications about images is image description. Image semantics and image description are thus closely interconnected. We propose a semantic modeling of natural scenes that is based on the classification of local semantic concepts. Image regions are extracted on a regular 10x10 grid. The resulting patches are classified into nine concept classes that subsume the main semantic content of the database images. Images are represented through the frequency of occurrence of the semantic concepts. This semantic modeling constitutes a compact, semantic image representation that allows to describe or search for specific image content, or, on a higher level, to model the semantic content of natural scene categories. The semantic modeling has been intensively studied for categorization and retrieval of natural scenes. Depending on the classification method and on the quality of the concept detectors, good to very good categorization and retrieval performance has been obtained. In particular, it is shown that the semantic modeling leads to considerably better categorization and retrieval performance compared to directly employing low-level features. Nevertheless, the analysis of the mis-categorized scenes reveals that the regular semantic ambiguity of the database images demands rather for a typicality ranking of images than for hard-decision categorization. This hypothesis is supported in two psychophysical experiments. Humans are able to consistently categorize images, but the employed database consists to a large degree of images that can be assigned to several scene categories. However, the human participants were very consistent in ranking the database images according to their semantic typicality. It is shown visually and quantitatively, that the proposed semantic modeling is also well-suited for semantic ranking of images. In particular, the typicality transition between two scene categories can be modeled. In addition, we propose a perceptually plausible distance measure that represents the most discriminant semantic concepts of each scene category. The typicality \u2026"

In this study we develop a hierarchical detection architecture for automobiles. The classifier operates by first locating keypoints in the test image with a well known interest operator. These keypoints are then compared against a corpus of car-specific keypoints learned from the training data. The resulting similarity vector is input into a Support Vector Machine for classification. We compare the performance of our classifier to that of well documented learning algorithms (SVMs and k-Nearest Neighbors) on two separate databases of still images of cars. Our results suggest that part-based detection architectures indeed work well for this class of objects."

The main difficulties are the large appearance variations caused by action, clothing, illumination, viewpoint and scale. Our goal is to find people in static video frames using learned models of both the appearance of body parts (head, limbs, hands), and of the geometry of their assemblies. We build on Forsyth & Fleck's general 'body plan' methodology and Felzenszwalb & Huttenlocher's dynamic programming approach for efficiently assembling candidate parts into 'pictorial structures'. However we replace the rather simple part detectors used in these works with dedicated detectors learned for each body part using SupportVector Machines (SVMs) or RelevanceVector Machines (RVMs). We are not aware of any previous work using SVMs to learn articulated body plans, however they have been used to detect both whole pedestrians and combinations of rigidly positioned subimages (typically, upper body, arms, and legs) in street scenes, under a wide range of illumination, pose and clothing variations. RVMs are SVM-like classifiers that offer a well-founded probabilistic interpretation and improved sparsity for reduced computation. We demonstrate their benefits experimentally in a series of results showing great promise for learning detectors in more general situations."

The method is based on local characteristics which are invariant to similarity transformations in the image. These characteristics are computed at automatically detected keypoints using the greyvalue signal. The method therefore works on images such as paintings for which geometry based recognition fails. Due to the locality of the method, images can be recognized being given part of an image and in the presence of occlusions. Applying a voting algorithm and semi-local constraints makes the method robust to noise, scene clutter and small perspective deformations. Experiments show an efficient recognition for different types of images. The approach has been validated on an image database containing 1020 images, some of them being very similar by structure, texture or shape."

Our work is motivated by the pictorial structure models introduced by Fischler and Elschlager. The basic idea is to represent an object by a collection of parts arranged in a deformable configuration. The appearance of each part is modeled separately, and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. These models allow for qualitative descriptions of visual appearance, and are suitable for generic recognition problems. We address the problem of using pictorial structure models to find instances of an object in an image as well as the problem of learning an object model from training examples, presenting efficient algorithms in both cases. We demonstrate the techniques by learning models that represent faces and human bodies and using the resulting models to locate the corresponding objects in novel images."

                "text": "Researchers have long sought to understand what the brain does when we see an object, what two people have in common when they see the same object, and what a \"seeing\" machine would need to have in common with a human visual system. Recent neurobiological and computational advances in the study of vision have now brought us close to answering these and other questions about representation. In Representation and Recognition in Vision, Shimon Edelman bases a comprehensive approach to visual representation on the notion of correspondence between proximal (internal) and distal similarities in objects. This leads to a computationally feasible and formally veridical representation of distal objects that addresses the needs of shape categorization and can be used to derive models of perceived similarity. Edelman first discusses the representational needs of various visual recognition tasks, and surveys current theories of representation in this context. He then develops a theory of representation that is related to Shepard's notion of second-order isomorphism between representations and their targets. Edelman goes beyond Shepard by specifying the conditions under which the representations can be made formally veridical. Edelman assesses his theory's performance in identification and categorization of 3D shapes and examines it in light of psychological and neurobiological data concerning the object-processing stream in primate vision. He also discusses the connections between his theory and other efforts to understand representation in the brain."

                "text": "The fact that objects in the world appear in different ways depending on the scale of observation has important implications if one aims at describing them. It shows that the notion of scale is of utmost importance when processing unknown measurement data by automatic methods. In their seminal works, Witkin (1983) and Koenderink (1984) proposed to approach this problem by representing image structures at different scales in a so-called scale-space representation. Traditional scale-space theory building on this work, however, does not address the problem of how to select local appropriate scales for further analysis. This article proposes a systematic methodology for dealing with this problem. A framework is presented for generating hypotheses about interesting scale levels in image data, based on a general principle stating that local extrema over scales of different combinations of \u03b3-normalized derivatives are likely candidates to correspond to interesting structures. Specifically, it is shown how this idea can be used as a major mechanism in algorithms for automatic scale selection, which adapt the local scales of processing to the local image structure.Support for the proposed approach is given in terms of a general theoretical investigation of the behaviour of the scale selection method under rescalings of the input pattern and by integration with different types of early visual modules, including experiments on real-world and synthetic data. Support is also given by a detailed analysis of how different types of feature detectors perform when integrated with a scale selection mechanism and then applied to characteristic model patterns. Specifically, it is described in detail how the proposed methodology applies to the problems of blob detection, junction detection, edge detection, ridge detection and local frequency estimation.In many computer vision applications, the poor performance of the low-level vision modules constitutes a major bottleneck. It is argued that the inclusion of mechanisms for automatic scale selection is essential if we are to construct vision systems to automatically analyse complex unknown environments."

                "text": "In this paper we describe the first stage of a new learning system for object detection and recognition. For our system we propose Boosting (5) as the underlying learning technique. This allows the use of very diverse sets of visual features in the learning process within a com- mon framework: Boosting \u2014 together with a weak hypotheses finder \u2014 may choose very inhomogeneous features as most relevant for combina- tion into a final hypothesis. As another advantage the weak hypotheses finder may search the weak hypotheses space without explicit calculation of all available hypotheses, reducing computation time. This contrasts the related work of Agarwal and Roth (1) where Winnow was used as learning algorithm and all weak hypotheses were calculated explicitly. In our first empirical evaluation we use four types of local descriptors: two basic ones consisting of a set of grayvalues and intensity moments and two high level descriptors: moment invariants (8) and SIFTs (12). The descriptors are calculated from local patches detected by an inter- est point operator. The weak hypotheses finder selects one of the local patches and one type of local descriptor and efficiently searches for the most discriminative similarity threshold. This differs from other work on Boosting for object recognition where simple rectangular hypotheses (22) or complex classifiers (20) have been used. In relatively simple images, where the objects are prominent, our approach yields results comparable to the state-of-the-art (3). But we also obtain very good results on more complex images, where the objects are located in arbitrary positions, poses, and scales in the images. These results indicate that our flexible approach, which also allows the inclusion of features from segmented re- gions and even spatial relationships, leads us a significant step towards generic object recognition."

Such regions are then described by a set of invariant features, which makes it relatively easy to match them between views and under changing illumination. In previous work, we have presented invariant regions that are based on a combination of corners and edges. The application discussed then was image database retrieval. Here, an alternative method for extracting (affinely) invariant regions is given, that does not depend on the presence of edges or corners in the image but is purely intensity-based. Also, we demonstrate the use of such regions for another application, which is wide baseline stereo matching. As a matter of fact, the goal is to build an opportunistic system that exploits several types of invariant regions as it sees fit. This yields more correspondences and a system that can deal with a wider range of images. To increase the robustness of the system even further, two semi-local constraints on combinations of region correspondences are derived (one geometric, the other photometric). They allow to test the consistency of correspondences and hence to reject falsely matched regions."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

                "text": "The problem of automatically learning object models for recognition and pose estimation is addressed. In contrast to the traditional approach, the recognition problem is formulated as one of matching appearance rather than shape. The appearance of an object in a two-dimensional image depends on its shape, reflectance properties, pose in the scene, and the illumination conditions. While shape and reflectance are intrinsic properties and constant for a rigid object, pose and illumination vary from scene to scene. A compact representation of object appearance is proposed that is parametrized by pose and illumination. For each object of interest, a large set of images is obtained by automatically varying pose and illumination. This image set is compressed to obtain a low-dimensional subspace, called the eigenspace, in which the object is represented as a manifold. Given an unknown input image, the recognition system projects the image to eigenspace. The object is recognized based on the manifold it lies on. The exact position of the projection on the manifold determines the object's pose in the image.A variety of experiments are conducted using objects with complex appearance characteristics. The performance of the recognition and pose estimation algorithms is studied using over a thousand input images of sample objects. Sensitivity of recognition to the number of eigenspace dimensions and the number of learning samples is analyzed. For the objects used, appearance representation in eigenspaces with less than 20 dimensions produces accurate recognition results with an average pose estimation error of about 1.0 degree. A near real-time recognition system with 20 complex objects in the database has been developed. The paper is concluded with a discussion on various issues related to the proposed learning and recognition methodology."

We present a new cue integration scheme, which extends the idea of cue accumulation to discriminative classifiers. We derive and test the scheme for support vector machines (SVMs), but we also show that it is easily extendible to any large margin classifier. In the case of one-class SVMs the scheme can be interpreted as a new class of Mercer kernels for multiple cues. Experimental comparison with a probabilistic accumulation scheme is favorable to our method. Comparison with voting scheme shows that our method may suffer as the number of object classes increases. Based on these results, we propose a recognition algorithm consisting of a decision tree where decisions at each node are taken using our accumulation scheme. Results obtained using this new algorithm compare very favorably to accumulation (both probabilistic and discriminative) and voting scheme."

This process provides accurate delineation of object boundaries that cannot be achieved by either the top-down or bottom-up approach alone. The top-down approach uses object representation learned from examples to detect an object in a given input image and provide an approximation to its figure-ground segmentation. The bottom-up approach uses image-based criteria to define coherent groups of pixels that are likely to belong together to either the figure or the background part. The combination provides a final segmentation that draws on the relative merits of both approaches: The result is as close as possible to the top-down approximation, but is also constrained by the bottom-up process to be consistent with significant image discontinuities. We construct a global cost function that represents these top-down and bottom-up requirements. We then show how the global minimum of this function can be efficiently found by applying the sum-product algorithm. This algorithm also provides a confidence map that can be used to identify image regions where additional top-down or bottom-up information may further improve the segmentation. Our experiments show that the results derived from the algorithm are superior to results given by a pure top-down or pure bottom-up approach. The scheme has broad applicability, enabling the combined use of a range of existing bottom-up and top-down segmentations."

Such a method also incorporates a unique feature representation. The early stages in the cascade use simple fast feature evaluations and the later stages use more complex discriminative features. In particular, we propose features based on sparse coding and ordinal relationships among filter responses. This combination of cascaded feature-centric evaluation with features of increasing complexity achieves both computational efficiency and accuracy.

The proposed method, based on matching of local image features, reliably recognises objects under very different viewing conditions. First, distinguished regions of data-dependent shape are robustly detected. On these regions, local affine frames are established using several affine invariant constructions. Direct comparison of photometrically normalised colour intensities in local, geometrically aligned frames results in a matching scheme that is invariant to piecewise-affine image deformations, but still remains very discriminative. The potential of the approach is experimentally verified on COIL-100 and SOIL-47 \u2010 publicly available image databases. On SOIL-47, 100% recognition rate is achieved for single training view per object. On COIL-100, 99.9% recognition rate is obtained for 18 training views per object. Robustness to severe occlusions is demonstrated by only a moderate decrease of recognition performance in an experiment where half of each test image is erased."

We present a method for learning object categories from just a few images (1 /spl sim/ 5). It is based on incorporating \"generic\" knowledge which may be obtained from previously learnt models of unrelated categories. We operate in a variational Bayesian framework: object categories are represented by probabilistic models, and \"prior\" knowledge is represented as a probability density function on the parameters of these models. The \"posterior\" model for an object category is obtained by updating the prior in the light of one or more observations. Our ideas are demonstrated on four diverse categories (human faces, airplanes, motorcycles, spotted cats). Initially three categories are learnt from hundreds of training examples, and a \"prior\" is estimated from these. Then the model of the fourth category is learnt from 1 to 5 training examples, and is used for detecting new exemplars a set of test images."

This paradigm enables a unified approach to rigid object recognition under different viewing transformation assumptions both for 2-D and 3-D objects obtained by different sensors, e.g. vision, range, tactile. It is based on an intensive off-line model preprocessing (learning) stage, where model information is indexed into a hash-table using minimal, transformation invariant features. This enables the on-line recognition algorithm to be particularly efficient. The algorithm is straightforwardly parallelizable. Initial experimentation of the technique has led to successful recognition of both 2-D and 3-D objects in cluttered scenes from an arbitrary viewpoint. We, also, compare the Geometric Hashing with the Hough Transform and the alignment techniques. Extensions of the basic paradigm which reduce its worst case recognition complexity are discussed."

This assumption seems logically necessary: How can object recognition occur before a region is labeled as figure? However, some behavioral studies find that familiar regions are more likely to be labeled figure than less familiar regions, a problematic finding for bottom-up models. An interactive account is proposed in which figure-ground processes receive top-down input from object representations in a hierarchical system. A graded, interactive computational model is presented that accounts for behavioral results in which familiarity effects are found. The interactive model offers an alternative conception of visual processing to bottom-up models."

The regions are used in a similar way to the local interest points extracted from gray-level images, but they capture shape rather than texture. Local convexity is characterized by measuring the extent to which the detected image contours support circle or arc-like local structures at each position and scale in the image. Our saliency measure combines two cost functions defined on the tangential edges near the circle: a tangential-gradient energy term, and an entropy term that ensures local support from a wide range of angular positions around the circle. The detected regions are invariant to scale changes and rotations, and robust against clutter, occlusions and spurious edge detections. Experimental results show very good performance for both shape matching and recognition of object categories."

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds."

There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \u201cIntegral Image\u201d which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a simple and efficient classifier which is built using the AdaBoost learning algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1995) to select a small number of critical visual features from a very large set of potential features. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a \u201ccascade\u201d which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising face-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection is presented. The system yields face detection performance comparable to the best previous systems (Sung and Poggio, 1998; Rowley et al., 1998; Schneiderman and Kanade, 2000; Roth et al., 2000). Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second."

The resulting clusters, referred to as \"classtons\", identify the significant class characteristics from a small set of sample images. The classton channels mark these characteristics reliably using a probabilistic cluster representation. The classtons demonstrate good generalisation with respect to viewpoint changes and previously unseen objects. In all experiments, the classton channels of similar images have the same spatial relations. Learning of these relations allows to generate a classification model that combines the generalisation ability from the classtons and the discriminative power from the spatial relations."

                "text": "We consider learning models for object recognition from examples. Our method is motivated by systems that use the Hausdorff distance as a shape comparison measure. Typically an object is represented in terms of a model shape. A new shape is classified as being an instance of the object when the Hausdorff distance between the model and the new shape is small. We show that such object concepts can be seen as halfspaces (linear threshold functions) in a transformed input space. This makes it possible to use a number of standard algorithms to learn object models from training examples. When a good model exists, we are guaranteed to find one that provides (with high probability) a recognition rule that is accurate. Our approach provides a measure which generalizes the Hausdorff distance in a number of interesting ways. To demonstrate our method we trained a system to detect people in images using a single shape model. The learning techniques can be extended to represent objects using multiple model shapes. In this way, we might be able to automatically learn a small set of canonical shapes that characterize the appearance of an object."

In this paper we present a new paradigm for the segmentation of range images into piecewise continuous surfaces. Data aggregation is performed via model recovery in terms of variable-order bi-variate polynomials using iterative regression. Model recovery is initiated independently in regularly placed seed regions in the image. All the recovered models are potential candidates for the final description of the data. Selection of the models is defined as a quadratic Boolean problem, and the solution is sought by the WTA (winner-takes-all) technique, which turns out to be a good compromise between the speed of computation and the accuracy of the solution. The overall efficiency of the method is achieved by combining model recovery and model selection in an iterative way. Partial recovery of the models is followed by the selection (optimization) procedure and only the \u201cbest\u201d models are allowed to develop further.The major novelty of the approach lies in an effective combination of simple component algorithms, which stands in contrast to methods which attempt to solve the problem in a single processing step using sophisticated means. We present the results on several real range images."

Given a set of images of objects from a given class under different viewing conditions, the algorithm identifies corresponding regions depicting the same object part in different images. The technique is based on using the equivalence of corresponding features in different viewing conditions. This equivalence-based matching scheme is not restricted to planar components or affine transformations. As a result, it identifies corresponding parts more accurately and under more general conditions than previous methods. The scheme is general and works for a variety of natural object classes. We demonstrate that using the proposed methods, a dense set of accurate correspondences can be obtained. Experimental comparisons to several known techniques are presented. An application to the problem of invariant object recognition is shown, and additional applications to wide-baseline stereo are discussed."

We then compared the part verification response times for various probe/target combinations before and after the exposure. For composite probes, the speedup was much larger for targets that contained pairs of fragments perfectly predictive of each other, compared to those that did not. This effect was modulated by the significance of their co-occurrence as estimated by Barlow's criterion. For lone-fragment probes, the speedup in all conditions was generally lower than for composites. These results shed light on the brain's strategies for unsupervised acquisition of structural information in vision."

A cousin of the optimal detector is developed which uses \u201csoft\u201d part detectors with a probabilistic description of the spatial arrangement of the parts. Spatial arrangements are modeled probabilistically using shape statistics to achieve invariance to translation, rotation, and scaling. Improved recognition performance over methods based on \u201chard\u201d part detectors is demonstrated for the problem of face detection in cluttered scenes."

In contrast in the case of widely separated views, methods have generally been restricted to two or three views.In this paper we investigate the problem of establishing relative viewpoints given a large number of images where no ordering information is provided. A typical application would be where images are obtained from different sources or at different times: both the viewpoint (position, orientation, scale) and lighting conditions may vary significantly over the data set.Such a problem is not fundamentally amenable to exhaustive pair wise and triplet wide baseline matching because this would be prohibitively expensive as the number of views increases. Instead, we investiate how a combination of image invariants, covariants, and multiple view relations can be used in concord to enable efficient multiple view matching. The result is a matching algorithm which is linear in the number of views.The methods are illustrated on several real image data sets. The output enables an image based technique for navigating in a 3D scene, moving from one image to whichever image is the next most appropriate."

We investigate two aspects of the problem: the scale of the configurations, and the similarity requirements for clustering configurations. The problem is challenging firstly because an object can undergo substantial changes in imaged appearance throughout a video (due to viewpoint and illumination change, and partial occlusion), and secondly because configurations are detected imperfectly, so that inexact patterns must be matched. The novelty of the method is that viewpoint invariant features are used to form the configurations, and that efficient methods from the text analysis literature are employed to reduce the matching complexity. Examples of 'mined' objects are shown for a feature length film and a sitcom."

The first stages use simple local features, and the image is subsequently represented in terms of larger and more complex features. These include features of intermediate complexity and partial object views. The nature and use of these higher-order representations remains an open question in the study of visual processing by the primate cortex. Here we show that intermediate complexity (IC) features are optimal for the basic visual task of classification. Moderately complex features are more informative for classification than very simple or very complex ones, and so they emerge naturally by the simple coding principle of information maximization with respect to a class of images. Our findings suggest a specific role for IC features in visual processing and a principle for their extraction."

We represent global context information in terms of the spatial layout of spectral components. The resulting scheme serves as an effective procedure for context driven focus of attention and scale-selection on real-world scenes. Based on a simple holistic analysis of an image, the scheme is able to accurately predict object locations and sizes."

A classifier is then learned for each of these parts, and feature selection is used to determine the most discriminative ones. This approach allows robust pan detection, and it is invariant under scale changes-that is, neither the training images nor the test images have to be normalized. The proposed method is evaluated in car detection tasks with significant variations in viewing conditions, and promising results are demonstrated. Different local regions, classifiers and feature selection methods are quantitatively compared. Our evaluation shows that local invariant descriptors are an appropriate representation for object classes such as cars, and it underlines the importance of feature selection."

Traditional approaches require applying a battery of different classifiers to the image, which can be slow and require much training data. We present a multi-class boosting procedure (joint boosting) that reduces both the computational and sample complexity, by finding common features that can be shared across the classes. The detectors for each class are trained jointly, rather than independently. For a given performance level, the total number of features required is observed to scale approximately logarithmically with the number of classes. In addition, we find that the features selected by independently trained classifiers are often specific to the class, whereas the features selected by the jointly trained classifiers are more generic features, such as lines and edges."

Recent work has shown that scale-space `interest points' may be found with good repeatability in spite of such changes. Further- more, the high entropy of the surrounding image regions means that local descriptors are highly discriminative for matching. For descrip- tors at interest points to be robustly matched between images, they must be as far as possible invariant to the imaging process. In this work we introduce a family of features which use groups of interest points to form geometrically invariant descriptors of image regions. Feature descriptors are formed by resampling the image rel- ative to canonical frames de\u00afned by the points. In addition to robust matching, a key advantage of this approach is that each match implies a hypothesis of the local 2D (projective) transformation. This allows us to immediately reject most of the false matches using a Hough trans- form. We reject remaining outliers using RANSAC and the epipolar constraint. Results show that dense feature matching can be achieved in a few seconds of computation on 1GHz Pentium III machines."

The second algorithm uses a part-based representation that relies on local properties of the data. The strengths of the two detection algorithms are then combined to form a more powerful detector The approach is evaluated on a database of real-world images containing side views of cars. The combined detector gives distinctly superior performance than each of the individual detectors, achieving a high detection accuracy of 94% on this difficult test set."

Prior research (A. Needham & R. Baillargeon, 1998) showed that when infants see an object alone and then see it next to a novel object, this prior experience allows them to determine the location of a boundary between the two objects. The present experiments investigated whether infants would also use an object similar, but not identical, to a test object in the same kind of task. The results indicate that infants' use of a prior experience is disrupted by changes in the features of the object, but not by a change in its spatial orientation. These findings suggest that, like adults, infants may expect that changes in the features of an object are associated with a change in the identity of the object, but do not have the same expectation for changes in spatial orientation."

An object is represented by a set of high-dimensional iconic feature vectors comprised of the responses of derivatives of Gaussian filters at a range of orientations and scales. Since these filters can be shown to form the eigenvectors of arbitrary images containing both natural and man-made structures, they are well-suited for indexing in disparate domains. The indexing algorithm uses an active vision system in conjunction with a modified form of Kanerva's (1988, 1993) sparse distributed memory which facilitates interpolation between views and provides a convenient platform for learning the association between an object's appearance and its identity. The robustness of the indexing method was experimentally confirmed by subjecting the method to a range of viewing conditions and the accuracy was verified using a well-known model database containing a number of complex 3D objects under varying pose.<<ETX>>"

Humans are modeled as flexible assemblies of parts, and robust part detection is the key to the approach. The parts are represented by co-occurrences of local features which captures the spatial layout of the partrsquos appearance. Feature selection and the part detectors are learnt from training images using AdaBoost. The detection algorithm is very efficient as (i) all part detectors use the same initial features, (ii) a coarse-to-fine cascade approach is used for part detection, (iii) a part assembly strategy reduces the number of spurious detections and the search space. The results outperform existing human detectors."

Although a number of approaches have been proposed for shock graph matching, these approaches do not address the equally important indexing problem. We extend our previous work in both shock graph matching and hierarchical structure indexing to propose the first unified framework for view-based 3-D object recognition using shock graphs. The heart of the framework is an improved spectral characterization of shock graph structure that not only drives a powerful indexing mechanism (to retrieve similar candidates from a large database), but also drives a matching algorithm that can accommodate noise and occlusion. We describe the components of our system and evaluate its performance using both unoccluded and occluded queries. The large set of recognition trials (over 25,000) from a large database (over 1400 views) represents one of the most ambitious shock graph-based recognition experiments conducted to date."

In fact, the structure of many real-world scenes is governed by strong configurational rules akin to those that apply to a single object. Here we introduce a simple framework for modeling the relationship between context and object properties based on the correlation between the statistics of low-level features across the entire scene and the objects that it contains. The resulting scheme serves as an effective procedure for object priming, context driven focus of attention and automatic scale-selection on real-world scenes."

The computational approach taken in this system is motivated by both physiology and information theory, as well as by the practical requirements of near-real-time performance and accuracy. Our approach treats the face recognition problem as an intrinsically two-dimensional (2-D) recognition problem rather than requiring recovery of three-dimensional geometry, taking advantage of the fact that faces are normally upright and thus may be described by a small set of 2-D characteristic views. The system functions by projecting face images onto a feature space that spans the significant variations among known face images. The significant features are known as \"eigenfaces,\" because they are the eigenvectors (principal components) of the set of faces; they do not necessarily correspond to features such as eyes, ears, and noses. The projection operation characterizes an individual face by a weighted sum of the eigenface features, and so to recognize a particular face it is necessary only to compare these weights to those of known individuals. Some particular advantages of our approach are that it provides for the ability to learn and later recognize new faces in an unsupervised manner, and that it is easy to implement using a neural network architecture."

The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. The result is that retrieved is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of Google. The method is illustrated for matching in two full length feature films."

Many different descriptors have been proposed in the literature. It is unclear which descriptors are more appropriate and how their performance depends on the interest region detector. The descriptors should be distinctive and at the same time robust to changes in viewing conditions as well as to errors of the detector. Our evaluation uses as criterion recall with respect to precision and is carried out for different image transformations. We compare shape context [Belongie, S, et al., April 2002], steerable filters [Freeman, W and Adelson, E, Setp. 1991], PCA-SIFT [Ke, Y and Sukthankar, R, 2004], differential invariants [Koenderink, J and van Doorn, A, 1987], spin images [Lazebnik, S, et al., 2003], SIFT [Lowe, D. G., 1999], complex filters [Schaffalitzky, F and Zisserman, A, 2002], moment invariants [Van Gool, L, et al., 1996], and cross-correlation for different types of interest regions. We also propose an extension of the SIFT descriptor and show that it outperforms the original method. Furthermore, we observe that the ranking of the descriptors is mostly independent of the interest region detector and that the SIFT-based descriptors perform best. Moments and steerable filters show the best performance among the low dimensional descriptors."

Their performance depends critically on the accuracy and reliability with which corresponding keypoints can be found in subsequent images. Among the many existing keypoint selection criteria, the popular Forstner-Harris approach explicitly targets geometric stability, defining keypoints to be points that have locally maximal self-matching precision under translational least squares template matching. However, many applications require stability in orientation and scale as well as in position. Detecting translational key- points and verifying orientation/scale behaviour post hoc is suboptimal, and can be misleading when different motion variables interact. We give a more principled formulation, based on extending the Forstner-Harris approach to general motion models and robust template matching. We also incorporate a simple local appear- ance model to ensure good resistance to the most common illumination variations. We illustrate the resulting methods and quantify their performance on test images."

The method uses a template hierarchy to capture the variety of object shapes; efficient hierarchies can be generated offline for given shape distributions using stochastic optimization techniques (i.e. simulated annealing). Online, matching involves a simultaneous coarse-to-fine approach over the shape hierarchy and over the transformation parameters. Very large speed-up factors are typically obtained when comparing this approach with the equivalent brute-force formulation; we have measured gains of several orders of magnitudes. We present experimental results on the real-time detection of traffic signs and pedestrians from a moving vehicle. Because of the highly time sensitive nature of these vision tasks, we also discuss some hardware-specific implementations of the proposed method as far as SIMD parallelism is concerned."

The numerous approaches to this problem differ in the type of background model used and the procedure used to update the model. This paper discusses modeling each pixel as a mixture of Gaussians and using an on-line approximation to update the model. The Gaussian, distributions of the adaptive mixture model are then evaluated to determine which are most likely to result from a background process. Each pixel is classified based on whether the Gaussian distribution which represents it most effectively is considered part of the background model. This results in a stable, real-time outdoor tracker which reliably deals with lighting changes, repetitive motions from clutter, and long-term scene changes. This system has been run almost continuously for 16 months, 24 hours a day, through rain and snow."

The object class models are ``learned'''' from example images that we call prototypes. In addition to the images, the pixelwise correspondences between a reference prototype and each of the other prototypes must also be provided. Thus a model consists of a linear combination of prototypical shapes and textures. A stochastic gradient descent algorithm is used to match a model to a novel image by minimizing the error between the model and the novel image. Example models are shown as well as example matches to novel images. The robustness of the matching algorithm is also evaluated. The technique can be used for a number of applications including the computation of correspondence between novel images of a certain known class, object recognition, image synthesis and image compression."

Complexity level analysis may resolve this contradiction. Visual search can be reshaped into tractability through approximations and by optimizing the resources devoted to visual processing. Architectural constraints can be derived using the minimum cost principle to rule out a large class of potential solutions. The evidence speaks strongly against bottom-up approaches to vision. In particular, the constraints suggest an attentional mechanism that exploits knowledge of the specific problem being solved. This analysis of visual search performance in terms of attentional influences on visual information processing and complexity satisfaction allows a large body of neurophysiological and psychological evidence to be tied together."

A new set of image elements that are put into correspondence, the so called extremal regions, is introduced. Extremal regions possess highly desirable properties: the set is closed under 1. continuous (and thus projective) transformation of image coordinates and 2. monotonic transformation of image intensities. An efficient (near linear complexity) and practically fast detection algorithm (near frame rate) is presented for an affinely-invariant stable subset of extremal regions, the maximally stable extremal regions (MSER). A new robust similarity measure for establishing tentative correspondences is proposed. The robustness ensures that invariants from multiple measurement regions (regions obtained by invariant constructions from extremal regions), some that are significantly larger (and hence discriminative) than the MSERs, may be used to establish tentative correspondences. The high utility of MSERs, multiple measurement regions and the robust metric is demonstrated in wide-baseline experiments on image pairs from both indoor and outdoor scenes. Significant change of scale (3.5\u00d7), illumination conditions, out-of-plane rotation, occlusion , locally anisotropic scale change and 3D translation of the viewpoint are all present in the test problems. Good estimates of epipolar geometry (average distance from corresponding points to the epipolar line below 0.09 of the inter-pixel distance) are obtained."

The basic computational module of the technique is an old pattern recognition procedure: the mean shift. For discrete data, we prove the convergence of a recursive mean shift procedure to the nearest stationary point of the underlying density function and, thus, its utility in detecting the modes of the density. The relation of the mean shift procedure to the Nadaraya-Watson estimator from kernel regression and the robust M-estimators; of location is also established. Algorithms for two low-level vision tasks discontinuity-preserving smoothing and image segmentation - are described as applications. In these algorithms, the only user-set parameter is the resolution of the analysis, and either gray-level or color images are accepted as input. Extensive experimental results illustrate their excellent performance."

In this paper we introduce and empirically analysis two extensions to their approach: Firstly, a novel set of rotated haar-like features is introduced. These novel features significantly enrich the simple features of [6] and can also be calculated efficiently. With these new rotated features our sample face detector shows off on average a 10% lower false alarm rate at a given hit rate. Secondly, we present a through analysis of different boosting algorithms (namely Discrete, Real and Gentle Adaboost) and weak classifiers on the detection performance and computational complexity. We will see that Gentle Adaboost with small CART trees as base classifiers outperform Discrete Adaboost and stumps. The complete object detection training and detection system as well as a trained face detector are available in the Open Computer Vision Library at sourceforge.net [8]."

Natural images contain both textured and untextured regions, so the cues of contour and texture differences are exploited simultaneously. Contours are treated in the intervening contour framework, while texture is analyzed using textons. Each of these cues has a domain of applicability, so to facilitate cue combination we introduce a gating operator based on the texturedness of the neighborhood at a pixel. Having obtained a local measure of how likely two nearby pixels are to belong to the same region, we use the spectral graph theoretic framework of normalized cuts to find partitions of the image into regions of coherent texture and brightness. Experimental results on a wide range of images are shown."

The representation is an organized collection of grouping hints obtained from a combination of constraints on color and texture and constraints on geometric properties such as the structure of individual parts and the relationships between parts. Body plans can be learned from image data, using established statistical learning techniques. The approach is illustrated with two examples of programs that successfully use body plans for recognition: one example involves determining whether a picture contains a scantily clad human, using a body plan built by hand; the other involves determining whether a picture contains a horse, using a body plan learned from image data. In both cases, the system demonstrates excellent performance on large, uncontrolled test sets and very large and diverse control sets."

We use a detection style algorithm that scans a detector over two consecutive frames of a video sequence. The detector is trained (using AdaBoost) to take advantage of both motion and appearance information to detect a walking person. Past approaches have built detectors based on motion information or detectors based on appearance information, but ours is the first to combine both sources of information in a single detector. The implementation described runs at about 4 frames/second, detects pedestrians at very small scales (as small as 20 \u00d7 15 pixels), and has a very low false positive rate.Our approach builds on the detection work of Viola and Jones. Novel contributions of this paper include: (i) development of a representation of image motion which is extremely efficient, and (ii) implementation of a state of the art pedestrian detection system which operates on low resolution images under difficult conditions (such as rain and snow)."

The results demonstrate the superiority of informative class-specific features, as compared with generic type features such as wavelets, for the task of object recognition. We show that information rich features can reach optimal performance with simple linear separation rules, while generic feature based classifiers require more complex classification schemes. This is significant because efficient and optimal methods have been developed for spaces that allow linear separation. To compare different strategies for feature extraction, we trained and compared classifiers working in feature spaces of the same low dimensionality, using two feature types (image fragments vs. wavelets) and two classification rules (linear hyperplane and a Bayesian network). The results show that by maximizing the individual information of the features, it is possible to obtain efficient classification by a simple linear separating rule, as well as more efficient learning."

Our algorithm uses modern numeric techniques to find an approximate solution to normalized cut measures in time that is linear in the size of the image with only a few dozen operations per pixel. In just one pass the algorithm provides a complete hierarchical decomposition of the image into segments. The algorithm detects the segments by applying a process of recursive coarsening in which the same minimization problem is represented with fewer and fewer variables producing an irregular pyramid. During this coarsening process we may compute additional internal statistics of the emerging segments and use these statistics to facilitate the segmentation process. Once the pyramid is completed it is scanned from the top down to associate pixels close to the boundaries of segments with the appropriate segment. The algorithm is inspired by algebraic multigrid (AMG) solvers of minimization problems of heat or electric networks. We demonstrate the algorithm by applying it to real images."

The system consists of a two-level hierarchy of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. On the first level, component classifiers independently detect components Of a face. On the second level, a single classifier checks if the geometrical configuration of the detected components in the image matches a geometrical model of a face. We propose a method for automatically learning components by using 3-D head models, This approach has the advantage that no manual interaction is required for choosing and extracting components. Experiments show that the component-based system is significantly more robust against rotations in depth than a comparable system trained on whole face patterns."

In the first step, contour features are used in a hierarchical template matching approach to efficiently \"lock\" onto candidate solutions. Shape matching is based on Distance Transforms. By capturing the objects shape variability by means of a template hierarchy and using a combined coarse-to-fine approach in shape and parameter space, this method achieves very large speed-ups compared to a brute-force method. We have measured gains of several orders of magnitude. The second step utilizes the richer set of intensity features in a pattern classification approach to verify the candidate solutions (i.e. using Radial Basis Functions). We present experimental results on pedestrian detection off-line and on-board our Urban Traffic Assistant vehicle and discuss the challenges that lie ahead."

In our framework, the measurement of similarity is preceded by (1) solving for correspondences between points on the two shapes, (2) using the correspondences to estimate an aligning transform. In order to solve the correspondence problem, we attach a descriptor, the shape context, to each point. The shape context at a reference point captures the distribution of the remaining points relative to it, thus offering a globally discriminative characterization. Corresponding points on two similar shapes will have similar shape contexts, enabling us to solve for correspondences as an optimal assignment problem. Given the point correspondences, we estimate the transformation that best aligns the two shapes; regularized thin-plate splines provide a flexible class of transformation maps for this purpose. Dis-similarity between two shapes is computed as a sum of matching errors between corresponding points, together with a term measuring the magnitude of the aligning transform. We treat recognition in a nearest-neighbor classification framework. Results are presented for silhouettes, trademarks, handwritten digits and the COIL dataset."

In this extended abstract, we invoke philosophical observations, computational arguments, behavioral data and neurobiological findings to explain why computer vision researchers should care about (1) unsupervised learning, (2) statistical inference, and (3) the visual brain. We then outline a neuromorphic approach to structural primitive learning motivated by these considerations, survey a range of neurobiological findings and behavioral data consistent with it, and conclude by mentioning some of the more challenging directions for future research. 1 Why computer vision should care about unsupervised learning As the goals of computer vision grow more ambitious, the importance of learning becomes more difficult to deny: nobody wants to have to enter object and scene representations into his or her system by hand. But why should we insist that such learning be, in the first instance, unsupervised? Because we should not trust our analytical intuitions about the ontology of visual objects.Although the increasing availability of annotated image databases encourages the development of highly sophisticated supervised learning methods that combine linguistic and visual information (Duygulu et al., 2002), the success of such methods is limited by the poverty of the annotations, usually lexical labels. Indeed, a label (such as{cat, forest, grass, tiger }, shown in the work just cited) attached to a picture is both ontologically deficient in that it leaves out a host of possible complementary or alternative labels (Akins, 1996; Smith, 2001), and descriptively deficient in that it falls far short of providing a listener with a clear notion of the scene depicted (Kitcher and Varzi, 2000; Edelman, 2002). Thus, language conceived as a source of supervision for visual learning introduces biases that at best may be irrelevant, and at worst pernicious for any attempt to understand visual perception of objects and scenes. It would be prudent therefore to distrust \u2217This is an extended abstract of a manuscript in preparation.

We call this model a multidimensional morphable model or just a, morphable model. The morphable model is learned from example images (called prototypes) of objects of a class. In this paper we introduce an effective stochastic gradient descent algorithm that automaticaIly matches a model to a novel image by finding the parameters that minimize the error between the image generated by the model and the novel image. Two examples demonstrate the robustness and the broad range of applicability of the matching algorithm and the underlying morphable model. Our approach can provide novel solutions to several vision tasks, including the computation of image correspondence, object verification, image synthesis and image compression."

Large-scale recognition results are presented on three different databases, which demonstrate that SVMs with the proposed kernel perform better than standard matching techniques on local features. In addition, experiments on noisy and occluded images show that local feature representations significantly outperform global approaches."

The traditional approach to recognition and 3D reconstruction of human activity has been to track motion in 3D, mainly using advanced geometric and dynamic models. In this paper we reverse this process. View based activity recognition serves as an input to a human body location tracker with the ultimate goal of 3D reanimation in mind. We demonstrate that specific human actions can be detected from single frame postures in a video sequence. By recognizing the image of a person's posture as corresponding to a particular key frame from a set of stored key frames, it is possible to map body locations from the key frames to actual frames. This is achieved using a shape matching algorithm based on qualitative similarity that computes point to point correspondence between shapes, together with information about appearance. As the mapping is from fixed key frames, our tracking does not suffer from the problem of having to reinitialise when it gets lost. It is effectively a closed loop. We present experimental results both for recognition and tracking for a sequence of a tennis player."

The matching is under translation, but it can cover more general transformations by generating the various transformed templates explicitly. The novel part of the algorithm is that, in addition to a coarse-to-fine search over the translation parameters, the N templates are grouped off-line into a template hierarchy based on their similarity. This way, multiple templates can be matched simultaneously at the coarse levels of the search, resulting in various speed-up factors. Furthermore, in matching, features are distinguished by type and separate DTs are computed for each type (e.g. based on edge orientations). These concepts are illustrated in the application of traffic sign detection."

For example, constructing the category of \u201cthings to sell at a garage sale\u201d can be instrumental to achieving the goal of selling unwanted possessions. These categories differ from common categories (e.g., \u201cfruit,\u201d \u201cfurniture\u201d) in that ad hoc categories violate the correlational structure of the environment and are not well established in memory. Regarding the latter property, the category concepts, concept-to-instance associations, and instance-to-concept associations structuring ad hoc categories are shown to be much less established in memory than those of common categories. Regardless of these differences, however, ad hoc categories possess graded structures (i.e., typicality gradients) as salient as those structuring common categories. This appears to be the result of a similarity comparison process that imposes graded structure on any category regardless of type."

                "text": "The main purpose of this paper is to describe a process for partitioning an N-dimensional population into k sets on the basis of a sample. The process, which is called 'k-means,' appears to give partitions which are reasonably efficient in the sense of within-class variance. That is, if p is the probability mass function for the population, S = {S1, S2, * *, Sk} is a partition of EN, and ui, i = 1, 2, * , k, is the conditional mean of p over the set Si, then W2(S) = ff=ISi f z u42 dp(z) tends to be low for the partitions S generated by the method. We say 'tends to be low,' primarily because of intuitive considerations, corroborated to some extent by mathematical analysis and practical computational experience. Also, the k-means procedure is easily programmed and is computationally economical, so that it is feasible to process very large samples on a digital computer. Possible applications include methods for similarity grouping, nonlinear prediction, approximating multivariate distributions, and nonparametric tests for independence among several variables. In addition to suggesting practical classification methods, the study of k-means has proved to be theoretically interesting. The k-means concept represents a generalization of the ordinary sample mean, and one is naturally led to study the pertinent asymptotic behavior, the object being to establish some sort of law of large numbers for the k-means. This problem is sufficiently interesting, in fact, for us to devote a good portion of this paper to it. The k-means are defined in section 2.1, and the main results which have been obtained on the asymptotic behavior are given there. The rest of section 2 is devoted to the proofs of these results. Section 3 describes several specific possible applications, and reports some preliminary results from computer experiments conducted to explore the possibilities inherent in the k-means idea. The extension to general metric spaces is indicated briefly in section 4. The original point of departure for the work described here was a series of problems in optimal classification (MacQueen [9]) which represented special"

Unfortunately, the complexity of most existing search algorithms, such as k-d tree and R-tree, grows exponentially with dimension, making them impractical for dimensionality above 15. In nearly all applications, the closest point is of interest only if it lies within a user-specified distance /spl epsiv/. We present a simple and practical algorithm to efficiently search for the nearest neighbor within Euclidean distance /spl epsiv/. The use of projection search combined with a novel data structure dramatically improves performance in high dimensions. A complexity analysis is presented which helps to automatically determine /spl epsiv/ in structured problems. A comprehensive set of benchmarks clearly shows the superiority of the proposed algorithm for a variety of structured and unstructured search problems. Object recognition is demonstrated as an example application. The simplicity of the algorithm makes it possible to construct an inexpensive hardware search engine which can be 100 times faster than its software equivalent. A C++ implementation of our algorithm is available."

Due to the availability of more accurate 3D range imaging equipment, evaluation of existing algorithms for the extraction of these invariants and other useful features from discrete 3D data, is now relevant. The work makes subtle but very important modifications to two such algorithms, originally suggested by Taubin (1995) and Chen and Schmitt (1992). The algorithms have been adjusted to deal with real discrete noisy range data. The results of this implementation were evaluated in a series of tests on synthetic and real input yielding reliable estimations. Our conclusion is that with current scanning technology and the algorithms presented, reliable estimates of the principal curvatures and the Darboux frame can be extracted from real data and used in a variety of more comprehensive tasks."

We address this problem with mixtures of trees, and demonstrate an efficient and compact representation of this mixture, which admits simple learning and inference algorithms. We use this method to build an automated tracker for Muybridge sequences of a variety of human activities. Tracking is difficult, because the temporal dependencies rule out simple inference methods. We show how to use our model for efficient inference, using a method that employs alternate spatial and temporal inference. The result is a cracker that (a) uses a very loose motion model, and so can track many different activities at a variable frame rate and (b) is entirely, automatic."

In this article, we present initial results that demonstrate that similar ideas can be developed for the recognition and synthesis of complex motion patterns. We present a technique that permits to represent complex motion or action patterns by linear combinations of a small number of prototypical image sequences. We demonstrate the applicability of this new approach for the synthesis and analysis of biological motion using simulated and real video data from different locomotion patterns. Our results show that complex motion patterns are embedded in pattern spaces with a defined topological structure, which can be uncovered with our methods. The underlying pattern space seems to have locally, but not globally, the properties of a linear vector space. We show how the knowledge about the topology of the pattern space can be exploited during pattern recognition. Our method may provide a new interesting approach for the analysis and synthesis of video sequences and complex movements."

The method is based on two recent results on scale space: (1) Interest points can be adapted to scale and give repeatable results (geometrically stable). (2) Local extrema over scale of normalized derivatives indicate the presence of characteristic local structures. Our method first computes a multi-scale representation for the Harris interest point detector. We then select points at which a local measure (the Laplacian) is maximal over scales. This allows a selection of distinctive points for which the characteristic scale is known. These points are invariant to scale, rotation and translation as well as robust to illumination changes and limited changes of viewpoint. For indexing, the image is characterized by a set of scale invariant points; the scale associated with each point allows the computation of a scale invariant descriptor. Our descriptors are, in addition, invariant to image rotation, of affine illumination changes and robust to small perspective deformations. Experimental results for indexing show an excellent performance up to a scale factor of 4 for a database with more than 5000 images."

Our method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. Such transformations introduce significant changes in the point location as well as in the scale and the shape of the neighbourhood of an interest point. Our approach allows to solve for these problems simultaneously. It is based on three key ideas : 1) The second moment matrix computed in a point can be used to normalize a region in an affine invariant way (skew and stretch). 2) The scale of the local structure is indicated by local extrema of normalized derivatives over scale. 3) An affine-adapted Harris detector determines the location of interest points. A multi-scale version of this detector is used for initialization. An iterative algorithm then modifies location, scale and neighbourhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. For matching and recognition, the image is characterized by a set of affine invariant points; the affine transformation associated with each point allows the computation of an affine invariant descriptor which is also invariant to affine illumination changes. A quantitative comparison of our detector with existing ones shows a significant improvement in the presence of large affine deformations. Experimental results for wide baseline matching show an excellent performance in the presence of large perspective transformations including significant scale changes. Results for recognition are very good for a database with more than 5000 images."

Although the scale of the mean-shift kernel is a crucial parameter, there is presently no clean mechanism for choosing or updating scale while tracking blobs that are changing in size. We adapt Lindeberg's (1998) theory of feature scale selection based on local maxima of differential scale-space filters to the problem of selecting kernel scale for mean-shift blob tracking. We show that a difference of Gaussian (DOG) mean-shift kernel enables efficient tracking of blobs through scale space. Using this kernel requires generalizing the mean-shift algorithm to handle images that contain negative sample weights."

                "text": "The most deliberate part of first-language teaching is the business of telling a child what each thing is called. We ordinarily speak of the name of a thing as if there were just one, but in fact, of course, every referent has many names. The dime in my pocket is not only a dime. It is also money, a metal object, a thing, and, moving to subordinates, it is a 1952 dime, in fact a particular 1952 dime with a unique pattern of scratches, discolorations, and smooth places. When such an object is named for a very young child how is it called? It may be named money or dime but probably not metal object, thing, 1952 dime, or particular 1952 dime. The dog out on the lawn is not only a dog but is also a boxer, a quadruped, an animate being; it is the landlord's dog, named Prince. How will it be identified for a child? Sometimes it will be called a dog, sometimes Prince, less often a boxer, and almost never a quadruped, or animate being. Listening to many adults name things for many children, I find that their choices are quite uniform and that I can anticipate them from my own inclinations. How are these choices determined and what are their consequences for the cognitive development of the child? Adults have notions about the kind of language appropriate for use with children. Especially strong and universal is the belief that children have trouble pronouncing long names and so should always be given the shortest possible names. A word is preferable to a phrase and, among words, a monosyllable is better than a polysyllable. This predicts the preference for dog and Prince over boxer, quadruped, and animate being. It predicts the choice of dime over metal object and particular 1952 dime. Zipf (10) has shown that the length of a word (in phonemes or syllables) is inversely related to its frequency in the printed language. Consequently the shorter names for any thing will usually also be the most frequently used names for that thing, and so it would seem that the choice of a name is usually predictable from either frequency or brevity. The monosyllables dog and Prince have much higher frequencies according to the Thorndike-Lorge list (8) than do the polysyllables boxer, quadruped, and animate being. It sometimes happens, however, that the frequency-brevity principle makes the wrong prediction. The thing called a pineapple is also fruit. Fruit is the shorter and more frequent term, but adults will name the thing pineapple. Similarly they will say apple, banana, orange, and even pomegranate; all of them longer and less frequent words than the perfectly appropriate fruit. Brevity seems not to be the powerful determinant we had imagined. The frequency principle can survive this kind of example, but only if it is separated from counts like the Thorndike-Lorge of over-all frequency in the printed language. On the whole the word fruit appears more often than the word pineapple (and also is shorter), but we may confidently assume that, when pineapples are being named, the word pineapple is more frequent than the word fruit. This, of course, is a kind of frequency more directly relevant to our problem. Word counts of general usage are only very roughly applicable to the prediction of what will be said when"

To account for these variations, the algorithm simulates the process of image formation in 3D space, using computer graphics, and it estimates 3D shape and texture of faces from single images. The estimate is achieved by fitting a statistical, morphable model of 3D faces to images. The model is learned from a set of textured 3D scans of heads. We describe the construction of the morphable model, an algorithm to fit the model to images, and a framework for face identification. In this framework, faces are represented by model parameters for 3D shape and texture. We present results obtained with 4,488 images from the publicly available CMU-PIE database and 1,940 images from the FERET database."

The feature of interest, an eye for example, is described by a parameterized template. An energy function is defined which links edges, peaks, and valleys in the image intensity to corresponding properties of the template. The template then interacts dynamically with the image by altering its parameter values to minimize the energy function, thereby deforming itself to find the best fit. The final parametr values can be used as descriptors for the feature. We illustrate this method by showing deformable templates detecting eyes and mouths in real images. We demonstrate their ability for tracking features."

Employing the sample point estimator, we define the Variable Bandwidth Mean Shift, prove its convergence, and show its superiority over the fixed bandwidth procedure. The second technique has a semiparametric nature and imposes a local structure on the data to extract reliable scale information. The local scale of the underlying density is taken as the bandwidth which maximizes the magnitude of the normalized mean shift vector. Both estimators provide practical tools for autonomous image and quasi real-time video analysis and several examples are shown to illustrate their effectiveness."

These SAHN clustering methods are defined by a paradigmatic algorithm that usually requires 0(n3) time, in the worst case, to cluster the objects. An improved algorithm (Anderberg 1973), while still requiring 0(n3) worst-case time, can reasonably be expected to exhibit 0(n2) expected behavior. By contrast, we describe a SAHN clustering algorithm that requires 0(n2 logn) time in the worst case. When SAHN clustering methods exhibit reasonable space distortion properties, further improvements are possible. We adapt a SAHN clustering algorithm, based on the efficient construction of nearest neighbor chains, to obtain a reasonably general SAHN clustering algorithm that requires in the worst case 0(n2) time and space.Whenevern objects are characterized byk-tuples of real numbers, they may be clustered by any of a family of centroid SAHN clustering methods. These methods are based on a geometric model in which clusters are represented by points ink-dimensional real space and points being agglomerated are replaced by a single (centroid) point. For this model, we have solved a class of special packing problems involving point-symmetric convex objects and have exploited it to design an efficient centroid clustering algorithm. Specifically, we describe a centroid SAHN clustering algorithm that requires 0(n2) time, in the worst case, for fixedk and for a family of dissimilarity measures including the Manhattan, Euclidean, Chebychev and all other Minkowski metrics."

Given n sets, this procedure permits their reduction to n \u2212 1 mutually exclusive sets by considering the union of all possible n(n \u2212 1)/2 pairs and selecting a union having a maximal value for the functional relation, or objective function, that reflects the criterion chosen by the investigator. By repeating this process until only one group remains, the complete hierarchical structure and a quantitative estimate of the loss associated with each stage in the grouping can be obtained. A general flowchart helpful in computer programming and a numerical example are included."

We now apply the theory to the problem of shape matching. The shocks are organized into a directed, acyclic shock graph, and complexity is managed by attending to the most significant (central) shape components first. The space of all such graphs is highly structured and can be characterized by the rules of a shock graph grammar. The grammar permits a reduction of a shock graph to a unique rooted shock tree. We introduce a novel tree matching algorithm which finds the best set of corresponding nodes between two shock trees in polynomial time. Using a diverse database of shapes, we demonstrate our system's performance under articulation, occlusion, and moderate changes in viewpoint."

Repeatability rate evaluates the geometric stability under different transformations. Information content measures the distinctiveness of features. Different interest point detectors are compared using these two criteria. We determine which detector gives the best results and show that it satisfies the criteria well."

The <italic>k</italic>-d tree is defined and examples are given. It is shown to be quite efficient in its storage requirements. A significant advantage of this structure is that a single data structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently. Various utility algorithms are developed; their proven average running times in an <italic>n</italic> record file are: insertion, <italic>O</italic>(log <italic>n</italic>); deletion of the root, <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>(<italic>k</italic>-1)/<italic>k</italic></supscrpt>); deletion of a random node, <italic>O</italic>(log <italic>n</italic>); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches), <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic> log <italic>n</italic>). Search algorithms are given for partial match queries with <italic>t</italic> keys specified [proven maximum running time of <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>(<italic>k</italic>-<italic>t</italic>)/<italic>k</italic></supscrpt>)] and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average running time of <italic>O</italic>(log <italic>n</italic>).] These performances far surpass the best currently known algorithms for these tasks. An algorithm is presented to handle any general intersection query. The main focus of this paper is theoretical. It is felt, however, that <italic>k</italic>-d trees could be quite useful in many applications, and examples of potential uses are given."

By large it is meant that most of the index must be stored on secondary memory. By dynamic it is meant that insertions and deletions are intermixed with queries, so that the index cannot be built beforehand. A new data structure, the K-D-B-tree, is presented as a solution to this problem. K-D-B-trees combine properties of K-D-trees and B-trees. It is expected that the multidimensional search effieciency of balanced K-D-trees and the I/O efficiency of B-trees should both be approximated in the K-D-B-tree. Preliminary experimental results that tend to support this are reported."

The goal of such a system is data compression: to reduce the bit rate so as to minimize communication channel capacity or digital storage memory requirements while maintaining the necessary fidelity of the data. The mapping for each vector may or may not have memory in the sense of depending on past actions of the coder, just as in well established scalar techniques such as PCM, which has no memory, and predictive quantization, which does. Even though information theory implies that one can always obtain better performance by coding vectors instead of scalars, scalar quantizers have remained by far the most common data compression system because of their simplicity and good performance when the communication rate is sufficiently large. In addition, relatively few design techniques have existed for vector quantizers. During the past few years several design algorithms have been developed for a variety of vector quantizers and the performance of these codes has been studied for speech waveforms, speech linear predictive parameter vectors, images, and several simulated random processes. It is the purpose of this article to survey some of these design techniques and their applications."

Learning for SPCA is also done with an EM algorithm.
