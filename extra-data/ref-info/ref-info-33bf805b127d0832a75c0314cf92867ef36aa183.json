The proposed method is capable of segmenting pages with non-rectangular layout as well as with various angles of skew. The characteristics of the method are as follows: (1) thinning of the background enables us to represent white areas of any shape as connected thin lines or chains and the robustness for tilted page images is also achieved by the representation; and (2) based on this representation, the task of page segmentation is defined as to find the loops enclosing printed areas. The task is achieved by eliminating unnecessary chains using not only a feature of white areas, but also a feature of black areas divided by a chain. Based on the experimental results and the comparison with previous methods, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the proposed method."

This method is based on the analysis of the background white space that surrounds the printed regions on the page. It does not make any assumptions about the shape of the regions as opposed to most earlier approaches which assume that printed regions are rectangular. It is capable of identifying and describing regions of complex shapes more accurately than existing methods. It requires no a priori knowledge. The background white space is covered with tiles and the contour of each region is identified by tracing through these white tiles that encircle it. The method can segment page images with severe skew without skew correction. The white tiles on the image can also be used in subsequent document analysis processes such as the classification of the image regions."

Based on the extraction of the background, it offers the benefit of being adaptive to the context of the document and to be insensitive to the orientation of the text blocks. It involves a two-dimensional isotropic structuring element used to characterized the white streams. This element is a disk approximated by a regular octagon which can be recursively generated. Another advantage of the proposed method is that a hierarchical segmentation can be derived from the image built upon the octagonal pattern. This tree allows to perform an isotropic multi-scale smearing, which leads to a physical segmentation. The algorithms are based on an input-time tracing principle and use a single scan of the image, they are very well suited to a real-time implementation."

We present a number of benefits to using the Voronoi neighborhood definition; however, we argue that definitions based upon the point Voronoi diagrams are insufficient in the general case (e.g. for grouping image elements in line drawings). We give the definition of a generalized (Euclidean distance measure, 2D Cartesian space, and an area based generator set) Voronoi tessellation and then present our algorithm for approximating this generalized tessellation. The algorithm is constructed from a normal point Voronoi tessellation algorithm. A parameterized Voronoi neighborhood graph (VNG) which can be derived from the tessellation is defined. A graph algorithm for grouping based on the VNG, its image elements, and Voronoi cell descriptors can then be easily derived. We show some results of how this algorithm was used in a map understanding system."

The algorithm outputs two images, one containing text strings and the other graphics. These images can then be processed by suitable character recognition and graphics recognition systems. The performance of the algorithm, both in terms of its effectiveness and computational efficiency, was evaluated using several test images and showed superior performance compared to other techniques. >"
