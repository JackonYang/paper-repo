To remove this bottleneck, new document processing techniques must be introduced to automatically acquire knowledge from various types of documents. By presenting a survey on the techniques and problems involved, this paper aims at serving as a catalyst to stimulate research in automatic knowledge acquisition through document processing. In this study, a document is considered to have two structures: geometric structure and logical structure. These play a key role in the process of the knowledge acquisition, which can be viewed as a process of acquiring the above structures. Extracting the geometric structure from a document refers to document analysis; mapping the geometric structure into logical structure is regarded as document understanding. Both areas are described in this paper, and the basic concept of document structure and its measurement based on entropy analysis is introduced. Logical structure and geometric models are proposed. Both top-down and bottom-up approaches and their entropy analyses are presented. Different techniques are discussed with practical examples. Mapping methods, such as tree transformation, document formatting knowledge and document format description language, are described. >"

Several critical functions have been investigated and the technical approaches are discussed. The first is the segmentation and classification of digitized printed documents into regions of text and images. A nonlinear, run-length smoothing algorithm has been used for this purpose. By using the regular features of text lines, a linear adaptive classification scheme discriminates text regions from others. The second technique studied is an adaptive approach to the recognition of the hundreds of font styles and sizes that can occur on printed documents. A preclassifier is constructed during the input process and used to speed up a well-known pattern-matching method for clustering characters from an arbitrary print source into a small sample of prototypes. Experimental results are included."

The method yields an accurate measure of skew, within-line, and between-line spacings and locates text lines and text blocks. It is advantageous over many other methods in three main ways: independence from skew angle, independence from different text spacings, and the ability to process local regions of different text orientations within the same image. Results of the method shown for several different page formats and for randomly oriented subpages on the same image illustrate the versatility of the method. We also discuss the differences, advantages, and disadvantages of the docstrum with respect to other lay-out methods. >"

The second application will automate the selection of suitable portions of the document ( e.g., abstracts) for subsequent optical character recognition for full-text search of journals and reports in paper form.

This parameter is based on the document image complexity and is obtained from the number of transitions from white to black pixels or vice versa. The other idea is that skew is detected in local regions in which only text lines are expected. Such local regions are extracted from a document image automatically and the obtained skew angle is defined as the overall document skew. Document skew has been measured in experiments with an error of 0.12 degrees on the average for all test documents.<<ETX>>"

With this growing degree of office automation the paper-computer interface becomes increasingly important. To be useful, this interface must be able to handle documents containing text as well as graphics, and convert them into an electronic representation that not only captures content (like in current OCR readers), but also the layout and logic structure. We describe a system for the analysis of business letters which is able to extract the key elements of a letter like its sender, the date, etc. The letter can thus for instance be stored in electronic archival systems, edited by structure editors, or forwarded via electronic mail services. This system was implemented on a Symbolics Lisp machine for the high level part of the analysis and on a VAX for the low and medium level processing stages. Some practical results are presented and discussed. Apart from this application our system is a useful testbed to implement and test sophisticated control structures and model representations for image understanding."

The initial stages of the system perform image enhancement functions such as adaptive thresholding, morphological processing, and skew detection and correction. The image segmentation process consists of smearing the original image via the run length smoothing algorithm, calculating the connected components locations and statistics, and filtering (segmenting) the image based on these statistics. The text regions can be converted (via an optical character reader) to a computer-searchable form, and the nontext regions can be extracted and preserved. The rule-based structure allows easy fine tuning of the algorithmic steps to produce robust rules, to incorporate additional tools (as they become available), and to handle special segmentation needs.<<ETX>>"

Because the Hough transform is computationally expensive, the amount of data within a document image is reduced through the computation of its horizontal and vertical black runlengths. Histograms of these runlengths are used to determine whether the document is in portrait or landscape orientation. A gray scale burst image is created from the black runlengths that are perpendicular to the text lines by placing the length of the run in the run's bottom-most pixel. By creating a burst image from the original document image, the processing time of the Hough transform can be reduced by a factor of as much as 7.4 for documents with gray-scale images. Because only small runlengths are input to the Hough transform and because the accumulator array is incremented by the runlength associated with a pixel rather than by a factor of 1, the negative effects of noise, black margins, and figures are avoided. Consequently, interline spacing can be determined more accurately.<<ETX>>"

It can discover the skew angle not only in the whole page of document but also in different document blocks which have their different skew angles. This method consists of four major phases, namely: (a) skew detection and correction for whole page; (b) segmentation of document into blocks; (c) identification of skewed text blocks, and (d) skew detection and correction for the skewed text blocks. To detect the skew in a document, the saw-tooth algorithm and least squares method are used. To segment a document into blocks, the fractal approach is applied. Promising experimental results are also provided to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method."

The algorithm outputs two images, one containing text strings and the other graphics. These images can then be processed by suitable character recognition and graphics recognition systems. The performance of the algorithm, both in terms of its effectiveness and computational efficiency, was evaluated using several test images and showed superior performance compared to other techniques. >"

The corresponding subimage is then presented to a human operator or a machine reader (optical character reader) that can read the zip code and, if necessary, other address information and direct the mail piece to the appropriate sorting bin. Analysis of physical characteristics of mail pieces indicates that in order to automate the address finding task, several different image analysis operations are necessary. Some examples are locating a rectangular white address label on a multicolor background, progressively grouping characters into text lines and text lines into text blocks, eliminating candidate regions by specialized detectors (for example, detecting regions such as postage stamps), and identifying handwritten regions. Described here are several operations, their utility as predicted by statistics of mail piece characteristics, and the results of applying the operations to a task set of mail piece images. A problem-solving architecture based on the blackboard model of problem solving for appropriately invoking the tools and combining their results is described."

In experiments using CCITT standard documents, a detection accuracy of less than 0.1 degrees is obtained for printed documents.

This approach can be used to process documents with high geometrical complexity. Experiments have been conducted to prove the proposed new approach for document processing."

(c) The values S~*\u00a2 for M* are computed. 1 (d) The values of S~j are multiplied by p ~ .

(2) These S~s are (in the sense of Theorem 4) used in the nearest \"higher\" subgraphs to compute Si*5 for them until the Si.i in the highest (\"outermost\") graph G are computed.

                "text": "Techniques for the recognition of totally unconstrained handwritten numerals are developed and tested on a large set (8540 numerals) of real-life Postal ZIP code samples. Different approaches, including statistical, structural and hybrid are developed and their performance measured. \nThe use of extended characteristic loci codes with statistical approach as a front-end recognizer and predictor of an unknown character has been investigated. The expected prediction capability of this approach lies in the interval (90%, 100%). Its recognition reliability ranges in the interval (88.55%, 89.02%) with substitution and rejection rates between (10.40%, 10.85%) and (5.23%, 5.32%) respectively. \nA new approach to define and extract structural features based on edge classification has been implemented. Shapes, such as holes, simple cavities and end points, are used as structural features and the relational data-model is used as a tool to organize the information related to each shape. Furthermore, a fuzzy set theoretic technique has been developed for the identification of unknown characters. The structural approach is used as a back-end recognizer, and the unknown characters are identified by incorporating the predicted information as well as the structural identification score. Its recognition reliability lies in the interval (99.06%, 99.8%) with substitution and rejection rates between (0.18%, 0.73%) and (7.13%, 22.48%) respectively. \nIn the hybrid approach, unknown characters are identified either by the statistical approach or structural approach. Characters with strong predictions (normal characters) are recognized by the statistical approach and those with weak prediction (abnormal characters) by the structural approach. Using this approach, one of the many possible combinations of the statistical and structural recognition schemes has been investigated, and its recognition reliability improved to the interval (95.94%, 96.29) with substitution and rejection rates between (3.45%, 3.96%) and (2.36%, 7.01%) respectively. \nImage processing (enhancement, binarization, and segmentation) techniques were also developed to obtain suitable binary characters from the raw images of the ZIP codes. \nThe techniques, image processing together with recognition, described in this thesis present a complete model of an optical reader for ZIP code recognition. The model, in general, is applicable to the text recognition problem."

Both from the practical and the academic point of view, very encouraging results are reported. The work is described systematically and analyzed in terms of so-called feature matching, which is likely to be the mainstream of the research and development of machine recognition of handprinted Chinese characters. A database, ETL8 (881 Kanji, 71 hirakana, and 160 variations for each category), is explained, on which many experiments were performed. Recognition rates reported using this database can be compared, and so somewhat qualitative evaluation of these methods is described. Based on the comparative study, the merits and demerits of both feature and structural matching are discussed and some future directions are mentioned."

Recognition algorithms, data bases, character models, and handprint standards are examined. Achievements in the recognition of handprinted numerals, alphanumerics, Fortran, and Katakana characters are analyzed and compared. Data quality and constraints, as well as human and machine factors are also described. Characteristics, problems, and actual results on on-line recognition of handprinted characters for different applications are discussed. New emphases and directions are suggested."

This model consists of three stages: (1) convolution of the image with a bank of even-symmetric linear filters followed by half-wave rectification to give a set of responses modeling outputs of V1 simple cells, (2) inhibition, localized in space, within and among the neural-response profiles that results in the suppression of weak responses when there are strong responses at the same or nearby locations, and (3) texture-boundary detection by using wide odd-symmetric mechanisms. Our model can predict the salience of texture boundaries in any arbitrary gray-scale image. A computer implementation of this model has been tested on many of the classic stimuli from psychophysical literature. Quantitative predictions of the degree of discriminability of different texture pairs match well with experimental measurements of discriminability in human observers."
