As a matter of fact, graph based representation offers a powerful and flexible alternative to the widely used feature vectors. However, the space of graphs contains almost no mathematical structure, and consequently, there is a lack of suitable algorithms for graph classification, clustering, and analysis. Recently, a general approach to transforming graphs into n-dimensional real vectors has been proposed. In the present paper we use this method, which can also be regarded as a novel graph kernel, and investigate the application of kernel principal component analysis (kPCA) on the resulting vector space embedded graphs. To this end we consider the common task of object classification, and show that kPCA in conjunction with the novel graph kernel outperforms different reference systems on several graph data sets of diverse nature."

                "text": "In this dissertation we introduce several novel techniques for performing data mining on web documents which utilize graph representations of document content. Graphs are more robust than typical vector representations as they can model structural information that is usually lost when converting the original web document content to a vector representation. For example, we can capture information such as the location, order and proximity of term occurrence, which is discarded under the standard document vector representation models. Many machine learning methods rely on distance computations, centroid calculations, and other numerical techniques. Thus many of these methods have not been applied to data represented by graphs since no suitable graph-theoretical concepts were previously available. \nWe introduce the novel Graph Hierarchy Construction Algorithm (GHCA), which performs topic-oriented hierarchical clustering of web search results modeled using graphs. The system we created around this new algorithm and its prior version is compared with similar web search clustering systems to gauge its usefulness. An important advantage of this approach over conventional web search systems is that the results are better organized and more easily browsed by users. \nNext we present extensions to classical machine learning algorithms, such as the k-means clustering algorithm and the k-Nearest Neighbors classification algorithm, which allows the use of graphs as fundamental data items instead of vectors. We perform experiments comparing the performance of the new graph-based methods to the traditional vector-based methods for three web document collections. Our experimental results show an improvement for the graph approaches over the vector approaches for both clustering and classification of web documents. An important advantage of the graph representations we propose is that they allow the computation of graph similarity in polynomial time; usually the determination of graph similarity with the techniques we use is an NP-Complete problem. In fact, there are some cases where the execution time of the graph-oriented approach was faster than the vector approaches."

Due to the representational power of graph structures, a number of graph-based approaches are used to answer whether a known symbol appears in a document and under which degree of confidence. In this paper, we review the particularities of graph structures representing technical drawings and we classify them in two categories, depending on whether the structure that they represent consists of prototype patterns or repetitive patterns. The recognition is then formulated in terms of graph matching or graph parsing, respectively. Since some symbols consist of two types of structures, the main contribution of this work is to propose a combined strategy. In addition, the combination of graph matching and graph parsing processes is based on a common graph structure that also involves a graph indexing mechanism. Graph nodes are classified in equivalence classes depending on their local configuration. Graph matching indexes in such equivalence classes using the information of model graph nodes as local descriptors, and then global consistency is checked using the graph edge attributes. On the other hand, representatives of equivalence classes are used as tokens of a graph grammar that guides a parsing process to recognize repetitive structures."

A large number of methods for graph matching have been proposed. Graph edit distance, for instance, defines the dissimilarity of two graphs by the amount of distortion that is needed to transform one graph into the other and is considered one of the most flexible methods for error-tolerant graph matching.This book focuses on graph kernel functions that are highly tolerant towards structural errors. The basic idea is to incorporate concepts from graph edit distance into kernel functions, thus combining the flexibility of edit distance-based graph matching with the power of kernel machines for pattern recognition. The authors introduce a collection of novel graph kernels related to edit distance, including diffusion kernels, convolution kernels, and random walk kernels. From an experimental evaluation of a semi-artificial line drawing data set and four real-world data sets consisting of pictures, microscopic images, fingerprints, and molecules, the authors demonstrate that some of the kernel functions in conjunction with support vector machines significantly outperform traditional edit distance-based nearest-neighbor classifiers, both in terms of classification accuracy and running time."

For graph data, a whole toolbox of data mining algorithms becomes available by defining a kernel function on instances of graphs. Graph kernels based on walks, subtrees and cycles in graphs have been proposed so far. As a general problem, these kernels are either computationally expensive or limited in their expressiveness. We try to overcome this problem by defining expressive graph kernels which are based on paths. As the computation of all paths and longest paths in a graph is NP-hard, we propose graph kernels based on shortest paths. These kernels are computable in polynomial time, retain expressivity and are still positive definite. In experiments on classification of graph models of proteins, our shortest-path kernels show significantly higher classification accuracy than walk-based kernels."

We also compare the performance of different graph distance measures as well as various document representations that utilize graphs.

We present a formalism showing that graph probing provides a lower bound on the true edit distance between two graphs. From an empirical standpoint, the results of two simulation studies and an experiment using scanned pages show that graph probing correlates well with the latter measure. Moreover, our technique is very fast; graphs with tens or hundreds of thousands of vertices can be compared in mere seconds. Ease of implementation, scalability, and speed of execution make graph probing an attractive alternative for graph comparison."

The basic idea is to view the edit distance of an input graph gto a number of prototype graphs as a vectorial description of g. Based on the embedded graphs, kernel k-means clustering is applied. In several experiments conducted on different graph data sets we demonstrate the robustness and flexibility of our novel graph clustering approach and compare it with a standard clustering procedure directly applied in the domain of graphs."

Attempts to incorporate some notion of term similarity include latent semantic indexing [8], the use of semantic networks [9], and probabilistic methods [5]. In this paper we propose two methods for inferring such similarity from a corpus. The first one defines word-similarity based on document-similarity and viceversa, giving rise to a system of equations whose equilibrium point we use to obtain a semantic similarity measure. The second method models semantic relations by means of a diffusion process on a graph defined by lexicon and co-occurrence information. Both approaches produce valid kernel functions parametrised by a real number. The paper shows how the alignment measure can be used to successfully perform model selection over this parameter. Combined with the use of support vector machines we obtain positive results."

It presents, at one end, fundamental concepts and notations developed in syntactic and structural pattern recognition and at the other, reports on the current state of the art with respect to both methodology and applications. In particular, it includes artificial intelligence related techniques, which are likely to become very important in future pattern recognition.The book consists of individual chapters written by different authors. The chapters are grouped into broader subject areas like \u201cSyntactic Representation and Parsing\u201d, \u201cStructural Representation and Matching\u201d, \u201cLearning\u201d, etc. Each chapter is a self-contained presentation of one particular topic. In order to keep the original flavor of each contribution, no efforts were undertaken to unify the different chapters with respect to notation. Naturally, the self-containedness of the individual chapters results in some redundancy. However, we believe that this handicap is compensated by the fact that each contribution can be read individually without prior study of the preceding chapters. A unification of the spectrum of material covered by the individual chapters is provided by the subject and author index included at the end of the book."

                "text": "Graph structures have proven computationally cumbersome for pattern analysis. The reason for this is that, before graphs can be converted to pattern vectors, correspondences must be established between the nodes of structures which are potentially of different size. To overcome this problem, in this paper, we turn to the spectral decomposition of the Laplacian matrix. We show how the elements of the spectral matrix for the Laplacian can be used to construct symmetric polynomials that are permutation invariants. The coefficients of these polynomials can be used as graph features which can be encoded in a vectorial manner. We extend this representation to graphs in which there are unary attributes on the nodes and binary attributes on the edges by using the spectral decomposition of a Hermitian property matrix that can be viewed as a complex analogue of the Laplacian. To embed the graphs in a pattern space, we explore whether the vectors of invariants can be embedded in a low-dimensional space using a number of alternative strategies, including principal components analysis (PCA), multidimensional scaling (MDS), and locality preserving projection (LPP). Experimentally, we demonstrate that the embeddings result in well-defined graph clusters. Our experiments with the spectral representation involve both synthetic and real-world data. The experiments with synthetic data demonstrate that the distances between spectral feature vectors can be used to discriminate between graphs on the basis of their structure. The real-world experiments show that the method can be used to locate clusters of graphs."

We study properties of both types of median graphs. For the more complex task of computing generalized median graphs, a genetic search algorithm is developed. Experiments conducted on randomly generated graphs demonstrate the advantage of generalized median graphs compared to set median graphs and the ability of our genetic algorithm to find approximate generalized median graphs in reasonable time.

However, these approaches are applicable to only the same kind of documents because they are based on the paradigm that specifies the structure definition information in advance so as to be able to analyze a particular class of documents intelligently. In this paper, the authors propose a method to recognize the layout structures of multi-kinds of table-form document images. For this purpose, the authors introduce a classification tree to manage the relationships among different classes of layout structures. The authors' recognition system has two modes: layout knowledge acquisition and layout structure recognition. In the layout knowledge acquisition mode, table-form document images are distinguished according to this. Classification tree and then the structure description trees which specify the logical structures of table-form documents are generated automatically. While, in the layout structure recognition mode, individual item fields in the table-form document images are extracted and classified successfully by searching the classification tree and interpreting the structure description tree. >"

Different kinds of graph matchings have been proposed such as (sub)graph isomorphism or error-tolerant graph matching, giving rise to different graph similarity measures. A first goal of this paper is to show that these different measures can be viewed as special cases of a generic similarity measure introduced in [8]. This generic similarity measure is based on a non-bijective graph matching (like [4] and [2]) so that it is well suited to image recognition. In particular, over/under-segmentation problems can be handled by linking one vertex to a set of vertices. In a second part, we address the problem of computing this measure and we describe two algorithms: a greedy algorithm, that quickly computes sub-optimal solutions, and a reactive Tabu search algorithm, that may improve these solutions. Some experimental results are given."

However, compared to the wide range of elaborated classifiers known from statistical pattern recognition, this is only a very basic method. In the present paper we propose a method for transforming strings into n-dimensional real vector spaces based on prototype selection. This allows us to subsequently classify the transformed strings with more sophisticated classifiers, such as support vector machine and other kernel based methods. In a number of experiments, we show that the recognition rate can be significantly improved by means of this procedure."

Its key advantage is that edit distance is applicable to unconstrained attributed graphs and can be tailored to a wide variety of applications by means of specific edit cost functions. Its computational complexity, however, is exponential in the number of vertices, which means that edit distance is feasible for small graphs only. In this paper, we propose two simple, but effective modifications of a standard edit distance algorithm that allow us to suboptimally compute edit distance in a faster way. In experiments on real data, we demonstrate the resulting speedup and show that classification accuracy is mostly not affected. The suboptimality of our methods mainly results in larger inter-class distances, while intra-class distances remain low, which makes the proposed methods very well applicable to distance-based graph classification."

In this paper, we firstpropose a general representation of table form documentbased on XML, which contains both structure and layoutinformation. Next, we present structure analysis systembased on graph grammar which represents document structureknowledge. As the relation between adjacent fields intable form documents become two dimensional, two dimensionalnotation is necessary to denote structural knowledge.Therefore, we adopt two dimensional graph grammar to denotethem. By using grammar notation, we can easily modifyand keep consistency of it, as the rules are relatively simple.Another advantage of using grammar notation is that,it can be used for generating documents only from logicalstructure. Experimental results have shown that the systemsuccessfully analyzed several kinds of table forms."

The method can be applied iteratively to build a kernel on a innnite set from kernels involving generators of the set. The family of kernels generated generalizes the family of radial basis kernels. It can also be used to deene kernels in the form of joint Gibbs probability distributions. Kernels can be built from hidden Markov random elds, generalized regular expressions, pair-HMMs, or ANOVA de-compositions. Uses of the method lead to open problems involving the theory of innnitely divisible positive deenite functions. Fundamentals of this theory and the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces are reviewed and applied in establishing the validity of the method."

It is based on the recognition of subgraphs homeomorphic to previously defined prototypes of characters. Gaps are identified as potential parts of characters by implementing a variant of the notion of relative neighborhood used in computational perception. Each subgraph of strokes that matches a previously defined character prototype is recognized anywhere in the word even if it corresponds to a broken character or to a character touching another one. The characters are detected in the order defined by the matching quality. Each subgraph that is recognized is introduced as a node in a directed net that compiles different alternatives of interpretation of the features in the feature graph. A path in the net represents a consistent succession of characters. A final search for the optimal path under certain criteria gives the best interpretation of the word features. Broken characters are recognized by looking for gaps between features that may be interpreted as part of a character. Touching characters are recognized because the matching allows nonmatched adjacent strokes. The recognition results for over 24,000 printed numeral characters belonging to a USPS database and on some hand-printed words confirmed the method's high robustness level. >"

We present a new approach that combines sequential, structural and chemical information into one graph model of proteins. We predict functional class membership of enzymes and non-enzymes using graph kernels and support vector machine classification on these protein graphs.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOur graph model, derivable from protein sequence and structure only, is competitive with vector models that require additional protein information, such as the size of surface pockets. If we include this extra information into our graph model, our classifier yields significantly higher accuracy levels than the vector models. Hyperkernels allow us to select and to optimally combine the most relevant node attributes in our protein graphs. We have laid the foundation for a protein function prediction system that integrates protein information from various sources efficiently and effectively.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nMore information available via www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/Mitarbeiter/borgwardt.html."

The kernels are based on the heat equation on the Riemannian manifold defined by the Fisher information metric associated with a statistical family, and generalize the Gaussian kernel of Euclidean space. As an important special case, kernels based on the geometry of multinomial families are derived, leading to kernel-based learning algorithms that apply naturally to discrete data. Bounds on covering numbers and Rademacher averages for the kernels are proved using bounds on the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on Riemannian manifolds. Experimental results are presented for document classification, for which the use of multinomial geometry is natural and well motivated, and improvements are obtained over the standard use of Gaussian or linear kernels, which have been the standard for text classification."

The method is purely structural, that is, it uses only the edge or connectivity structure of the graph and does not draw on node or edge attributes. We make two contributions: 1) commencing from a probability distribution for matching errors, we show how the problem of graph matching can be posed as maximum-likelihood estimation using the apparatus of the EM algorithm; and 2) we cast the recovery of correspondence matches between the graph nodes in a matrix framework. This allows one to efficiently recover correspondence matches using the singular value decomposition. We experiment with the method on both real-world and synthetic data. Here, we demonstrate that the method offers comparable performance to more computationally demanding methods."

The fact that it is the margin, or confidence level, of a classification--that is, a scale parameter--rather than a raw training error that matters has become a key tool for dealing with classifiers. This book shows how this idea applies to both the theoretical analysis and the design of algorithms. \nThe book provides an overview of recent developments in large margin classifiers, examines connections with other methods (e.g., Bayesian inference), and identifies strengths and weaknesses of the method, as well as directions for future research. Among the contributors are Manfred Opper, Vladimir Vapnik, and Grace Wahba."

A set of edit operations to transform one RAG into another one are defined as regions are represented by polylines and string matching techniques are used to measure their similarity. The algorithm follows a branch and bound approach driven by the RAG edit operations. This formulation allows matching computing under distorted inputs and also reaching a solution in a near polynomial time. The algorithm has been used for recognizing symbols in hand drawn diagrams."

Based on the heat equation on the Riemannian manifold defined by the Fisher information metric, information diffusion kernels generalize the Gaussian kernel of Euclidean space, and provide a natural way of combining generative statistical modeling with non-parametric discriminative learning. As a special case, the kernels give a new approach to applying kernel-based learning algorithms to discrete data. Bounds on covering numbers for the new kernels are proved using spectral theory in differential geometry, and experimental results are presented for text classification."

Only recently have researchers started investigating kernels for structured data. This paper describes how kernel definitions can be simplified by identifying the structure of the data and how kernels can be defined on this structure. We propose a kernel for structured data, prove that it is positive definite, and show how it can be adapted in practical applications."

                "text": "Kernel methods are becoming increasingly popular for various kinds of machine learning tasks, the most famous being the support vector machine (SVM) for classification. The SVM is well understood when using conditionally positive definite (cpd) kernel functions. However, in practice, non-cpd kernels arise and demand application in SVM. The procedure of \"plugging\" these indefinite kernels in SVM often yields good empirical classification results. However, they are hard to interpret due to missing geometrical and theoretical understanding. In this paper, we provide a step toward the comprehension of SVM classifiers in these situations. We give a geometric interpretation of SVM with indefinite kernel functions. We show that such SVM are optimal hyperplane classifiers not by margin maximization, but by minimization of distances between convex hulls in pseudo-Euclidean spaces. By this, we obtain a sound framework and motivation for indefinite SVM. This interpretation is the basis for further theoretical analysis, e.g., investigating uniqueness, and for the derivation of practical guidelines like characterizing the suitability of indefinite SVM."

Each character class is described by a constraint graph model. Sampling points on a character skeleton are taken as nodes in the graph. Connection constraints and position constraints are taken as arcs in the graph. For patterns of the same character class, the model captures both the topological invariance and the geometrical invariance in a general and uniform way. Character recognition is then formulated as a constraint-based optimization problem. A cooperative relaxation matching algorithm that solves this optimization problem is developed. A practical optical character recognition (OCR) system that is able to recognize multifont, multiple-size Chinese characters with a satisfactory performance was implemented. >"

The process of AG matching proceeds as follows. First, an observed AG (AGO) is constructed from single-pixel-width line-representation of an observed symbol. Second, the pose of the AGO is estimated in terms of translation, rotation and scale with respect to the model AGs (AGMs). The search space is effectively pruned by introducing the concept of control vertex and applying geometrical constraints in an early stage. In this step, a small number of candidate AGMs are selected. Third, correspondences between components of the observed AG after normalization (AGON) and those of the AGMs are found for the given poses. Fourth, distance measures between the AGON and the AGMs are calculated, based upon the correspondences. Finally, the AGON is classified as the AGM with the minimum distance. Experimental results for hand-drawn symbols with and without templates show that using AG matching is very efficient and successful for translation-, rotation- and scale-invariant recognition of hand-drawn symbols in schematic diagrams."
