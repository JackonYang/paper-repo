Basically, the proposed network is trained in a supervised fashion with labeled and unlabeled data simultaneously. For unlabeled data, Pseudo-Labels, just picking up the class which has the maximum predicted probability, are used as if they were true labels. This is in effect equivalent to Entropy Regularization. It favors a low-density separation between classes, a commonly assumed prior for semi-supervised learning. With Denoising Auto-Encoder and Dropout, this simple method outperforms conventional methods for semi-supervised learning with very small labeled data on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset."

In this paper we present an approach for training a convolutional neural network using only unlabeled data. We train the network to discriminate between a set of surrogate classes. Each surrogate class is formed by applying a variety of transformations to a randomly sampled 'seed' image patch. We find that this simple feature learning algorithm is surprisingly successful when applied to visual object recognition. The feature representation learned by our algorithm achieves classification results matching or outperforming the current state-of-the-art for unsupervised learning on several popular datasets (STL-10, CIFAR-10, Caltech-101)."

While showing impressive performance, the Ladder Network has many components intertwined, whose contributions are not obvious in such a complex architecture. This paper presents an extensive experimental investigation of variants of the Ladder Network in which we replaced or removed individual components to learn about their relative importance. For semi-supervised tasks, we conclude that the most important contribution is made by the lateral connections, followed by the application of noise, and the choice of what we refer to as the 'combinator function'. As the number of labeled training examples increases, the lateral connections and the reconstruction criterion become less important, with most of the generalization improvement coming from the injection of noise in each layer. Finally, we introduce a combinator function that reduces test error rates on Permutation-Invariant MNIST to 0.57% for the supervised setting, and to 0.97% and 1.0% for semi-supervised settings with 1000 and 100 labeled examples, respectively."

                "text": "Stochastic binary hidden units in a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network give at least three potential benefits when compared to deterministic MLP networks. (1) They allow to learn one-to-many type of mappings. (2) They can be used in structured prediction problems, where modeling the internal structure of the output is important. (3) Stochasticity has been shown to be an excellent regularizer, which makes generalization performance potentially better in general. However, training stochastic networks is considerably more difficult. We study training using M samples of hidden activations per input. We show that the case M=1 leads to a fundamentally different behavior where the network tries to avoid stochasticity. We propose two new estimators for the training gradient and propose benchmark tests for comparing training algorithms. Our experiments confirm that training stochastic networks is difficult and show that the proposed two estimators perform favorably among all the five known estimators."

We revisit the approach to semi-supervised learning with generative models and develop new models that allow for effective generalisation from small labelled data sets to large unlabelled ones. Generative approaches have thus far been either inflexible, inefficient or non-scalable. We show that deep generative models and approximate Bayesian inference exploiting recent advances in variational methods can be used to provide significant improvements, making generative approaches highly competitive for semi-supervised learning."

Successive deep stochastic hidden layers are equipped with autoregressive connections, which enable the model to be sampled from quickly and exactly via ancestral sampling. We derive an efficient approximate parameter estimation method based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle, which can be seen as maximising a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood, with a feedforward neural network implementing approximate inference. We demonstrate state-of-the-art generative performance on a number of classic data sets, including several UCI data sets, MNIST and Atari 2600 games."

This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters."

In order to overcome the low amount of labeled examples available in this setting, we introduce a new feature learning and extraction procedure based on a factor model we call spike-and-slab sparse coding (S3C). Prior work on S3C has not prioritized the ability to exploit parallel architectures and scale S3C to the enormous problem sizes needed for object recognition. We present a novel inference procedure for appropriate for use with GPUs which allows us to dramatically increase both the training set size and the amount of latent factors that S3C may be trained with. We demonstrate that this approach improves upon the supervised learning capabilities of both sparse coding and the spike-and-slab Restricted Boltzmann Machine (ssRBM) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We use the CIFAR-100 dataset to demonstrate that our method scales to large numbers of classes better than previous methods. Finally, we use our method to win the NIPS 2011 Workshop on Challenges In Learning Hierarchical Models' Transfer Learning Challenge."

Interest in SSL has increased in recent years, particularly because of application domains in which unlabeled data are plentiful, such as images, text, and bioinformatics. This first comprehensive overview of SSL presents state-of-the-art algorithms, a taxonomy of the field, selected applications, benchmark experiments, and perspectives on ongoing and future research. Semi-Supervised Learning first presents the key assumptions and ideas underlying the field: smoothness, cluster or low-density separation, manifold structure, and transduction. The core of the book is the presentation of SSL methods, organized according to algorithmic strategies. After an examination of generative models, the book describes algorithms that implement the low-density separation assumption, graph-based methods, and algorithms that perform two-step learning. The book then discusses SSL applications and offers guidelines for SSL practitioners by analyzing the results of extensive benchmark experiments. Finally, the book looks at interesting directions for SSL research. The book closes with a discussion of the relationship between semi-supervised learning and transduction.

An instantiation of SWWAE uses a convolutional net (Convnet) (LeCun et al. (1998)) to encode the input, and employs a deconvolutional net (Deconvnet) (Zeiler et al. (2010)) to produce the reconstruction. The objective function includes reconstruction terms that induce the hidden states in the Deconvnet to be similar to those of the Convnet. Each pooling layer produces two sets of variables: the \"what\" which are fed to the next layer, and its complementary variable \"where\" that are fed to the corresponding layer in the generative decoder."

The resulting algorithm is a straightforward variation on the stacking of ordinary autoencoders. It is however shown on a benchmark of classification problems to yield significantly lower classification error, thus bridging the performance gap with deep belief networks (DBN), and in several cases surpassing it. Higher level representations learnt in this purely unsupervised fashion also help boost the performance of subsequent SVM classifiers. Qualitative experiments show that, contrary to ordinary autoencoders, denoising autoencoders are able to learn Gabor-like edge detectors from natural image patches and larger stroke detectors from digit images. This work clearly establishes the value of using a denoising criterion as a tractable unsupervised objective to guide the learning of useful higher level representations."

The MP-DBM can be seen as a single probabilistic model trained to maximize a variational approximation to the generalized pseudolikelihood, or as a family of recurrent nets that share parameters and approximately solve different inference problems. Prior methods of training DBMs either do not perform well on classification tasks or require an initial learning pass that trains the DBM greedily, one layer at a time. The MP-DBM does not require greedy layerwise pretraining, and outperforms the standard DBM at classification, classification with missing inputs, and mean field prediction tasks.1"

                "text": "Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overfitting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different \"thinned\" networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets."

When trained on natural images, the layers of our model capture image information in a variety of forms: low-level edges, mid-level edge junctions, high-level object parts and complete objects. To build our model we rely on a novel inference scheme that ensures each layer reconstructs the input, rather than just the output of the layer directly beneath, as is common with existing hierarchical approaches. This makes it possible to learn multiple layers of representation and we show models with 4 layers, trained on images from the Caltech-101 and 256 datasets. When combined with a standard classifier, features extracted from these models outperform SIFT, as well as representations from other feature learning methods."

We re-evaluate the state of the art for object recognition from small images with convolutional networks, questioning the necessity of different components in the pipeline. We find that max-pooling can simply be replaced by a convolutional layer with increased stride without loss in accuracy on several image recognition benchmarks. Following this finding -- and building on other recent work for finding simple network structures -- we propose a new architecture that consists solely of convolutional layers and yields competitive or state of the art performance on several object recognition datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet). To analyze the network we introduce a new variant of the \"deconvolution approach\" for visualizing features learned by CNNs, which can be applied to a broader range of network structures than existing approaches."

This knowledge can be exploited to avoid the \"curse of dimensionality\" when learning a classifier. Explicit manifold learning formulations such as lle are rarely used for this purpose, and instead classifiers may make use of methods such as local co-ordinate coding or auto-encoders to implicitly characterise the manifold. We propose novel manifold-based kernels for semi-supervised and supervised learning. We show how smooth classifiers can be learnt from existing descriptions of manifolds that characterise the manifold as a set of piecewise affine charts, or an atlas. We experimentally validate the importance of this smoothness vs. the more natural piecewise smooth classifiers, and we show a significant improvement over competing methods on standard datasets. In the semi-supervised learning setting our experiments show how using unlabelled data to learn the detailed shape of the underlying manifold substantially improves the accuracy of a classifier trained on limited labelled data. \u00a9 2014 Springer-Verlag."

In the former case, there is a distinction between inductive semi-supervised learning and transductive learning. In inductive semi-supervised learning, the learner has both labeled training data {(xi, yi)}i=1 iid \u223c p(x, y) and unlabeled training data {xi} i=l+1 iid \u223c p(x), and learns a predictor f : X 7\u2192 Y, f \u2208 F where F is the hypothesis space. Here x \u2208 X is an input instance, y \u2208 Y its target label (discrete for classification or continuous for regression), p(x, y) the unknown joint distribution and p(x) its marginal, and typically l u. The goal is to learn a predictor that predicts future test data better than the predictor learned from the labeled training data alone. In transductive learning, the setting is the same except that one is solely interested in the predictions on the unlabeled training data {xi} i=l+1, without any intention to generalize to future test data. In the latter case, an unsupervised learning task is enhanced by labeled data. For example, in semi-supervised clustering (a.k.a. constrained clustering) one may have a few must-links (two instances must be in the same cluster) and cannot-links (two instances cannot be in the same cluster) in addition to the unlabeled instances to be clustered; in semi-supervised dimensionality reduction one might have the target low-dimensional coordinates on a few instances.

We empirically verify that the model successfully accomplishes both of these tasks.

Reconstructions can be propagated in a form of target propagation playing a role similar to back-propagation but helping to reduce the reliance on derivatives in order to perform credit assignment across many levels of possibly strong non-linearities (which is difficult for back-propagation). A regularized auto-encoder tends produce a reconstruction that is a more likely version of its input, i.e., a small move in the direction of higher likelihood. By generalizing gradients, target propagation may also allow to train deep networks with discrete hidden units. If the auto-encoder takes both a representation of input and target (or of any side information) in input, then its reconstruction of input representation provides a target towards a representation that is more likely, conditioned on all the side information. A deep auto-encoder decoding path generalizes gradient propagation in a learned way that can could thus handle not just infinitesimal changes but larger, discrete changes, hopefully allowing credit assignment through a long chain of non-linear operations. In addition to each layer being a good auto-encoder, the encoder also learns to please the upper layers by transforming the data into a space where it is easier to model by them, flattening manifolds and disentangling factors. The motivations and theoretical justifications for this approach are laid down in this paper, along with conjectures that will have to be verified either mathematically or experimentally, including a hypothesis stating that such auto-encoder mediated target propagation could play in brains the role of credit assignment through many non-linear, noisy and discrete transformations."

We exploit a novel algorithm for capturing manifold structure (high-order contractive auto-encoders) and we show how it builds a topological atlas of charts, each chart being characterized by the principal singular vectors of the Jacobian of a representation mapping. This representation learning algorithm can be stacked to yield a deep architecture, and we combine it with a domain knowledge-free version of the TangentProp algorithm to encourage the classifier to be insensitive to local directions changes along the manifold.

Today the most popular document representation is based on a vector of word counts in the document. This representation neither captures dependencies between related words, nor handles synonyms or polysemous words. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to learn text document representations based on semi-supervised autoencoders that are stacked to form a deep network. The model can be trained efficiently on partially labeled corpora, producing very compact representations of documents, while retaining as much class information and joint word statistics as possible. We show that it is advantageous to exploit even a few labeled samples during training."

We explicitly encourage the latent representation to contract the input space by regularizing the norm of the Jacobian (analytically) and the Hessian (stochastically) of the encoder's output with respect to its input, at the training points. While the penalty on the Jacobian's norm ensures robustness to tiny corruption of samples in the input space, constraining the norm of the Hessian extends this robustness when moving further away from the sample. From a manifold learning perspective, balancing this regularization with the auto-encoder's reconstruction objective yields a representation that varies most when moving along the data manifold in input space, and is most insensitive in directions orthogonal to the manifold. The second order regularization, using the Hessian, penalizes curvature, and thus favors smooth manifold. We show that our proposed technique, while remaining computationally efficient, yields representations that are significantly better suited for initializing deep architectures than previously proposed approaches, beating state-of-the-art performance on a number of datasets."

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm."

We named the LDS based regularization as virtual adversarial training (VAT). The LDS of a model at an input datapoint is defined as the KL-divergence based robustness of the model distribution against local perturbation around the datapoint. VAT resembles adversarial training, but distinguishes itself in that it determines the adversarial direction from the model distribution alone without using the label information, making it applicable to semi-supervised learning. The computational cost for VAT is relatively low. For neural network, the approximated gradient of the LDS can be computed with no more than three pairs of forward and back propagations. When we applied our technique to supervised and semi-supervised learning for the MNIST dataset, it outperformed all the training methods other than the current state of the art method, which is based on a highly advanced generative model. We also applied our method to SVHN and NORB, and confirmed our method's superior performance over the current state of the art semi-supervised method applied to these datasets."

It facilitates the training of complex neural network models by providing parametrized Theano operations, attaching metadata to Theano\u2019s symbolic computational graph, and providing an extensive set of utilities to assist training the networks, e.g. training algorithms, logging, monitoring, visualization, and serialization.

Early attempts at explaining this phenomenon focused on nonlinearity and overfitting. We argue instead that the primary cause of neural networks' vulnerability to adversarial perturbation is their linear nature. This explanation is supported by new quantitative results while giving the first explanation of the most intriguing fact about them: their generalization across architectures and training sets. Moreover, this view yields a simple and fast method of generating adversarial examples. Using this approach to provide examples for adversarial training, we reduce the test set error of a maxout network on the MNIST dataset."

In regular autoencoders, detailed information needs to be carried through the highest layers but lateral connections from encoder to decoder relieve this pressure. It is shown that abstract invariant features can be translated to detailed reconstructions when invariant features are allowed to modulate the strength of the lateral connection. Three dAE structures with modulated and additive lateral connections, and without lateral connections were compared in experiments using real-world images. The experiments verify that adding modulated lateral connections to the model 1) improves the accuracy of the probability model for inputs, as measured by denoising performance; 2) results in representations whose degree of invariance grows faster towards the higher layers; and 3) supports the formation of diverse invariant poolings."

This has led to various proposals for sampling from this implicitly learned density function, using Langevin and Metropolis-Hastings MCMC. However, it remained unclear how to connect the training procedure of regularized auto-encoders to the implicit estimation of the underlying data-generating distribution when the data are discrete, or using other forms of corruption process and reconstruction errors. Another issue is the mathematical justification which is only valid in the limit of small corruption noise. We propose here a different attack on the problem, which deals with all these issues: arbitrary (but noisy enough) corruption, arbitrary reconstruction loss (seen as a log-likelihood), handling both discrete and continuous-valued variables, and removing the bias due to non-infinitesimal corruption noise (or non-infinitesimal contractive penalty)."

In particular, we consider a problem setting motivated by the task of learning to classify web pages, in which the description of each example can be partitioned into two distinct views. For example, the description of a web page can be partitioned into the words occurring on that page, and the words occurring in hyperlinks t,hat point to that page. We assume that either view of the example would be sufficient for learning if we had enough labeled data, but our goal is to use both views together to allow inexpensive unlabeled data to augment, a much smaller set of labeled examples. Specifically, the presence of two distinct views of each example suggests strategies in which two learning algorithms are trained separately on each view, and then each algorithm\u2019s predictions on new unlabeled examples are used to enlarge the training set of the other. Our goal in this paper is to provide a PAC-style analysis for this setting, and, more broadly, a PAC-style framework for the general problem of learning from both labeled and unlabeled data. We also provide empirical results on real web-page data indicating that this use of unlabeled examples can lead to significant improvement of hypotheses in practice. *This research was supported in part by the DARPA HPKB program under contract F30602-97-1-0215 and by NSF National Young investigator grant CCR-9357793.

The random walk representation exploits any low dimensional structure in the data in a robust, probabilistic manner. We develop and compare several estimation criteria/algorithms suited to this representation. This includes in particular multi-way classification with an average margin criterion which permits a closed form solution. The time scale of the random walk regularizes the representation and can be set through a margin-based criterion favoring unambiguous classification. We also extend this basic regularization by adapting time scales for individual examples. We demonstrate the approach on synthetic examples and on text classification problems."

In order to have a better understanding of relevant issues, it is worthwhile to precisely formulate the problem and carefully analyze the value of unlabeled data under certain learning models. In this paper, we approach this problem from the statistical point of view, where we assume that a correct model of the underlying distribution is given. We demonstrate that Fisher information matrices can be used to judge the asymp-totic value of unlabeled data. We apply this methodology to both \\passive partially supervised learning\" and \\active learning\", and draw conclusions from this analysis. Experiments will be provided to support our claims."

An iterative reclassification procedure based on the n 1 + n 3 + M observations is proposed and found asymptotically optimal when M \u2192 \u221e and n 1 and n 2 are moderately large. The case of finite M is evaluated by a Monte Carlo experiment which suggests that the proposed procedure, after only one iteration, gives a rule with smaller average risk than the usual rule based on just the n 1 + n 2 classified observations."

The main benefit of this framework is that it allows for the easy development of new source separation algorithms which can be optimised for specific problems. In this framework, source separation algorithms are constructed around denoising procedures. The resulting algorithms can range from almost blind to highly specialised source separation algorithms. Both simple linear and more complex nonlinear or adaptive denoising schemes are considered. Some existing independent component analysis algorithms are reinterpreted within the DSS framework and new, robust blind source separation algorithms are suggested. The framework is derived as a one-unit equivalent to an EM algorithm for source separation. However, in the DSS framework it is easy to utilise various kinds of denoising procedures which need not be based on generative models.In the experimental section, various DSS schemes are applied extensively to artificial data, to real magnetoencephalograms and to simulated CDMA mobile network signals. Finally, various extensions to the proposed DSS algorithms are considered. These include nonlinear observation mappings, hierarchical models and over-complete, nonorthogonal feature spaces. With these extensions, DSS appears to have relevance to many existing models of neural information processing."

While the study of the parity of the classical partition function p(N, n) (where N is the set of positive integers) is a deep and di cult problem, it is easy to construct a set A for which p(A, n) is even for n large enough : as explained in a paper of I.Z. Ruzsa, A. S\u00e1rk\u00f6zy and J.-L.

In this paper we recall some properties of the sets A0(B, N), we describe the factorization into primes of the elements of the set A0({1, 2, 3}, 3), and prove that the number of elements of this set up to x is asymptotically equivalent to c x (log x)3/4 , where c = 0.937 . . ..
