                "text": "Proving lower bounds on the amount of resources needed to compute specific functions is one of the most active branches of theoretical computer science. Significant progress has been made recently in proving lower bounds in two restricted models of Boolean circuits. One is the model of small depth circuits, and in this book Johan Torkel Hastad has developed very powerful techniques for proving exponential lower bounds on the size of small depth circuits' computing functions.The techniques described in \"Computational Limitations for Small Depth Circuits\" can be used to demonstrate almost optimal lower bounds on the size of small depth circuits computing several different functions, such as parity and majority. The main tool used in the proof of the lower bounds is a lemma, stating that any AND of small fanout OR gates can be converted into an OR of small fanout AND gates with high probability when random values are substituted for the variables.Hastad also applies this tool to relativized complexity, and discusses in great detail the computation of parity and majority in small depth circuits.Contents: Introduction.

How Well Can We Compute Parity in Small Depth? Is Majority Harder than Parity?

In particular, detecting cliques of size (1/4) (m/logm)2/3 requires monotone circuits exp (\u03a9((m/logm)1/3)). For fixeds, any monotone circuit that detects cliques of sizes requiresm)s) AND gates. We show that even a very rough approximation of the maximum clique of a graph requires superpolynomial size monotone circuits, and give lower bounds for some Boolean functions.

Parallel time and number of processors for CROW PRAM\u2019s are shown to correspond respectively (and simultaneously) to depth and size for circuits, where the time-depth correspondence is to within a constant factor and the processors-size correspondence is to within a polynomial. By applying a recent result of Furst, Saxe and Sipser, we obtain the corollary that parity, integer multiplication, graph transitive closure and integer sorting cannot be computed in constant time by a CROW PRAM with a polynomial number of processors. This is the first nonconstant lower bound on the parallel time required to solve these problems by a CROW PRAM w..."
