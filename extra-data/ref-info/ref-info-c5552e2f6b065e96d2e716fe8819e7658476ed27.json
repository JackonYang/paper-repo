Two independent but neighbouring visual areas, V3 and V3A, sharing a common cytoarchitectural plan, but in each one of which the visual fields are separately represented, have been studied anatomically, functionally, and in combined anatomico\u2010physiological experiments. 2. The properties of single cells in the two areas are so similar, judged by the techniques used in this study, that it is often impossible to tell whether any one penetration was sampling from cells in V3 or V3A. This is especially so if the cells have receptive fields in the lower hemi\u2010quadrants, since the vertical meridian of the lower visual fields is represented along the V3\u2010V3A boundary and since a transition from V3 to V3A along this border is not accompanied by a shift in receptive field positions of cells. 3. Since the visual fields, including the vertical meridian, are separately represented in these two areas, and since regions of vertical meridian representation are callosally connected, a simple and certain method of specifying the boundary between V3 and V3A is to examine the degeneration following section of the callosal splenium. A heavy patch of degeneration then marks the V3\u2010V3A boundary. Within this patch, however, is a sub\u2010patch containing fewer callosal fibres, or none at all. The boundary between V3 and V3A was taken to be at this subpatch. 4. Since the horizontal meridian is represented at the V2\u2010V3 boundary, and since V1 projects to both these areas, sending coarse fibres to V3 and fine fibres to V2, it was found that the boundary between V2 and V3 could be precisely drawn by making a lesion in the horizontal meridian representation in V1 and noting where, in the prestriate cortex, fine fibres give way to coarse ones, without an intervening gap. 5. Double tracer anatomical experiments, in which tritiated proline was injected into V1 of animals whose callosal splenium had been sectioned, showed that whereas V3 receives a direct input from V1, V3A does not. V3A, instead, was found to receive an input from V3. Double tracer anatomical experiments were undertaken to study a possible input from V2 to V3A. Although such experiments did not reveal a direct input from V2 to V3A, they were not entirely conclusive. 6. The vast majority of cells in V3 and V3A were binocularly driven, without obvious monocular preferences. Some cells, however, though responding to stimulation of the individual eyes, summated their responses to binocular stimulation. Others responded only when both eyes were simulataneously stimulated. In any oblique penetration, cells preferring binocular stimulation only occurred either singly or in groups. 7. In an oblique penetration, the shift from a cell responding to binocular stimulation only to one responding equally well to stimulation of either eye was not necessarily accompanied by a shift in orientational preferences, shifts in the former..."

The topographic organization of prestriate visual cortex in the rhesus monkey has been studied both anatomically, by determining the pattern of termination of fibres passing through the corpus callosum, and physiologically, in the same animals, by plotting receptive field positions for different recording sites. Results are displayed on two\u2010dimensional, \"unfolded\" maps of the cortex in the dorsal half of the occipital lobe. 2. Transcallosal fibres terminate in a narrow strip of cortex along the boundary between striate and prestriate areas and in a separate, broader, zone occupying much of the anterior bank of the lunate sulcus, the annectant gyrus, and the parietooccipital sulcus. The detailed pattern of inputs is highly complicated but shows considerable similarities from one animal to the next. 3. Physiological recordings confirmed earlier reports that regions where transcallosal fibres terminate correspond to representations of the vertical meridian in the visual field. This relationship is most precise along the striate\u2010prestriate boundary and along the boundary of area V3 farthest from V1; it is less precise within area V4, where the pattern of transcallosal inputs is more complex. 4. A distinct, topographically organized visual area, named V3A, was found in the region between areas V3 and V4 in the lunate and parieto\u2010occipital sulci. Area V3A differs from V2 and V3 in that both superior and inferior visual quadrants are represented in a single region of the dorsal occipital lobe. 5. The contralateral visual field is represented in a suprisingly complex fashion in areas V3A and V4. Within each area there are multiple representations of some, but perhaps not all, parts of the visual hemifield. It is unclear whether V3A and V4 should be more appropriately considered as sets of distinct sub\u2010areas, each representing only a portion of the hemifield, or as larger areas with complicated internal topographies. 6. Most cells in areas V2, V3 and V3A are orientation selective but not selective for stimulus colour or direction of movement. In contrast, area V4 contains a higher incidence of colour selective cells and a lower incidence of orientation selectivity. These results support the notion of a functional division of labour within the prestriate cortex."

The afferent input to these two regions was studied in experiments where the corpus callosum was sectioned, and labelled amino acids were injected into other visual areas. By this method, it was found that area 17 projects to that part of the superior temporal sulcus occupied by the more medial of the two callosal inputs. By contrast, the part of the sulcus occupied by the more lateral callosal input was found to receive a strong projection from the fourth visual complex, an area rich in colour-coded cells. Recordings were made from single cells in the superior temporal sulcus in animals in which the corpus callosum had been sectioned previously. The degeneration produced by this procedure was used to provide anatomical landmarks enabling us to assign cells to the lateral or the medial regions of the sulcus. Such recordings revealed that receptive fields were topographically organized in the lateral part of the sulcus and that most cells were colour specific. By contrast, cells recorded from in the region of the more medial callosal patch within this sulcus were directionally selective, without any obvious colour coding. It was concluded from these combined anatomico-physiological experiments that there are at least two distinct regions in the superior temporal sulcus which have different afferent connections and functional properties."

                "text": "1. The cortical projections of the foveal and extrafoveal parts of the striate cortex have been compared, using conventional degeneration techniques, as well as combinations of anatomical methods. While both foveal and extrafoveal striate cortex share a common pattern of projections (to areas V2, V3 and the visual area in the medial part of the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus), foveal striate cortex was found to have an additional projection (to part of the cortex of the fourth visual areas, V4). The latter projection includes the posterior lip of the inferior occipital sulcus which, on anatomical grounds, is regarded as the ventral extension of V4. 2. Anatomical studies using double tracers were employed to clarify the nature of the projections from the striate cortex and from V2 to V4. In one such experiment, tritiated proline was injected into extra\u2010foveal striate cortex and a small lesion was made in that part of V2 receiving a direct projection from the region of the striate cortex into which the radioactive tracer was injected. Only degenerating fibres (due to the lesion), and no radioactive label, was found in V4. Such an experiment showed that, unlike foveal striate cortex, the projections from extrafoveal striate cortex to V4 are not direct, but through V2. 3. In another type of anatomical experiment using double tracers, the corpus callosum was sectioned and tritiated proline was injected into foveal striate cortex. Such an experiment allowed a more accurate determination of the extent of V4, as judged from its callosal connexions, to which foveal striate cortex projects. 4. Considering the projections of V1 to areas V2, V3 and the visual area in the medial part of the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus, and considering the differences in the projections of foveal and extrafoveal striate cortex, it is suggested that, among other functions, the striate cortex acts as a distribution centre for the information coming over the retino\u2010geniculo\u2010cortical pathways, parcelling this information out to different visual areas of the prestriate cortex for further analysis."

In the present study, all the recordings in V2 were made in the posterior bank of the lunate sulcus. The regions from which recordings were made and which are acceptable, without any doubt or ambiguity even in the absence of callosal landmarks, as being in V2 are boxed in the sections shown in Text-fig. 3. Perhaps the most striking feature of V2 is the heavy concentration of orientation selective cells (about 75 %), even though cells not selective for orientation are also present (see Text-fig. 3). Other functional categories are also represented in V2. For example, 14% of the cells in this area had clear directional selectivities and 2*3% were directionally biased. The percentage of opponent-colour cells was low (8.4 %) and 5-6% of the cells were colour biased. Hence the total percentage of cells in V2 showing colour selectivity in their responses is 14%, a figure not much higher than that given for area 17 (VI) by Hubel & Wiesel (1968). In considering the colour selectivities of cells in V2, it is important to emphasize that the receptive fields of all the cells recorded from in this area were within the central 50, a region in which colour vision is good."
