We consider the images as points in a metric space in which we wish to move around so as to locate image neighborhoods of interest, based on color information. The data base images are mapped to distributions in color space, these distributions are appropriately compressed, and then the distances between all pairs I; J of images are computed based on the work needed to rearrange the mass in the compressed distribution representing I to that of J . We also propose the use of multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques to embed a group of images as points in a twoor three-dimensional Euclidean space so that their distances are preserved as much as possible. Such geometric embeddings allow the user to perceive the dominant axes of variation in the displayed image group. In particular, displays of 2-d MDS embeddings can be used to organize and re ne the results of a nearest-neighbor query in a perceptually intuitive way. By iterating this process, the user is able to quickly navigate to the portion of the image space of interest."

Potential applications include medical (`Give me other images that contain a tumor with a texture like this one'), photo-journalism (`Give me images that have blue at the top and red at the bottom'), and many others in art, fashion, cataloging, retailing, and industry. Key issues include derivation and computation of attributes of images and objects that provide useful query functionality, retrieval methods based on similarity as opposed to exact match, query by image example or user drawn image, the user interfaces, query refinement and navigation, high dimensional database indexing, and automatic and semi-automatic database population. We currently have a prototype system written in X/Motif and C running on an RS/6000 that allows a variety of queries, and a test database of over 1000 images and 1000 objects populated from commercially available photo clip art images. In this paper we present the main algorithms for color texture, shape and sketch query that we use, show example query results, and discuss future directions."

In the index we store the cumulative color histograms. The L1-, L2-, L(infinity )-distance between two cumulative color histograms can be used to define a similarity measure of these two color distributions. We show that this method produces slightly better results than color histogram methods, but it is significantly more robust with respect to the quantization parameter of the histograms. The second technique is an example of a new approach to color indexing. Instead of storing the complete color distributions, the index contains only their dominant features. We implement this approach by storing the first three moments of each color channel of an image in the index, i.e., for a HSV image we store only 9 floating point numbers per image. The similarity function which is used for the retrieval is a weighted sum of the absolute differences between corresponding moments. Our tests clearly demonstrate that a retrieval based on this technique produces better results and runs faster than the histogram-based methods."

The channels are represented by a bank of even-symmetric Gabor filters that nearly uniformly covers the spatial-frequency domain. Feature images are obtained by subjecting each (selected) filtered image to a nonlinear transformation and computing a measure of energy around each pixel. Region-based segmentations are obtained by using a square-error clustering algorithm. Edge-based segmentations are obtained by applying an edge detector to each feature image and combining their magnitude responses. An integrated segmentation technique that combines the strengths of the previous two techniques while eliminating their weaknesses is proposed. The integrated approach is truly unsupervised, since it eliminates the need for knowing the exact number of texture categories in the image.<<ETX>>"

Completeness criteria for 2D Gabor image representations are important because of their increasing role in many computer vision applications and also in modeling biological vision, since recent neurophysiological evidence from the visual cortex of mammalian brains suggests that the filter response profiles of the main class of linearly-responding cortical neurons (called simple cells) are best modeled as a family of self-similar 2D Gabor wavelets. We therefore derive the conditions under which a set of continuous 2D Gabor wavelets will provide a complete representation of any image, and we also find self-similar wavelet parametrization which allow stable reconstruction by summation as though the wavelets formed an orthonormal basis. Approximating a \"tight frame\" generates redundancy which allows low-resolution neural responses to represent high-resolution images."

Specifically, a set of qualitative assumptions is shown to imply the contrast model, which expresses the similarity between objects as a linear combination of the measures of their common and distinctive features. Several predictions of the contrast model are tested in studies of similarity with both semantic and perceptual stimuli. The model is used to uncover, analyze, and explain a variety of empirical phenomena such as the role of common and distinctive features, the relations between judgments of similarity and difference, the presence of asymmetric similarities, and the effects of context on judgments of similarity. The contrast model generalizes standard representations of similarity data in terms of clusters and trees. It is also used to analyze the relations of prototypicality and family resemblance"

We approximated in computational form six basic textural features, namely, coarseness, contrast, directionality, line-likeness, regularity, and roughness. In comparison with psychological measurements for human subjects, the computational measures gave good correspondences in rank correlation of 16 typical texture patterns. Similarity measurements using these features were attempted. The discrepancies between human vision and computerized techniques that we encountered in this study indicate fundamental problems in digital analysis of textures. Some of them could be overcome by analyzing their causes and using more sophisticated techniques."
