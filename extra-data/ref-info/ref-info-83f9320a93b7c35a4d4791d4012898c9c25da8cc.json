We have examined the responses of simple cells in the cat's atriate cortex to visual patterns that were designed to reveal the extent to which these cells may be considered to sum light\u2010evoked influences linearly across their receptive fields. We used one\u2010dimensional luminance\u2010modulated bars and grating as stimuli; their orientation was always the same as the preferred orientation of the neurone under study. The stimuli were presented on an oscilloscope screen by a digital computer, which also accumulated neuronal responses and controlled a randomized sequence of stimulus presentations. 2. The majority of simple cells respond to sinusoidal gratings that are moving or whose contrast is modulated in time in a manner consistent with the hypothesis that they have linear spatial summation. Their responses to moving gratings of all spatial frequencies are modulated in synchrony with the passage of the gratings' bars across their receptive fields, and they do not produce unmodulated responses even at the highest spatial frequencies. Many of these cells respond to temporally modulated stationary gratings simply by changing their response amplitude sinusoidally as the spatial phase of the grating the grating is varied. Nonetheless, their behavior appears to indicate linear spatial summation, since we show in an Appendix that the absence of a 'null' phase in a visual neurone need not indicate non\u2010linear spatial summation, and further that a linear neurone lacking a 'null' phase should give responses of the form that we have observed in this type of simple cell. 3. A minority of simple cells appears to have significant non\u2010linearities of spatial summation. These neurones respond to moving gratings of high spatial frequency with a partially or totally unmodulated elevation of firing rate. They have no 'null' phases when tested with stationary gratings, and reveal their non\u2010linearity by giving responses to gratings of some spatial phases that are composed partly or wholly of even harmonics of the stimulus frequency ('on\u2010off' responses). 4. We compared simple receptive fields with their sensitivity to sinusoidal gratings of different spatial frequencies. Qualitatively, the most sensitive subregions of simple cells' receptive fields are roughly the same width as the individual bars of the gratings to which they are most sensitive. Quantitatively, their receptive field profiles measured with thin stationary lines, agree well with predicted profiles derived by Fourier synthesis of their spatial frequency tuning curves."

                "text": "1. All complex cells in the cat's striate cortex exhibit gross non\u2010linearities of spatial summation when tested with sinusoidal grating stimuli. Their responses to moving gratings of all but the lowest spatial frequencies are usually dominated by a component that is not modulated by the passage of the bars of the grating across the receptive field. They give responses to temporally modulated stationary gratings that consist mostly of even harmonics of the stimulus frequency and that vary little in amplitude or wave form as the spatial phase of the grating is varied. 2. We compared complex cells' receptive fields with their sensitivity to sinusoidal gratings of different spatial frequencies. Qualitatively, the receptive fields are usually two to five times wider than the bars of the gratings that stimulate them most effectively. Quantitatively, the receptive field profiles of complex cells are invariably broader than those predicted by Fourier synthesis of their spatial frequency tuning curves, and in particular lack predicted spatially antagonistic regions. 3. We further examined the receptive field organization of these cells, using pairs of stationary lines flashed synchronously on their receptive fields. If both lines are of the same polarity (bright or dark), complex cells respond to the paired stimulus much less well than they do to either of its component bars, unless the bars are separated by less than about one quarter of the width of the receptive field. If the lines are of opposite polarity, one bright and one dark, the opposite situation obtains: closely spaced bars elicit small responses, while paired bars of larger separation are much more effective. In either case, the results are independent in general character of the absolute positions of the stimuli within the receptive field; rather, they depend in a manner characteristic of each cell on the relative positions of the two bars. 4. The two\u2010line interaction profile that plots the change in a complex cell's response to one bar as a function of the position of a second added bar corresponds closely to the receptive field profile predicted from Fourier synthesis of the cell's spatial frequency tuning curve. These profiles may thus reveal the spatial characteristics of subunits within complex cell\u2010receptive fields. We examined the nature of the interaction between these subunits by performing several two\u2010line interaction experiments in which the onset of the second bar was delayed some time after the onset of the first. The results suggest that neighbouring subunits interact in a facilitatory fashion: for an interval after the presentation of one bar, responses to neighbouring bars are enhanced. 5. The subunits of a complex receptive field may, by their spatial properties, determine the spatial selectivities of complex cells, while the nature of the interaction among the subunits may determine these cells' sensitivity and selectivity for moving visual stimuli..."

Recordings were taken from optic tract fibres of anaesthetized, paralysed cats. 2. When an alternating phase sine wave grating was used as a stimulus, X cells had null positions and Y cells responded at all positions of the grating. 3. These results did not depend on the temporal wave form or the temporal frequency of pattern alternation over a wide range. 4. At high spatial frequencies for the particular cell, a Y cell gave abig 'on\u2010off' response, or frequency doubling, at all positions of the grating, while an X cell did not. 5. The use of contrast sensitivity versus spatial phase also served to differentiate the two cell types. With an alternating sine grating stimulus X cells had a sinusoidal dependence on spatial phase, while each Y cell's sensitivity depended in a complicated manner on spatial phase. 6. Sensitivity versus spatial phase for different Fourier components of the neural response also separated the two classes of cells. Significant second harmonic distortion was present in Y cells. The second harmonic component was spatial phase insensitive, and became dominant at high spatial frequencies. 7. The maximum of the 2nd/1st harmonic ratio was taken as an index of nonlinearity. X cells always had a nonlinearity index less than 1 while in Y cells this index always exceeded 1. 8. Response to spots, diffuse light and drifting gratings were compared to the nonlinearity index as a basis for classifying cells. The nonlinearity index was most reliable because it was least dependent on retinal eccentricity."

                        "text": "4C): all the neurones we encountered more than 2-5 mmn into the cortex had optimum spatial frequencies below 05 c/deg; indeed three neurones showed no obvious decline in sensitivity as spatial frequency was reduced down to 0 03 c/deg. Fig. 4B plots the distance of each receptive field from the vertical meridian of the visual field. Although there was little change in eccentricity during the first 2 mm of the penetration (probably due to the relatively high magnification factor in the central representation in area 17: Talbot & Marshall, 1941; Tusa et al. 1978), beyond 2-5 mm there was a clear trend for the receptive fields to move along the horizontal meridian away from the centre of the visual field. An extrapolation of this trend suggests that the border between area 17 and 18 was traversed during the region between 2 and 2-5 mm in which we were unable to isolate neurones. At the end of the experiment we withdrew the electrode and made a lesion at a depth of 2-25 mm; the position of this lesion is indicated on the tracing in Fig. 4A; it lies less than 0-25 mm from the cytoarchitectonically defined border between the two areas. The penetration illustrated in Fig. 4 was restricted to the upper layers ofthe cortex; Fig. 5 shows a similar reconstruction of another penetration which traversed all the cellular layers of both areas 17 and 18 except layer VI. This penetration was placed near H-C A3; in this region the border between the two areas lies on the medial side of the lateral gyrus, and the region of the visual field about 5 deg below the horizontal meridian is represented (Otsuka & Hassler, 1962; Hubel & Wiesel, 1965; Tusa et al. 1978). For the first 2 mm of this penetration the neurones and background activity behaved similarly to that described above for area 18; most of the neurones preferred spatial frequencies of 0-25 c/deg or less. In the next 1P5 mm, only three neurones were recorded; two of these had properties similar to those encountered earlier in the penetration; the third had properties reminiscent of area 17. Inspection of the receptive field eccentricities (Fig. 5B) suggests that the border between the two areas lay in this region; and a lesion placed there lies very close to the cytoarchitectonic border (lesion a, Fig. 5A). Beyond this region we encountered only cells typical of area 17, having small receptive fields and preferring spatial frequencies between 0 4 and 1.3 c/deg. These results are typical of those we have obtained in several micro-electrode penetrations that sampled from both cortical areas: neurones in area 17 had a preference (on average) for spatial frequencies about three times (or 1P5 octaves) higher than those in area 18. Despite this clear trend, we felt it important to ensure that uneven sampling across the visual field did not account for these differences, optimum spatial frequencies would certainly be expected to decline with retinal eccentricity. We therefore performed several other recording experiments designed to cover a reasonable range of eccentricity in both areas. We also took care to sample as evenly as possibly from the different layers of the cortex; Gilbert (1977) has reported laminar variations in receptive field size in area 17, and similar variations may well occur in area 18."

It is possible, of course, that the Y cells subserve different functional roles in area 17 (where they are only a fraction of the afferent relay) and in area 18 (where they may be the dominant component). But the observation that the functional synaptic organization of the geniculate input to areas 17 and 18 is very similar makes this notion less attractive (Singer, Tretter & Cynader, 1975; Tretter, Cynader & Singer, 1975). Other factors may also contribute to the properties of area 18 cells: LeVay & Ferster (1977) have claimed that the neurones projecting to area 18 from the laminar lateral geniculate nucleus are in fact different from those projecting to area 17."

Spatial frequency contrast sensitivity functions for the fundamental and second harmonic responses of Y cells to alternating phase gratings were determined. 3. The fundamental spatial frequency response was predicted by the Fourier transform of the sensitivity profile of the Y cell. The high spatial frequency cut\u2010off of a Y cell's fundamental response was in this way related to the centre of the cell's receptive field. 4. The second harmonic response of a Y cell did not cut off at such a low spatial frequency as the fundamental response. This result indicated that the source of the second harmonic was a spatial subunit of the receptive field smaller in spatial extent than the centre. 5. Contrast sensitivity vs. spatial phase for a Y cell was measured under three conditions: a full grating, a grating seen through a centrally located window, a grating partially obscured by a visual shutter. The 2nd/1st harmonic sensitivity ratio went down with the window and up with the shutter. These results implied that the centre of Y cells was linear and also that the nonlinear subunits extended into the receptive field surround. 6. Spatial localization of the nonlinear subunits was determined by means of a spatial dipole stimulus. The nonlinear subunits overlapped the centre and surround of the receptive field and extended beyond both. 7. The nature of the Y cell nonlinearity was found to be rectification, as determined from measurements of the second harmonic response as a function of contrast. 8. Spatial models for the Y cell receptive field are proposed."

The majority of cells recorded from animals with intact visual cortex exhibited orientation selectivity, directional selectivity, and could be independently activated through either eye. All cells responded well to moving targets and nearly all of them exhibited broadly tuned preferences with respect to speed of the target. Over 45% of cells responded optimally or exclusively at very fast (above 50 degrees/s) speeds. 3. The majority of neurons recorded from animals with intact visual cortex responded weakly but clearly to appropriately oriented localized stationary stimuli flashed on and off. About one-third of the cells responded with mixed on-off discharges from all over their receptive field. In the receptive fields of 10% of cells, separate on- and off-discharge regions could be revealed. In the receptive fields of the remaining cells, only on- or only off-discharge regions could be revealed. 4. The majority of neurons recorded after ablation of area 17 were orientation selective; 50% of the cells were also direction selective. All neurons responded well to moving targets; about 65% of them responded optimally or exclusively at very fast target speeds. 5. Destruction of the dorsolateral part of contralaterial area 17 and most of contralateral area 18 caused significant reduction in proportion of cells in area 18 which could be activated through either eye. 6. The majority of neurons recorded after ablation responded to appropriately oriented localized stationary stimuli flashed on and off. Cells with mixed on-off discharge regions all over the receptive field with separate on- and off-discharge regions and with only on- or only off-discharge regions were found. 7. It is concluded that the processing of afferent visual information in area 18 is, to a great extent, independent of the information carried to this area by associational fibers from cells of area 17."

Responses to stimuli moving at different velocities were examined. 2. Peak evoked firing frequency, rather than fotal evoked spikes, is used throughout as a measure of response. The former mea\u2010ure gives curves of response vs. velocity that correlate well with curves of contrast sensitivity vs. velocity, wheras the latter does not. 3. Cortical receptive fields were classified according to the criteria of Hubel & Wiesel. Simple cells were found to prefer lower velocities (mean 2\u20102 deg sec\u20101) than complex cells (mean 18\u20138 deg sec\u20101). The response of simple cells to stimuli moving faster than 20 deg sec\u20101 is generally poor; complex cells usually discharge briskly to these speeds. 4. Cells classified as hypercomplex by the end\u2010inhibition criterion were further chara\u2010terized as type I or type II, according to the suggestion of Dreher (1972). Type I units are indistinguishable from simple cells in their velocity tuning, and type II units equally clearly resemble complex cells. These results are therefor consistent with Dreher's sbudivision. 5. Teh selectivity of cells for velocity is variable but can be quite marked. The average selectivities of simple and complex cells are not significantly different. There is an inverse correlation between preferred velocity and the sharpness of velocity selectivity for simple cells; no trend is apparent for other cell types. 6. No clear correlation is observed between the velocity preferances of units and their degree of direction selectivity, or receptive field arrangement. Simple cells with \u2018sustainef\u2019 temporal responses to flashed stimuli tend to prefer slower rates of movement than \u2018transient\u2019 ones, and to be less selective for velocity. 7. The results for different cortical cell\u2010types are compared with the velocity tuning of X\u2010 and Y\u2010cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus."

Patterns of alternating light and dark bars with a sinusoidal luminance profile across the bars\u2014sinusoidal gratings\u2014are commonly used to study spatial interactions in the visual system.

Lateral geniculate neurones of the cat were studied in terms of the latency for activation by local electrical stimulation of the retina, the latency of electrical activation from the visual cortex and properties of receptive fields. Most of the units were relay cells (antidromic activation from visual cortex) but a small proportion were trans\u2010synaptically activated from the cortex. The latter group included units with on\u2010off, on\u2010centre or off\u2010centra receptive fields. 2. Direct activation of lateral geniculate neurones from local electrical stimulation of retinal ganglion cells or their axons in the retina was identified by the sharpness of timing of the elicited impulses. This procedure revealed the existence of slowly conducting axons relaying in the lateral geniculate nucleus. 3. The distribution of latencies for direct activation from the retina was bimodal with an extended tail of long values. It is similar to the distribution of antidromic latencies of retinal ganglion cells following stimulation of the optic tract. 4. There was a tendency for geniculate neurones with fast input from the retina to have fast axons to the visual cortex and correspondingly for medium\u2010speed and slow input. 5. The previous classification of geniculate receptive fields into sustained and transient types was extended to include commonly encountered 'brisk' and uncommonly encountered 'sluggish' varieties of each. The extension was based on visual properties and latency for direct electrical activation from the retina. Units with receptive fields differing from the familiar on\u2010centre or off\u2010centre concentric pattern were encountered rarely; they included colour\u2010coded fields, local\u2010edge\u2010detectors and one edge\u2010inhibitory off\u2010centre type."

                "text": "The purposes of this study were 1) to relate the receptive-field characteristics of area 17 cells to their afferent and efferent connections, and 2) to obtain quantitative data from area 17 neurons for later comparison with area 18 cells. Intra- and extracellular recordings were obtained in paralyzed preparations which were anesthetized with nitrous oxide. The connectivities of the recorded cells were determined from responses to electrical stimulation of afferent and efferent pathways. In parallel to the classification of units as simple and complex cells, the receptive fields were grouped in four classes according to the spatial arrangement of on- and off-areas; class I, fields with exclusive on- or off-areas; class II, fields with spatially separate on- and off-areas; class III, fields with mixed on-off areas; class IV, fields which could not be mapped with stationary stimuli. The results from electrical stimulation suggest two major classes of cells: cells in the first group are driven mainly or exclusively by LGN afferents. They rarely receive additional excitation from intrinsic or callosal afferents and rarely possess corticofugal axons. Cells in the second group receive either converging inputs from LGN afferents and further intrinsic afferents or only from intrinsic afferents. They frequently received additional input from callosum and from recurrent collaterals of corticofugal axons. They project subcortically more often than cells in the first group. Cells in both groups can be driven either by X- or Y-type afferents. Cells in the first group have mainly class I and class II fields or simple fields, whereas the neurons in the second group have mainly class III and class IV fields or complex fields. Thus, simple and complex cells differ in their connectivity patterns, but the discriminative parameter is neither the selective connection to the X- or the Y-system nor, in a strict sense, the synaptic distance from subcortical input. From the combined consideration of receptive-field properties and connectivity patterns it is concluded that class I and class II cells or simple cells are concerned mainly with the primary analysis of subcortical activity, whereas class III and class IV cells or complex cells perform a correlative analysis between highly convergent activity from extrinsic and intrinsic afferents."

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

The area explored was located on the lateral gyrus between the Horsley-Clarke coordinates A1 to 4 and L3 to 4. The receptive-field properties of area 18 cells and their responses to electrical stimulation of afferent and efferent pathways were measured with the same methods as described previously in area 17. Mutual correlations among these items were calculated and compared with the respective data from area 17. The results of this correlative analysis revealed numerous similarities between the two areas with regard to their afferent and efferent connections and their intrinsic organization. Consequently, the structure of the receptive fields and their numerical distribution resembled those in area 17. The same was true for the correlations between receptive-field parameters and afferent and efferent connectivity. The main differences were that area 18 cells had larger receptive fields and responded to considerably higher stimulus velocities. It is suggest-d that these differences are caused by the fact that area 18 receives subcortical afferents of the Y-type, whereas the dominant input to area 17 comes from the X-system. It is concluded that the area investigated in this study is organized in parallel to area 17 and deals with other aspects of visual information than area 17."

Pyramidal cells appeared to be the source of cortico\u2010geniculate, cortico\u2010collicular and cortico\u2010cortical projections. The proportion of cells within a layer that terminated in a given site varied from layer to layer: apparently all of the large pyramids in layer V had terminals in the superior colliculus, about half of the pyramids in layer VI had terminals in the lateral geniculate nucleus, while only a small proportion of the pyramids in layers II and III had terminals in any single cortical area.

This claim was based on lesions made by a particular stereotaxic approach to the LGN, and we thought it worthwhile to see whether a different stereotaxic approach, which avoided the corpus callosum, would give the same result. We found no evidence of a crossed geniculo-striate projection in either cat or monkey, but in the course of this work made the unexpected finding that the LGN in the cat projects to three separate ipsi-lateral areas of neo-cortex. These comprise visual areas I and II and the lateral part of the middle suprasylvian gyrus. Visual areas I and II have been shown to correspond to areas 17 and 18 of Otsuka & Hassler (1962), by Bilge, Seneviratne & Whitteridge (1963) and Hubel & Wiesel (1965). We have not found these cytoarchitectonic boundaries sufficiently well defined to be useful for localizing the degenerated projections. Various control lesions have been made to determine whether the projections to visual area IL and the suprasylvian gyrus arise in the LGN or in neighbouring structures."

All three types of cell project to the visual cortex by way of relay cells in the geniculate complex that have receptive field properties and axonal conduction velocities similar to those oftheir 'parent' ganglion cells (Cleland et al. 1971; Hoffman, Stone & Sherman, 1972; Wilson & Stone, 1975; Cleland, Levick, Morstyn & Wagner, 1976). All three types of cell appear to project to area 17 from the laminar portion of the lateral geniculate nucleus, but area 18 appears to receive input only from Y and W cells, many ofwhich are located in the ventral layers of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and also in the medial interlaminar nucleus (Rosenquist et al. 1974; Gilbert & Kelly, 1975; LeVay & Ferster, 1977; Hollander & Vanegas, 1977; Garey & Blakemore, 1977).

In the monkey terminal degeneration is restricted to area 17; again degenerating fibres ascend to layer IV where there is dense fragmentation, but in contrast to the cat there is also a second, less dense, but distinct, band in layer Illb. A little fine, horizontal fibre degeneration is present in layer I and there is slight terminal degeneration in this site and in layer V. Electron microscopy shows that degenerating terminals are recognizable in the visual cortex at several stages according to survival period, but that most stages can exist simultaneously in any one site, and that all are associated with asymmetrical membrane thickenings. Mapping of electron microscopic sections confirms the laminar pattern seen with the light microscope. In area 17 of the cat and monkey and in area 19 of the cat over 80% of degenerating terminals end on dendritic spines, the rest making synaptic contact mainly with dendritic shafts, and very few with the soma of stellate cells, but in area 18 some 10 % are related to stellate cell bodies. In layer IV of all areas degenerating terminals tend to occur in clusters which are separated by approximately 100 \u03bcm. Where degenerating thalamic afferents end on cell somata or varicose dendrites almost all are identifiable as derived from stellate cells. Although it is difficult to identify positively the parent dendrites bearing the spines which receive the majority of the thalamo-cortical afferents, it is suggested that some, at least, of them may also originate from stellate cells."

First, relay cells of the LGNd have either onor off-center receptive fields (16), because each relay cell receives direct excitatory drive from either onor off-center retinal ganglion cells (6, 16). Second, retinal ganglion cells fall into two groups (X-cells and Y-cells) according to whether they sum the influences of the center and surround regions of their receptive fields linearly or nonlinearly (8). Most LGNd relay cells can be similarly classified because most receive direct excitatory drive from either Xor Y-type retinal ganglion cells (6). Third, each relay cell receives direct excitatory drive from either fastor slow-conducting retinal afferents, and its own axon is correspondingly either fast or slow conducting (6, 36). The two latter parameters are closely correlated since Y-cells have been shown to have fast axons and Xcells, slow axons (6, 11). The on/off organization is independent of the other two parameters, however. Roth Y-cells and Xcells can have either onor off-center fields. This report examines several features of the LGNd relay in the normal cat, extending previous concepts and establishing a spectrum of normal properties against which the properties of the LGNd in deprived cats (described in the following paper (3W can be compared. First, the separate relay in the LGNd of the Xand Y-cell activity of the retina is described. Second, several properties of Xand Y-cells of the LGNd were observed to vary con-"

Following lesions which are limited to area 17, the medium and small cells of the main laminae of the nucleus degenerate; damage restricted to area 18 does not result in any localized, severe degeneration, but combined destruction of areas 17 and 18 causes all the cells\u2014large, medium and small\u2014of the main laminae and the central interlaminar nucleus to degenerate. Cellular change in the medial interlaminar nucleus is only found after involvement of area 19. When the cortex of the middle suprasylvian gyrus is removed in addition to these areas the degeneration in the lateral geniculate nucleus is much more severe, and there is loss of the laminar pattern due to severe gliosis in the central interlaminar nucleus. There is a well-defined topical organization in the geniculo-cortical projection, and in the antero-posterior dimension it is the same to all areas of the visual cortex, anterior parts of the nucleus projecting anteriorly and posterior parts posteriorly. Medial parts of the main laminae are related to the lateral part of area 17 and to the medial part of area 18, and lateral parts of the laminae project to the medial part of area 17 and to the lateral part of area 18. After partial lesions which involve both areas 17 and 18 the cellular degeneration affects the laminae differentially along their antero-posterior extent, that in lamina A being the most anterior and that in lamina B the most posterior; in sagittal sections such a band, or column, of degeneration passes from antero-superior to postero-inferior at right angles to the plane of the laminae."

                "text": "Zusammenfassung1.Die Cyto- und Myeloarchitektonik der Areae striata, occipitalis und praeoccipitalis (17, 18, 19 nach Brodmann) wurden bei der Katze an vier Frontal-, drei Sagittal- und zwei Horizontalschnittserien untersucht, die an Nachbarschnitten f\u00fcr Zell- und Markscheidendarstellung gef\u00e4rbt wurden. Zur Frage der Variationsbreite der Windungen der Hemisph\u00e4re, wurden 84 weitere Katzengehirne makroskopisch \u00fcberpr\u00fcft.2.Die untersuchten Rindenfelder des Katzengehirns weisen unterschiedliche charakteristische cyto- und myeloarchitektonische Strukturen auf. Das spezifische Merkmal der Area striata ist die Gliederung der besonders breiten IV. Schicht (Lamina granularis interna) in zwei Unterschichten (IVa + b und IVc) (bistri\u00e4re Form des Calcarinatypus nach Brodmann), die Pr\u00e4gnanz der VI. Schicht und die Schmalheit und Verschmelzung der II. und III. Schicht.In der Area occipitalis ist die III. Schicht sehr breit und in zwei Unterschichten (IIIa und IIIb) differenziert, wobei nur die Unterschicht IIIb gro\u00dfe Pyramidenzellen aufweist.Dagegen zeigt die Area praeoccipitalis keine spezifischen Besonderheiten, au\u00dfer der hellen kleinzelligen IIIa und einzelnen sehr gro\u00dfen Pyramidenzellen in der V.3.Die Areae striata, occipitalis und praeoccipitalis haben im Katzengehirn folgenden Sitz und Lagebeziehungen: Die Area striata nimmt auf der medialen Hemisph\u00e4renfl\u00e4che den Gyrus splenialis, suprasplenialis, postsplenialis und auf der Konvexit\u00e4t einen medialen Streifen des Gyrus lateralis und den Gyrus postlateralis ein. Die Area occipitalis befindet sich nur auf der Konvexit\u00e4t in der Mitte des Gyrus lateralis, direkt lateral an die Area striata anschlie\u00dfend, und erstreckt sich in den Furchengrund des Sulcus postlateralis. Die Area praeoccipitalis umgibt sowohl die Area striata als auch die Area occipitalis. Sie besetzt die mediale Wand und den Grund des Sulcus lateralis sowie den Grund des Sulcus splenialis, oft aber auch einen Teil des Gyrus suprasplenialis posterior.4.Die Gyri lateralis und postlateralis zeigen makroskopisch Variationen, die in vier Haupttypen eingeteilt werden. Der h\u00e4ufigste Typ I besitzt einen Gyrus lateralis ohne L\u00e4ngsfurche. Beim II. Typ, der eine tiefe zus\u00e4tzliche L\u00e4ngsfurche (Sulcus accessorius intralateralis) im Gyrus lateralis aufweist, erscheint die Area occipitalis an der Oberfl\u00e4che schmaler, obwohl die absolute Breite der Area occipitalis infolge ihrer Ausdehnung in dieser Furche gleich ist wie bei den F\u00e4llen ohne zus\u00e4tzliche Furche.5.Die Topographie der Areae striata, occipitalis und praeoccipitalis hat im Katzenhirn folgende Besonderheiten: 1. die Area striata breitet sich weiter rostralw\u00e4rts aus, 2. die Area occipitalis befindet sich nur auf der Konvexit\u00e4t und 3. die Area praeoccipitalis umgibt die Areae striata und occipitalis kontinuierlich.6.Die Besonderheiten der Lageverh\u00e4ltnisse der Areae striata und occipitalis, die anders sind als meist angenommen, sollten bei physiologischen und mikrophysiologischen Untersuchungen ber\u00fccksichtigt werden. Der auff\u00e4llige Faserreichtum und die starke Differenzierung der Area occipitalis wird im Zusammenhang mit der Frage des Rindenfeldes der optischen Wahrnehmung hervorgehoben."
