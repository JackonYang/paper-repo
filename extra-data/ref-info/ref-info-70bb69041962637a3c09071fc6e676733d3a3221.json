HTML tables do not come with a rigid schema and almost any forms of two-dimensional tables are acceptable according to the HTML grammar. This relaxation complicates the process of retrieving hierarchical data from HTML tables. In this paper, we propose an automated approach for retrieving hierarchical data from HTML tables. The proposed approach constructs the content tree of an HTML table, which captures the intended hierarchy of the data content of the table, without requiring the internal structure of the table to be known beforehand. Also, the user of the content tree does not deal with HTML tags while retrieving the desired data from the content tree. Our approach can be employed by (i) a query language written for retrieving hierarchically structured data, extracted from either the contents of HTML tables or other sources, (ii) a processor for converting HTML tables to XML documents, and (iii) a data warehousing repository for collecting hierarchical data from HTML tables and storing materialized views of the tables. The time complexity of the proposed retrieval approach is proportional to the number of HTML elements in an HTML table."

As a result, how to capture information in HTML tables semantically and integrate relevant information is a challenge. In this paper, we present a new approach that automatically captures the semantic hierarchies of HTML tables, and semi-automatically integrates HTML tables. It first automatically captures the attribute-value pairs in HTML tables by normalization, and introduces the notion of eigenvalue in formatting information to recognize the headings of HTML tables. After generating the global concepts and global schema manually by defining what data to be integrated, it then learns the lexical semantic set for each global concept, the contexts via labelling the attributes of example HTML tables to their corresponding global concept. Finally, it integrates the data of each source HTML table using the lexical semantic sets and the contexts to eliminate the conflicts and solve the nondeterministic problems in mapping each source schema to the global schema."

For this, we need a system to identify the boundary between attributes and values of a table in HTML and transform tables into more understandable attributevalue pairs. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for this purpose. The outline of the algorithm is that if we find a row(or column) having low similarity with other rows (or columns), it is probably an attribute name row (or column), otherwise value data rows(or columns). The algorithm based on this idea results in 82% accuracy of recognition of lengthways and 78% accuracy of recognition of sideways for 300 tables in HTML of Web pages downloaded from the Web."

Table understanding on the web has many potential applications including web mining, knowledge management, and web content summarization and delivery to narrow-bandwidth devices. Although in HTML documents tables are generally marked as ?table? elements, a ?table? element does not necessarily indicate the presence of a genuine relational table. Thus the important first step in table understanding in the web domain is the detection of the genuine tables. In our earlier work we designed a basic rule-based algorithm to detect genuine tables in major news and corporate home pages as part of a web content filtering system. In this paper we investigate a machine learning based approach that is trainable and thus can be automatically generalized to including any domain. Various features reflecting the layout as well as content characteristics of tables are explored. The system is tested on a large database which consists of 1, 393 HTML files collected from hundreds of different web sites from various domains and contains over 10,000 leaf ?table? elements. Experiments were conducted using the cross validation method. The machine learning based approach outperformed the rule-based system and achieved an F-measure of 95.88%."

We also argue that the visual cues embedded within the HTML text, are utilized by the authors to direct the viewer on how to read the contents contained a web table properly. We develop a framework for comprehensively analyzing the structural aspects of a web table, within which rules are devised to process and extract attribute-value pairs from the table.

A table offers a preeminent clue in text mining because it contains meaningful data displayed in rows and columns. However, tables are used on the Internet for both knowledge structuring and document design. Therefore, we were interested in determining whether or not a table has meaningfulness that is related to the structural information provided at the abstraction level of the table head. Accordingly, we: 1) investigated the types of tables present in HTML documents, 2) established the features that distinguished meaningful tables from others, 3) constructed a training data set using the established features after having filtered any obvious decorative tables, and 4) constructed a classification model using a decision tree. Based on these features, we set up heuristics for table head extraction from meaningful tables, and obtained an F-measure of 95.0 percent in distinguishing meaningful tables from decorative tables and an accuracy of 82.1 percent in extracting the table head from the meaningful tables."

In this paper we describe a general solution to the problem of recognizing the structure of a detected table region. First hierarchial clustering is used to identify columns and then spatial and lexical criteria to classify headers. We also address the problem of evaluating table structure recognition. Our model is based on a directed acyclic attribute graph, or table DAG. We describe a new paradigm, 'random graph probing,' for comparing the results returned by the recognition system and the representation created during ground-truthing. Probing is in fact a general concept that could be applied to other document recognition tasks and perhaps even other computer vision problems as well."

In practice, encoding the layout of each information source is impossible. This work presents a novel semantic search approach capable of extracting information from general tables. Semantic ontology allows our agents to read tables in the same knowledge domain with different layouts. In addition, a system of layout syntax and a set of transformation rules are defined to transform tables into databases without losing their semantic meanings."

While techniques for evaluating the performance of lower-level document analysis tasks such as optical character recognition have gained acceptance in the literature, attempts to formalize the problem for higher-level algorithms, while receiving a fair amount of attention in terms of theory, have generally been less successful in practice, perhaps owing to their complexity. In this paper, we introduce intuitive, easy-to-implement evaluation schemes for the related problems of table detection and table structure recognition. We also present the results of several small experiments, demonstrating how well the methodologies work and the useful sorts of feedback they provide. We first consider the table detection problem. Here algorithms can yield various classes of errors, including non-table regions improperly labeled as tables (insertion errors), tables missed completely (deletion errors), larger tables broken into a number of smaller ones (splitting errors), and groups of smaller tables combined to form larger ones (merging errors). This leads naturally to the use of an edit distance approach for assessing the results of table detection. Next we address the problem of evaluating table structure recognition. Our model is based on a directed acyclic attribute graph, or table DAG. We describe a new paradigm, \u201cgraph probing,\u201d for comparing the results returned by the recognition system and the representation created during ground-truthing. Probing is in fact a general concept that could be applied to other document recognition tasks as well."
