We mainly deal with the various methods that were proposed to realize the core of recognition in a word recognition system. These methods are discussed in view of the two most important properties of such a system: the size and nature of the lexicon involved, and whether or not a segmentation stage is present. We classify the field into three categories: segmentation-free methods, which compare a sequence of observations derived from a word image with similar references of words in the lexicon; segmentation-based methods, that look for the best match between consecutive sequences of primitive segments and letters of a possible word; and the perception-oriented approach, that relates to methods that perform a human-like reading technique, in which anchor features found all over the word are used to boot-strap a few candidates for a final evaluation phase."

Several component processes of a recognition system for isolated offline cursive script words are described. A word image is transformed through a hierarchy of representation levels: points, contours, features, letters, and words. A unique feature representation is generated bottom-up from the image using statistical dependences between letters and features. Ratings for partially formed words are computed using a stack algorithm and a lexicon represented as a trie. Several novel techniques for low- and intermediate-level processing for cursive script are described, including heuristics for reference line finding, letter segmentation based on detecting local minima along the lower contour and areas with low vertical profiles, simultaneous encoding of contours and their topological relationships, extracting features, and finding shape-oriented events. Experiments demonstrating the performance of the system are also described. >"

The alignment approach permits recognition of character instances that appear embedded in connected strings. A system embodying this approach has been implemented and tested on five different word sets. The performance was stable both across words and across writers.

As of December 1998 the database includes 556 forms produced by approximately 250 different writers. The database consists of full English sentences. It could serve as a basis for a variety of handwriting recognition tasks. The main focus, however is on recognition techniques that use linguistic knowledge beyond the lexicon level. This knowledge can be automatically derived from the corpus or it can be supplied from external sources."

We present a system for recognizing off-line cursive English text guided in part by global characteristics of the handwriting. A new method for finding the letter boundaries based on minimizing a heuristic cost function is introduced. The function is evaluated at each point along the baseline of the word to find the best possible segmentation points. The algorithm tries to find all the actual letter boundaries and as few additional ones as possible. After a normalization step that removes much of the style variation, the normalized segments are classified by a one hidden layer feedforward neural network. The word recognition algorithms find the segmentation points that are likely to be extraneous and generates all possible final segmentations of the word by either keeping or removing them. Interpreting the output of the neural network as posterior probabilities of letters, it then finds the word that maximizes the probability of having produced the image, over a set of 30,000 words and over all the possible final segmentations. We compared two hypotheses for finding the likelihood of words that are in the lexicon and found that using a Hidden Markov Model of English is significantly less successful than assuming independence among the letters of a word. In our initial test involving multiple writers, 68% of the words were in the top three choices."

We use two structural representations of the word, strokes and graphemes, each of them being analyzed using a Markov model. These simple models are individually optimized by a rigorous choice of the order for fitting the structural properties of the observed data using Akaike information criteria. The conditional probability to have a word model, given the observation sequence, is computed by taking into account the length of the sequence.

                "text": "A method for recognizing unconstrained handwritten words belonging to a small static lexicon is proposed. Previous approaches typically attempt to recognize characters or parts of characters in order to recognize words. Our approach, in its first step, bypasses the notion of characters. In addition to language independence, our method is more context oriented and should prove to be more robust against poor handwriting, spelling mistakes, noise and the like. Our computational theory is based on a psychological model of the reading process of a fast reader. First a few graphical clues such as ascenders, descenders and their relative positions are extracted from the word. If these prove not to be sufficient to clearly identify the word, then details (secondary features including first and last characters of words) are extracted to enhance the word recognition. \nWe designed and collected a database of bank cheques both in English and French. This resulted in a one of its kind database in a university setting dealing with hand-written information from bank cheques, both in terms of the size of the database as well as the number of different writers involved. We further designed an innovative, simple yet powerful in place tagging procedure for our database. It enables us to extract at will not only the bitmaps of words, characters, digits, lines, commas, etc... but also all kinds of contextual information. \nWe developed a fully trainable word recognizer with the requirement that the switch to a different database and/or language shall not require any redesign nor any extensive retraining time. The number of parameters within the system has been kept to a minimum and whenever possible we designed algorithms that require no parameters and therefore no training. Such an example is our slant correction algorithm that shines by its simplicity and robustness. Whenever parameters might need to be adjusted to a specific database, it is done automatically by running some genetic algorithms. \nWe tested the generality and adaptability of our system on 2 different databases of bank cheques (respectively English and French). We noticed that the system's parameters did not need to be readjusted for it to perform satisfactorily when the switch was made from one database to the other. At the time of this dissertation, our survey indicates that this research is the only one in the literature which can handle English cheques and our results are comparable to those published on the processing of French cheques. Our preliminary results on the French database report a recognition rate of 98.9% and 94.3% on the word and the full legal amount respectively among the top 5 choices."

We limit the scope of our study to the off-line recognition of isolated cursive words. First of all, we justify why we chose McClelland & Rumelhart's (1981) reading model as the inspiration for our system. A brief resume/spl acute/ of the method's behavior is presented and the main originalities of our model are underlined. After this, we focus on the new updates added to the original system: a new baseline extraction module, a new feature extraction module and a new generation, validation and hypothesis insertion process. After implementation of our method, new results have been obtained on real images from a training set of 184 images, and a testing set of 100 images, and are discussed. We are concentrating now on validating the model using a larger database."

A new method for nding the letter boundaries, based on minimizing a heuristic cost function, is introduced. The function is evaluated at each point along the baseline of the word to nd the best possible segmentation points. The algorithm tries to nd all the actual letter boundaries and as few additional ones as possible. After size and slant normalizations, the segments are classi ed by a one hidden layer feedforward neural network. The word recognition algorithm nds the segmentation points that are likely to be extraneous and generates all possible nal segmentations of the word, by either keeping or removing them. Interpreting the output of the neural network as posterior probabilities of letters, it then nds the word that maximizes the probability of having produced the image, over a set of 30,000 words and over all the possible nal segmentations. We compared two hypotheses for nding the likelihood of words that are in the lexicon and found that using a Hidden Markov Model of English is signi cantly less successful than assuming independence among the letters of a word. In our initial test with multiple writers, 61% of the words were recognized correctly."

In contrast to other systems, whole lines of text are the basic units for the recognizer. Thus the difficult problem of segmenting a line of text into individual words can be avoided. Another novel feature of the system is the incorporation of a statistical language model into the recognizer. Experiments on the database described previously by the authors (1999) have shown that a recognition rate on the word level of 79.5% and 60.05% for small (776 words) and larger (7719 words) vocabularies can be reached. These figures increase to 84.3% and 67.32% if the top ten choices are taken into account."

Several recently proposed word recognition algorithms use the strategy of directly matching the stroke segments (with OCR estimates) to the sequence of characters in each lexicon word. This idea works very well under ideal conditions; however, many applications require the recognition of text in the presence of document noise, poor handwriting and lexicon errors. These factors require careful design of the matching strategy such that a moderate amount of any form of degradation does not cause a recognition failure. A segment-to-string matching algorithm is proposed which robustly recovers from moderate levels of noise and system errors. This algorithm is developed in the context of a complete word recognition system and serves as its final post-processing module."

This task is performed by humans using extended or limited linguistic context. Their performance rate is to give an upper bound on recognition rates of computer programs designed to recognize handwritten letters in mixed-script writing. Many recognition algorithms are being developed in the research community, and there is a need for establishing ways to compare them. As some effort is on its way to give large test sets with standard formats, we propose an algorithm to determine a test set of reduced size that is appropriate for the task to achieve (the type of texts or words to be recognized). Also, with respect to a particular task, we propose a method for finding an upper limit to the letter recognition rate to aim for."

In order to compensate for this behaviour, several choices of the WR must be initially considered. In the case of handwritten sentence/phrase recognition, linguistic constraints may be applied in order to improve the results of the WR. This paper discusses two statistical methods of applying linguistic constraints to the output of an WR on input consisting of sentences/phrases. The first is based on collocations and can be used to promote lower ranked word choices or to propose new words. The second is a Markov model of syntax and is based on syntactic categories (tags) associated with words. In each case, we show the improvement in the word recognition rate as a result of applying these constraints."

The scope of this study is limited to offline recognition of isolated cursive words. First, this paper describes McClelland and Rumelhart's reading model, which formed the basis of the system. The method's behavior is presented, followed by the main original contributions of our model which are: the development of a new technique for baseline extraction, an architecture based on the chosen reading model (hierarchical, parallel, with local representation and interactive activation mechanism), the use of significant perceptual features in word recognition such as ascenders and descenders, the creation of a fuzzy position concept dealing with the uncertainty of the location of features and letters, and the adaptability of the model to words of different lengths and languages. After a description of our model, new results are presented."

We have introduced into our model some characteristics specific to cursive script. First, we use more appropriate features such as ascenders and descenders. Second, we deal with the ambiguity of letter location by introducing the concept of the fuzzy position. The location as well as the missing letters are deduced from the context (i.e. the word-letter lexicon). After implementation of our method, preliminary qualitative results have been obtained and are discussed.

It is built upon several procedures for preprocessing, a neural network to recognize individual characters in a word, and a hidden Markov model for the recognition of complete words. As neural network we use a time delay neural network that receives input from a sliding window, which scans an input word from left to right. The network is trained with the back-propagation algorithm which is expanded by position invariant learning. Because of the enormous need of computation resources we developed a method to include more information in the learning procedure. As a result only about a third of the cycles in the training are needed to achieve the same recognition results. Alternatively keeping the number of training cycles constant, an increase in word recognition rate of about 5% to a total of 87% can be achieved."

Thus linguistic knowledge beyond the lexicon level is incorporated in the recognition process. Another novel feature of the system is that the HMM is applied in such a way that the difficult problem of segmenting a line of text into individual words is avoided. A number of experiments with various language models and large vocabularies have been conducted. The language models used in the system were also analytically compared based on their perplexity."

The method is based on an efficient combination of hidden Markov models (hmms) and causal Markov random fields (mrfs). It operates in a holistic manner, at the pixel level, on scaled binary word images which are assumed to be random field realizations. The state-related random fields act as smooth local estimators of specific writing strokes by merging conditional pixel probabilities along the columns of the image. The hmm component of our model provides an optimal switching mechanism between sets of mrf distributions in order to dynamically adapt to the features encountered during the left-to-right image scan. Experiments performed on a French omni-scriptor, omni-bank database of handwritten legal check amounts provided by the A2iA company are described in great detail."

The aim is to determine what sort of observations gives a first degree of handwriting characterization before initiating a text recognition process. In the case of handwriting consisting of few words, such literal amounts on cheques, this first degree of characterization can be obtained for each word, independent of signification, by extracting the measures of some pertinent observations. Outcomes of this characterization are, to a certain extent, a distinction between significants which characterise the author and signification which is the semantic aspect. Based on an analysis of 980 different handwritten amounts, it is shown that these measures define a variability space of non-uniform density. A fuzzy partition of the set of 3788 words of the database is proposed which allows to regroup handwriting styles into a small number of specific families."

After preprocessing, a word image is segmented into letters or pseudoletters and represented by two feature sequences of equal length, each consisting of an alternating sequence of shape-symbols and segmentation-symbols, which are both explicitly modeled. The word model is made up of the concatenation of appropriate letter models consisting of elementary HMMs and an HMM-based interpolation technique is used to optimally combine the two feature sets. Two rejection mechanisms are considered depending on whether or not the word image is guaranteed to belong to the lexicon. Experiments carried out on real-life data show that the proposed approach can be successfully used for handwritten word recognition."

This algorithm operates on a pre-segmented word image and yields the optimum concatenation of the image segments for each word in the lexicon. However, the computational complexity of this algorithm is quite high, as the optimum concatenation is required for every word in the lexicon. In the lexicon free word matching process, the character likelihood for all the letters are calculated and the maximum likelihood value and the associated letter are determined. In this approach an optimum string results from the concatenation process. The word matching process is applied only once for an input word image. Comparative results with regard to accuracy, speed and size of lexicon are presented."

In order to compensate for this behaviour, several choices of the HWR must be initially considered. In the case of handwritten sentence/phrase recognition, linguistic constraints may be applied in order to improve the results of the HWR. This paper discusses two statistical methods of applying syntactic constraints to the output of an HWR on input consisting of sentences/phrases. Both methods are based on syntactic categories (tags) associated with words. The rst is a purely statistical method, the second is a hybrid method which combines higher-level syntactic information (hypertags) with statistical information regarding transitions between hypertags."

Such databases currently exist, but none of them gives access to the online data (pen trajectory) and offline data (digital images) for the same writing signal. We have developed such a dual on/off database, named IRONOFF. Currently, it contains a large number of isolated characters, digits, and cursive words written by French writers. We have designed this database so that, given an online point, it can be mapped at the correct location in the corresponding scanned image, and conversely, each offline pixel can be temporally indexed. Since we think this database is of interest for a large part of the research community, it is publicly available."

Both the online case (which pertains to the availability of trajectory data during writing) and the off-line case (which pertains to scanned images) are considered. Algorithms for preprocessing, character and word recognition, and performance with practical systems are indicated. Other fields of application, like signature verification, writer authentification, handwriting learning tools are also considered."

Previously, researchers trained lexicon-driven handwritten word recognition systems at the character level individually. These systems generally use statistical or neural based character recognizers to produce character level confidence scores. In the case of neural networks, the objective functions used in training involve minimizing the difference between some desired outputs and the actual outputs of the network. Desired outputs are generally not directly tied to word recognition performance. In this paper, we describe methods to optimize the parameters of these networks using word level optimization criteria. Experimental results show that word level discriminative training without desired outputs not only outperforms character level training but also eliminates the difficulty of choosing desired outputs. The method can also be applied to all segmentation based handwritten word recognition systems."

The system is used to verify handwritten street names automatically extracted from live US mail against recognition results of analytical classifiers. Presented with a binary image of a street name and an ASCII street name, holistic features (reference lines, large gaps and local contour extrema) of the street name hypothesis are \"predicted\" from the expected features of the constituent characters using heuristic rules. A dynamic programming algorithm is used to match the predicted features with the extracted image features. Classes of holistic features are matched sequentially in increasing order of cost, allowing an ACCEPT/REJECT decision to be arrived at in a time-efficient manner. The system rejects errors with 98 percent accuracy at the 30 percent accept level, while consuming approximately 20/msec per image on the average on a 150 MHz SPARC 10."

Some of the discrimination techniques, particularly those with few classes, lend themselves well to neural network classification, while others are better handled by Bayesian polynomial and nearest-neighbor methods.

This algorithm is part of the A2iA INTERCHEQUE recognition system. The algorithm starts from images of handwritten words which have been automatically segmented from binary check images. After finding the lower-case zone on the complete amount, words are slant corrected and then segmented into graphemes. Then, features are extracted from the graphemes, and the feature vectors are vector quantized resulting in a sequence of symbols for each word. Likelihoods of all word classes are computed by a set of HMMs, which have been previously trained using either the Viterbi algorithm or the Baum?Welch algorithm. The various parameters of the system have been identified and their importance evaluated. Results have been obtained on large real-life data bases of French handwritten checks. The HMM-based system has been shown to outperform a holistic word recognizer and another HMM-type word recognizer from the A2iA INTERCHEQUE recognition system. Word recognition rates of about 89% for the 26-word vocabulary relevant for legal amount recognition on French bank checks have been obtained. More recently, a Neural Network?HMM hybrid has been designed, which produces even better recognition rates."

Hidden Markov models (HMM) have been widely and successfully used in speech processing and recognition. Recently HMM has also been used with some success in recognizing handwritten words with presegmented letters. In this paper, a complete scheme for totally unconstrained handwritten word recognition based on a single contextual hidden Markov model type stochastic network is presented. Our scheme includes a morphology and heuristics based segmentation algorithm, a training algorithm that can adapt itself with the changing dictionary, and a modified Viterbi algorithm which searches for the (l+1)th globally best path based on the previous l best paths. Detailed experiments are carried out and successful recognition results are reported. >"

The operation of attempting to decompose the image into classifiable units on the basis of general image features is called \"dissection\". The second class of methods avoids dissection, and segments the image either explicitly, by classification of specified windows, or implicitly by classification of subsets of spatial features collected from the image as a whole. The third strategy is a hybrid of the first two, employing dissection together with recombination rules to define potential segments, but using classification to select from the range of admissible segmentation possibilities offered by these subimages. Finally, holistic approaches that avoid segmentation by recognizing entire character strings as units are described."

The text is not only an image, it has a proper orientation and we think that the inner structure of each text must be taken into account, that is to say the lines of the text are important. The parameters presented rely on the extraction of text lines and on the definition of upper and lower profiles. We show that a measurement of the evolution of the behavior of some characteristics of these profiles, when observation scales are modified, allows a quantification of different aspects of the handwriting. These new parameters are then interpreted and the link with some physical properties often present in handwriting is shown, such as the presence of loops or sloping of the writing."

The model used is based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM). The lines are firstly preprocessed, then segmented and characterized by two types of features. We create a HMM for each street name by simply concatenating the corresponding letter models, elementary HMM learned on a large city name database. A street name may often be surrounded by other information on the left and on the right within the delivery line. These phenomena are roughly modelled by trigrams. The global model is then simply obtained by the concatenation of trigram models with the HMMs corresponding to street names."

The encoding algorithm (programmed in APL) uses empirically determined confusion matrices to activate units in both an alphabetum and a lexicon. In general, predicted performance is enhanced when decisions are based on lexical information, because activity in the lexicon tends to constrain the identity of test letters more than the activity in the alphabetum. Thus, the model predicts large advantages of words over irregular nonwords, and smaller advantages of words over regular nonwords. The predicted differences are close to those obtained in a number of experiments and clearly demonstrate that the effects of manipulating lexicality and orthography can be predicted on the basis of lexical constraint alone. Furthermore, within each class (word, regular nonword, irregular nonword) there are significant correlations between the simulated and obtained performance on individual items. Our activation-verification model is contrasted with McClelland and Rumelhart's (1981) interactive activation model."

We focus our description on the steps where we developed and applied new techniques. These are the reading of the legal amount and the cross-validation of the recognition results for the legal and courtesy amount. In our work we deal with German cheque amounts. The reading of German legal amounts is a special challenge, since the literal words the legal amount is constructed of are usually completely connected. For the cross-validation step, we present a well structured combination strategy that allows detecting and correcting recognition errors for the legal and courtesy amount and leads to a significant increase in the system performance. Our system was tested on a database with real cheques from Swiss postal services."

A full exploitation of the contextual knowledge, together with a multi-expert approach, have been used both to analyze the complex shape of handwritten text and to design the system. Several processing modules have been integrated in the system. Some of the most relevant are those for data acquisition, preprocessing, machine-printed numeral recognition, layout analysis, courtesy amount recognition, legal amount recognition, amount validation, and signature verification. Some combination techniques have also been used in the system. Reuse and maintenance of the system were two of the main goals of the designing process and the Khoros software tool was used for this purpose."

Only recently, several researchers in off-line handwriting recognition have tried to transpose the HMM technology to their field after realizing that word images could be assimilated to sequences of observations. HMM\u2019s form a family of tools for modelling sequential processes in a statistical and generative manner. Their reputation is due to the results attained in speech recognition which derive mostly from the existence of automatic training techniques and the advantages of the probabilistic framework. This article first reviews the basic concepts of HMM\u2019s. The second part is devoted to illustrative applications in the field of off- line handwriting recognition. We describe four different applications of HMM\u2019s in various contexts and review some of the other approaches."

Very high volumes of mail in the United States mean that slight changes in mail piece finalization and error rates have substantial cost consequences. Thus, high measurement precision and carefully truthed data are required. Because of considerable regional and seasonal variability in address quality, the HIP evaluation required large, representative databases of images and confirmation using high volumes of live\u00admail. At least four RCR versions were evaluated in HIP. In comparison to a baseline RCR system, the final HIP RCR system achieved the considerable gain of approximately 33 percent in the finalization rate for an image database, while reducing the error rate to about 2.5 percent. Live\u00admail measurements from 25 diverse sites corroborated the database results and illustrated the high variability in address quality and consequent recognition performance. USPS 'testing confirmed that evaluation with sufficiently large and representative databases is an effective means for predicting performance on live\u00admail"

Ss named 96 low-frequency exception words categorized into 5 conditions on the basis of the position (1st through 5th) of their 1st irregular grapheme-to-phoneme correspondence (GPC). Latencies and error rates for these words were compared with the rates for 96 matched GPC regular controls. Results showed that the cost of irregularity decreased monotonically over the 5 positions of irregularity.

However the method can usually gives good estimate of the word slant simply, the slant tends to be underestimated when the absolute of the slant is close or greater than 45o. To solve the problem, we propose an 8-directional method which can suppress the underestimate and improves the accuracy of the slant estimation effectively without sacrificing the processing speed and the simplicity. The relationship between the slant estimation accuracy and the directional refinement of the chain code is also discussed. Although the range of linear estimation is extended widely with the increase of directional resolution, the slant tends to be overestimated. However, we find if we neglect the chain elements close to the horizontal line, the overestimate can be suppressed properly."

As a function of constraint length the performance of optimal convolutional codes is shown to be superior to that of block codes of the same length, the relative improvement increasing with rate.
