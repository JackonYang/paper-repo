Our measure (CDM) takes into account the local distribution of the vectors and iteratively estimates distance correcting terms. These terms are subsequently used to update an existing distance, thereby modifying the neighborhood structure. Experimental results on the Nister-Stewenius dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy. Our efficient search structure for visual word vectors is a two-level scheme using inverted files. The first level partitions the image set into clusters of images. At query time, only a subset of clusters of the second level has to be searched. This method allows fast querying in large sets of images. We evaluate the gain in speed and the loss in accuracy on large datasets (up to 500k images)."

We adopt the bag-of-visual-words architecture which has proven successful in achieving high precision at low recall. Unfortunately, feature detection and quantization are noisy processes and this can result in variation in the particular visual words that appear in different images of the same object, leading to missed results. In the text retrieval literature a standard method for improving performance is query expansion. A number of the highly ranked documents from the original query are reissued as a new query. In this way, additional relevant terms can be added to the query. This is a form of blind rele- vance feedback and it can fail if 'outlier' (false positive) documents are included in the reissued query. In this paper we bring query expansion into the visual domain via two novel contributions. Firstly, strong spatial constraints between the query image and each result allow us to accurately verify each return, suppressing the false positives which typically ruin text-based query expansion. Secondly, the verified images can be used to learn a latent feature model to enable the controlled construction of expanded queries. We illustrate these ideas on the 5000 annotated image Oxford building database together with more than 1M Flickr images. We show that the precision is substantially boosted, achieving total recall in many cases."

The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. The result is that retrieved is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of Google. The method is illustrated for matching in two full length feature films."

The user supplies a query object by selecting a region of a query image, and the system returns a ranked list of images that contain the same object, retrieved from a large corpus. We demonstrate the scalability and performance of our system on a dataset of over 1 million images crawled from the photo-sharing site, Flickr [3], using Oxford landmarks as queries. Building an image-feature vocabulary is a major time and performance bottleneck, due to the size of our dataset. To address this problem we compare different scalable methods for building a vocabulary and introduce a novel quantization method based on randomized trees which we show outperforms the current state-of-the-art on an extensive ground-truth. Our experiments show that the quantization has a major effect on retrieval quality. To further improve query performance, we add an efficient spatial verification stage to re-rank the results returned from our bag-of-words model and show that this consistently improves search quality, though by less of a margin when the visual vocabulary is large. We view this work as a promising step towards much larger, \"web-scale \" image corpora."

A key component of these approaches is that local regions of images are characterized using high-dimensional descriptors which are then mapped to ldquovisual wordsrdquo selected from a discrete vocabulary.This paper explores techniques to map each visual region to a weighted set of words, allowing the inclusion of features which were lost in the quantization stage of previous systems. The set of visual words is obtained by selecting words based on proximity in descriptor space. We describe how this representation may be incorporated into a standard tf-idf architecture, and how spatial verification is modified in the case of this soft-assignment. We evaluate our method on the standard Oxford Buildings dataset, and introduce a new dataset for evaluation. Our results exceed the current state of the art retrieval performance on these datasets, particularly on queries with poor initial recall where techniques like query expansion suffer. Overall we show that soft-assignment is always beneficial for retrieval with large vocabularies, at a cost of increased storage requirements for the index."

Moreover, automatic data-mining techniques like clustering of news streams into topical groups can fully recover the underlying true class labels of data if and only if all classes are well separated. In reality, especially for news streams, this is clearly not the case. The question to ask is thus this: if we cannot recover the full C classes by clustering, what is the largest K < C clusters we can find that best resemble the K underlying classes? Using the intuition that bursty topics are more likely to correspond to important events that are of interest to analysts, we propose several new bursty vector space models (B-VSM)for representing a news document. B-VSM takes into account the burstiness (across the full corpus and whole duration) of each constituent word in a document at the time of publication. We benchmarked our B-VSM against the classical TFIDF-VSM on the task of clustering a collection of news stream articles with known topic labels. Experimental results show that B-VSM was able to find the burstiest clusters/topics. Further, it also significantly improved the recall and precision for the top K clusters/topics."

What is correlated across images (or across video sequences) is the internal layout of local self-similarities (up to some distortions), even though the patterns generating those local self-similarities are quite different in each of the images/videos. These internal self-similarities are efficiently captured by a compact local \"self-similarity descriptor\"', measured densely throughout the image/video, at multiple scales, while accounting for local and global geometric distortions. This gives rise to matching capabilities of complex visual data, including detection of objects in real cluttered images using only rough hand-sketches, handling textured objects with no clear boundaries, and detecting complex actions in cluttered video data with no prior learning. We compare our measure to commonly used image-based and video-based similarity measures, and demonstrate its applicability to object detection, retrieval, and action detection."

The efficiency and quality is exhibited in a live demonstration that recognizes CD-covers from a database of 40000 images of popular music CD\u2019s. The scheme builds upon popular techniques of indexing descriptors extracted from local regions, and is robust to background clutter and occlusion. The local region descriptors are hierarchically quantized in a vocabulary tree. The vocabulary tree allows a larger and more discriminatory vocabulary to be used efficiently, which we show experimentally leads to a dramatic improvement in retrieval quality. The most significant property of the scheme is that the tree directly defines the quantization. The quantization and the indexing are therefore fully integrated, essentially being one and the same. The recognition quality is evaluated through retrieval on a database with ground truth, showing the power of the vocabulary tree approach, going as high as 1 million images."

However, they do not capture well the phenomenon that words in a document tend to appear in bursts: if a word appears once, it is more likely to appear again. In this paper, we propose the Dirichlet compound multinomial model (DCM) as an alternative to the multinomial. The DCM model has one additional degree of freedom, which allows it to capture burstiness. We show experimentally that the DCM is substantially better than the multinomial at modeling text data, measured by perplexity. We also show using three standard document collections that the DCM leads to better classification than the multinomial model. DCM performance is comparable to that obtained with multiple heuristic changes to the multinomial model."

                "text": "Shannon (1948) showed that a wide range of practical problems can be reduced to the problem of estimating probability distributions of words and ngrams in text. It has become standard practice in text compression, speech recognition, information retrieval and many other applications of Shannon\u2019s theory to introduce a \u2018\u2018bag-of-words\u2019\u2019 assumption. But obviously, word rates vary from genre to genre, author to author, topic to topic, document to document, section to section, and paragraph to paragraph. The proposed Poisson mixture captures much of this heterogeneous structure by allowing the Poisson parameter \u03b8 to vary over documents subject to a density function \u03c6. \u03c6 is intended to capture dependencies on hidden variables such genre, author, topic, etc. (The Negative Binomial is a well-known special case where \u03c6 is a \u0393 distribution.) Poisson mixtures fit the data better than standard Poissons, producing more accurate estimates of the variance over documents (\u03c3), entropy (H), inverse document frequency (IDF), and adaptation (Pr(x \u2265 2\uf8f4x \u2265 1 )). 1. Problem: Word Rates Are Highly Variable Many applications of statistical natural language processing make use of a so-called \u2018\u2018bag-of-words\u2019\u2019 assumption. Of course, is well known that word rates depend on many factors: genre, author, topic, etc. Table 1, for example, shows that \u2018\u2018said\u2019\u2019 is more frequent in some types of texts and less frequent in others.

The corpus consists of 500 excerpts of approximately 2000 words each, selected from a wide variety of genres: Press (documents 1-88), Religion (89-105), Hobbies (106-141), Popular Lore (142-189), Belle-Lettres (190-264), Government and House Organs (265-294), Learned (295-374), Fiction (375-491), and Humor (492-500).

We, first, analyze bag-of-features in the framework of approximate nearest neighbor search. This shows the sub-optimality of such a representation for matching descriptors and leads us to derive a more precise representation based on 1) Hamming embedding (HE) and 2) weak geometric consistency constraints (WGC). HE provides binary signatures that refine the matching based on visual words. WGC filters matching descriptors that are not consistent in terms of angle and scale. HE and WGC are integrated within the inverted file and are efficiently exploited for all images, even in the case of very large datasets. Experiments performed on a dataset of one million of images show a significant improvement due to the binary signature and the weak geometric consistency constraints, as well as their efficiency. Estimation of the full geometric transformation, i.e., a re-ranking step on a short list of images, is complementary to our weak geometric consistency constraints and allows to further improve the accuracy."

The existing models for word distribution present observed sequences of words in text documents as an outcome of some stochastic processes; the corresponding distributions of numbers of word occurrences in the documents are modelled as mixtures of Poisson distributions whose parameter values are fitted to the data. We pursue a linguistically motivated approach to statistical language modelling and use observable text characteristics as model parameters. Multi-word technical terms, intrinsically content entities, are chosen for experimentation. Their occurrence and the occurrence dynamics are investigated using a 100-million word data collection consisting of a variety of about 13,000 technical documents. The derivation of models describing word distribution in text is based on a linguistic interpretation of the process of text formation, with the probabilities of word occurrence being functions of observable and linguistically meaningful text characteristics. The adequacy of the proposed models for the description of actually observed distributions of words and phrases in text is confirmed experimentally. The paper has two focuses: one is modelling of the distributions of content words and phrases among different documents; and another is word occurrence dynamics within documents and estimation of corresponding probabilities. Accordingly, among the application areas for the new modelling paradigm are information retrieval and speech recognition."

A dynamic NRT is an NRT under motion. Although NRTs are pervasive in man-made and natural environments, effective computational algorithms for NRTs are few. This paper addresses specific computational challenges in modeling and tracking dynamic NRTs, including ambiguous correspondences, occlusions, and drastic illumination and appearance variations. We propose a lattice-based Markov-random-field (MRF) model for dynamic NRTs in a 3D spatiotemporal space. Our model consists of a global lattice structure that characterizes the topological constraint among multiple textons and an image observation model that handles local geometry and appearance variations. Based on the proposed MRF model, we develop a tracking algorithm that utilizes belief propagation and particle filtering to effectively handle the special challenges of the dynamic NRT tracking without any assumption on the motion types or lighting conditions. We provide quantitative evaluations of the proposed method against existing tracking algorithms and demonstrate its applications in video editing"

The method is based on two recent results on scale space: (1) Interest points can be adapted to scale and give repeatable results (geometrically stable). (2) Local extrema over scale of normalized derivatives indicate the presence of characteristic local structures. Our method first computes a multi-scale representation for the Harris interest point detector. We then select points at which a local measure (the Laplacian) is maximal over scales. This allows a selection of distinctive points for which the characteristic scale is known. These points are invariant to scale, rotation and translation as well as robust to illumination changes and limited changes of viewpoint. For indexing, the image is characterized by a set of scale invariant points; the scale associated with each point allows the computation of a scale invariant descriptor. Our descriptors are, in addition, invariant to image rotation, of affine illumination changes and robust to small perspective deformations. Experimental results for indexing show an excellent performance up to a scale factor of 4 for a database with more than 5000 images."

Our scale and affine invariant detectors are based on the following recent results: (1) Interest points extracted with the Harris detector can be adapted to affine transformations and give repeatable results (geometrically stable). (2) The characteristic scale of a local structure is indicated by a local extremum over scale of normalized derivatives (the Laplacian). (3) The affine shape of a point neighborhood is estimated based on the second moment matrix.Our scale invariant detector computes a multi-scale representation for the Harris interest point detector and then selects points at which a local measure (the Laplacian) is maximal over scales. This provides a set of distinctive points which are invariant to scale, rotation and translation as well as robust to illumination changes and limited changes of viewpoint. The characteristic scale determines a scale invariant region for each point. We extend the scale invariant detector to affine invariance by estimating the affine shape of a point neighborhood. An iterative algorithm modifies location, scale and neighborhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. This method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. The characteristic scale and the affine shape of neighborhood determine an affine invariant region for each point.We present a comparative evaluation of different detectors and show that our approach provides better results than existing methods. The performance of our detector is also confirmed by excellent matching results; the image is described by a set of scale/affine invariant descriptors computed on the regions associated with our points."
