The procedure is based on a very low dimensional representation of the scene, that we term the Spatial Envelope. We propose a set of perceptual dimensions (naturalness, openness, roughness, expansion, ruggedness) that represent the dominant spatial structure of a scene. Then, we show that these dimensions may be reliably estimated using spectral and coarsely localized information. The model generates a multidimensional space in which scenes sharing membership in semantic categories (e.g., streets, highways, coasts) are projected closed together. The performance of the spatial envelope model shows that specific information about object shape or identity is not a requirement for scene categorization and that modeling a holistic representation of the scene informs about its probable semantic category."

We observe that most indoor and outdoor (city) scenes are designed on a Manhattan three-dimensional grid. This Manhattan grid structure puts strong constraints on the intensity gradients in the image. We demonstrate an algorithm for detecting the orientation of the user in such scenes based on Bayesian inference using statistics which we have learnt in this domain. Our algorithm requires a single input image and does not involve pre-processing stages such as edge detection and Hough grouping. We demonstrate strong experimental results on a range of indoor and outdoor images. We also show that estimating the grid structure makes it significantly easier to detect target objects which are not aligned with the grid."

We consider 3D bilaterally symmetric objects, that is, objects which are symmetric with respect to a plane (e.g., faces), and their reconstruction from a single image. Both the viewpoint and the illumination are not necessarily frontal. Furthermore, no correspondence between symmetric points is required.The basic idea is that an image taken from a general, non frontal viewpoint, under non-frontal illumination can be regarded as a pair of images. Each image of the pair is one half of the object, taken from different viewing positions and with different lighting directions. Thus, one-image-variants of geometric stereo and of photometric stereo can be used. Unlike the separate invocation of these approaches, which require point correspondence between the two images, we show that integrating the photometric and geometric information suffice to yield a dense correspondence between pairs of symmetric points, and as a result, a dense shape recovery of the object. Furthermore, the unknown lighting and viewing parameters, are also recovered in this process.Unknown distant point light source, Lambertian surfaces, unknown constant albedo, and weak perspective projection are assumed. The method has been implemented and tested experimentally on simulated and real data."

First, the use of local spatial-frequency spectra and their moments to describe texture is discussed and motivated. A new, more accurate method for measuring the local spatial-frequency moments of an image texture using Gabor elementary functions and their derivatives is presented. Also described is a technique for separating shading from texture information, which makes the shape-from-texture algorithm robust to the shading effects found in real imagery. Second, a detailed model for the projection of local spectra and spectral moments of any surface reflectance patterns (not just textures) is developed. Third, the conditions under which the projection model can be solved for the orientation of the surface at each point are explored. Unlike earlier non-feature-based, curved surface shape-from-texture approaches, the assumption that the surface texture is isotropic is not required; surface texture homogeneity can be assumed instead. The algorithm's ability to operate on anisotropic and nondeterministic textures, and on both smooth- and rough-textured surfaces, is demonstrated. >"

As such, this represents a new class of appearance based techniques for computer vision. Based on joint statistics, the paper develops techniques for the identification of multiple objects at arbitrary positions and orientations in a cluttered scene. Experiments show that these techniques can identify over 100 objects in the presence of major occlusions. Most remarkably, the techniques have low complexity and therefore run in real-time."

The results of this measure are compared with humans analyzing seven \"teaser\" images to test its effectiveness for finding perceptually dominant orientations. The use of low-level orientation is then applied to a \"quick search\" problem important in image database applications. Since both pigeons and humans are able to perform coarse classification of certain kinds of scenes, e.g., city from country, without taking time or brain-power to solve the image understanding problem, the authors conjecture that the collective behavior of low-level textural features such as orientation may be doing most of the work. The authors demonstrate a simple test of global multiscale orientation for quickly searching a database of vacation photos for likely \"city/suburb\" shots.

In this paper, we present a new image representation which provides a transformation from the raw pixel data to a small set of localized coherent regions in color and texture space. This so-called &ldquo;blobworld&rdquo; representation is based on segmentation using the expectation-maximization algorithm on combined color and texture features. The texture features we use for the segmentation arise from a new approach to texture description and scale selection. We describe a system that uses the blobworld representation to retrieve images. An important and unique aspect of the system is that, in the context of similarity-based querying, the user is allowed to view the internal representation of the submitted image and the query results. Similar systems do not offer the user this view into the workings of the system; consequently, the outcome of many queries on these systems can be quite inexplicable, despite the availability of knobs for adjusting the similarity metric"

We demonstrate that performance is improved by computing features on subblocks, classifying these subblocks, and then combining these results in a way reminiscent of stacking. State of the art single-feature methods are shown to result in about 75-86% performance, while the new method results in 90.3% correct classification, when evaluated on a diverse database of over 1300 consumer images provided by Kodak."

Here it is postulated that the visual system is sensitive to the correlation in image intensity across the visual field, and that these correlations are used to help calibrate spatial representations. Since measurements made near to each other in the visual field are more correlated than measurements made at a distance, the degree of correlation can be used as an estimate of the distance between two measurements and can therefore be used to calibrate a roughly organized spatial representation. We therefore explored the hypothesis that low level spatial representations are calibrated using a signal based on image intensity correlation. If the visual system uses input statistics to calibrate its spatial representation, then any distortions and anisotropies in these input statistics should be mirrored by distortions in the representation of space. To test the psychological implications of this hypothesis, a collection of 81 images of open and urban landscapes were used to estimate the degree of correlation between image intensity measurement pairs as a function of both distance and orientation. Doing this we show that a system that used the statistics measured to calibrate its representation would show: 1. (1) a horizontal-vertical illusion; 2. (2) the magnitude of this illusion would depend on the amount of open and urban landscapes in the environment; 3. (3) there would be a nontrivial relationship between line orientation and judged length. Analogues of all these distortions and regularities can be found in the psychophysical literature on distance estimation. This gives strength to the proposal that spatial representations are calibrated using input statistics."

To understand the representation of images by the mammalian visual system, it might therefore be useful to consider the statistics of images from the natural environment (i.e., images with trees, rocks, bushes, etc). In this study, various coding schemes are compared in relation to how they represent the information in such natural images. The coefficients of such codes are represented by arrays of mechanisms that respond to local regions of space, spatial frequency, and orientation (Gabor-like transforms). For many classes of image, such codes will not be an efficient means of representing information. However, the results obtained with six natural images suggest that the orientation and the spatial-frequency tuning of mammalian simple cells are well suited for coding the information in such images if the goal of the code is to convert higher-order redundancy (e.g., correlation between the intensities of neighboring pixels) into first-order redundancy (i.e., the response distribution of the coefficients). Such coding produces a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio and permits information to be transmitted with only a subset of the total number of cells. These results support Barlow's theory that the goal of natural vision is to represent the information in the natural environment with minimal redundancy."

Knowing the context of a scene, a retrieval system may compute its semantic category in advance and filter out scenes belonging to irrelevant classes. \n \nIn this paper, we introduce a computational approach which classifies and organises real-world scenes along broad semantic axes. Fundamental to our approach is the computation of global spectral templates providing a continuous organisation of scenes between two categories. These templates encode the structure which is discriminant between two categories. We propose a hierarchical procedure of two stages, that organises images along three semantic axis. Firstly, all the scenes are classified according to an Artificial to Natural axis. Then, natural scenes are organised along the Open to Closed axis whereas artificial environments are classified according to the Expanded to Enclosed scenes axis."

This theory combines filtering theory and Markov random field modeling through the maximum entropy principle, and interprets and clarifies many previous concepts and methods for texture analysis and synthesis from a unified point of view. Our theory characterizes the ensemble of images I with the same texture appearance by a probability distribution f(I) on a random field, and the objective of texture modeling is to make inference about f(I), given a set of observed texture examples.In our theory, texture modeling consists of two steps. (1) A set of filters is selected from a general filter bank to capture features of the texture, these filters are applied to observed texture images, and the histograms of the filtered images are extracted. These histograms are estimates of the marginal distributions of f( I). This step is called feature extraction. (2) The maximum entropy principle is employed to derive a distribution p(I), which is restricted to have the same marginal distributions as those in (1). This p(I) is considered as an estimate of f( I). This step is called feature fusion. A stepwise algorithm is proposed to choose filters from a general filter bank. The resulting model, called FRAME (Filters, Random fields And Maximum Entropy), is a Markov random field (MRF) model, but with a much enriched vocabulary and hence much stronger descriptive ability than the previous MRF models used for texture modeling. Gibbs sampler is adopted to synthesize texture images by drawing typical samples from p(I), thus the model is verified by seeing whether the synthesized texture images have similar visual appearances to the texture images being modeled. Experiments on a variety of 1D and 2D textures are described to illustrate our theory and to show the performance of our algorithms. These experiments demonstrate that many textures which are previously considered as from different categories can be modeled and synthesized in a common framework."

In this image a rectangular areacomposed of small X-shaped patterns appears as a distinctregion against a background of L-shaped patterns. Thissegregation occurs rapidly and unconsciously, without effort or search. The rectangular area composed of T- shaped patterns, however, does not appear as a distinct region in this sense. It is very easy to discriminate amongall three pattems, but only the X and L regions displayspontaneous segregation. This distinction between pat- tern discrimination and perceptual segregation gives par-ticular interest to the study of this aspect of visual textureperception. Other aspects of texture perception include the role of texture in the perception of surface orientation and shape and the influence of surface texture in de-termining color appearance. In this paper we limit con-sideration to the phenomenon of segregation.Pure texture-based segregation is not a very importantphenomenon in everyday visual experience. Objects are not usually distinguished from their backgrounds purely by textural differences. In this respect, the study of puretexture differences (in the absence of differences in bright-ness, color, depth, or other properties) is analogous to thestudy of isoluminant color differences, which also are notvery common in natural scenes. The relative rarity ofisoluminant color discrimination in the real world does not imply that color perception is an unimportant compo-nent of seeing. Similarly, the rarity of pure texture differ-ences does not reduce the potential importance of textureperception, especially in the visual processing of complexscenes."

In applications such as database retrieval, it is important that image features used in pattern comparison provide good measures of image perceptual similarities. We present an image model with a new set of features that address the challenge of perceptual similarity. The model is based on the 2D Wold decomposition of homogeneous random fields. The three resulting mutually orthogonal subfields have perceptual properties which can be described as \"periodicity,\" \"directionality,\" and \"randomness,\" approximating what are indicated to be the three most important dimensions of human texture perception. The method presented improves upon earlier Wold-based models in its tolerance to a variety of local inhomogeneities which arise in natural textures and its invariance under image transformation such as rotation. An image retrieval algorithm based on the new texture model is presented. Different types of image features are aggregated for similarity comparison by using a Bayesian probabilistic approach. The, effectiveness of the Wold model at retrieving perceptually similar natural textures is demonstrated in comparison to that of two other well-known pattern recognition methods. The Wold model appears to offer a perceptually more satisfying measure of pattern similarity while exceeding the performance of these other methods by traditional pattern recognition criteria. Examples of natural scene Wold texture modeling are also presented."

The model is parameterized by a set of statistics computed on pairs of coefficients corresponding to basis functions at adjacent spatial locations, orientations, and scales. We develop an efficient algorithm for synthesizing random images subject to these constraints, by iteratively projecting onto the set of images satisfying each constraint, and we use this to test the perceptual validity of the model. In particular, we demonstrate the necessity of subgroups of the parameter set by showing examples of texture synthesis that fail when those parameters are removed from the set. We also demonstrate the power of our model by successfully synthesizing examples drawn from a diverse collection of artificial and natural textures."

This synthesis is completely automatic and requires only the \u201ctarget\u201d texture as input. It allows generation of as much texture as desired so that any object can be covered. It can be used to produce solid textures for creating textured 3-d objects without the distortions inherent in texture mapping. It can also be used to synthesize texture mixtures, images that look a bit like each of several digitized samples. The approach is based on a model of human texture perception, and has potential to be a practically useful tool for graphics applications."

                "text": "The fact that objects in the world appear in different ways depending on the scale of observation has important implications if one aims at describing them. It shows that the notion of scale is of utmost importance when processing unknown measurement data by automatic methods. In their seminal works, Witkin (1983) and Koenderink (1984) proposed to approach this problem by representing image structures at different scales in a so-called scale-space representation. Traditional scale-space theory building on this work, however, does not address the problem of how to select local appropriate scales for further analysis. This article proposes a systematic methodology for dealing with this problem. A framework is presented for generating hypotheses about interesting scale levels in image data, based on a general principle stating that local extrema over scales of different combinations of \u03b3-normalized derivatives are likely candidates to correspond to interesting structures. Specifically, it is shown how this idea can be used as a major mechanism in algorithms for automatic scale selection, which adapt the local scales of processing to the local image structure.Support for the proposed approach is given in terms of a general theoretical investigation of the behaviour of the scale selection method under rescalings of the input pattern and by integration with different types of early visual modules, including experiments on real-world and synthetic data. Support is also given by a detailed analysis of how different types of feature detectors perform when integrated with a scale selection mechanism and then applied to characteristic model patterns. Specifically, it is described in detail how the proposed methodology applies to the problems of blob detection, junction detection, edge detection, ridge detection and local frequency estimation.In many computer vision applications, the poor performance of the low-level vision modules constitutes a major bottleneck. It is argued that the inclusion of mechanisms for automatic scale selection is essential if we are to construct vision systems to automatically analyse complex unknown environments."

One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding7\u201312. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties13\u201318, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal8,12 that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs."

A series of probabilistic models for power spectra enabled calculating the information obtained from prior knowledge of parameters describing spectra. Most information is gained from contrast, 1/f2 spatial frequency behaviour, and contrast as a function of orientation. Variations in spatial frequency behaviour are relatively unimportant. For oriented contrast, a bandwidth of 10-30 deg is sufficient to obtain most information."

To do so, we have conducted two psychophysical scaling experiments and have compared the results to two algorithmic image similarity metrics. For these experiments, we selected a set of 97 digitized photographic images which represent a range of semantic categories, viewing distances, and colors. We then used the two perceptual and the two algorithmic methods to measure the similarity of each image to every other image in the data set, producing four similarity matrices. These matrices were analyzed using multidimensional scaling techniques to gain insight into the dimensions human observers use for judging image similarity, and how these dimensions differ from the results of algorithmic methods. This paper also describes and validates a new technique for collecting similarity judgments which can provide meaningful results with a factor of four fewer judgments, as compared with the paired comparisons method."

To solve these problems, we must be able to relate natural surfaces to their images; this requires a good model of natural surface shapes. Fractal functions are a good choice for modeling 3-D natural surfaces because 1) many physical processes produce a fractal surface shape, 2) fractals are widely used as a graphics tool for generating natural-looking shapes, and 3) a survey of natural imagery has shown that the 3-D fractal surface model, transformed by the image formation process, furnishes an accurate description of both textured and shaded image regions. The 3-D fractal model provides a characterization of 3-D surfaces and their images for which the appropriateness of the model is verifiable. Furthermore, this characterization is stable over transformations of scale and linear transforms of intensity. The 3-D fractal model has been successfully applied to the problems of 1) texture segmentation and classification, 2) estimation of 3-D shape information, and 3) distinguishing between perceptually ``smooth'' and perceptually ``textured'' surfaces in the scene."

In this paper, we exploit the power of fractal geometry to generate global characteristics of natural scenes. In particular we are concerned with the following two questions: 1) Can we develop a measure which can distinguish between different global backgrounds (e.g., mountains and trees)? and 2) Can we develop a measure that is sensitive to change in distance (or scale)? We present a model based on fractional Brownian motion which will allow us to recover two characteristics related to the fractal dimension from silhouettes. The first characteristic is an estimate of the fractal dimension based on a least squares linear fit. We show that this feature is stable under a variety of real image conditions and use it to distinguish silhouettes of trees from silhouettes of mountains. Next we introduce a new theoretical concept called the average Holder constant and relate it mathematically to the fractal dimension. It is shown that this measurement is sensitive to scale in a predictable manner, and hence, provides the potential for use as a range indicator. Corroborating experimental results are presented."
