This requires a representation above the level of pixels that can be endowed with high-level attributes such as class of object/region, its orientation, and (rough 3D) location within the scene. Towards this goal, we propose a region-based model which combines appearance and scene geometry to automatically decompose a scene into semantically meaningful regions. Our model is defined in terms of a unified energy function over scene appearance and structure. We show how this energy function can be learned from data and present an efficient inference technique that makes use of multiple over-segmentations of the image to propose moves in the energy-space. We show, experimentally, that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the tasks of both multi-class image segmentation and geometric reasoning. Finally, by understanding region classes and geometry, we show how our model can be used as the basis for 3D reconstruction of the scene."

This requires solving several sub-problems simultaneously, including object detection, region labeling, and geometric reasoning. The last few decades have seen great progress in tackling each of these problems in isolation. Only recently have researchers returned to the difficult task of considering them jointly. In this work, we consider learning a set of related models in such that they both solve their own problem and help each other. We develop a framework called Cascaded Classification Models (CCM), where repeated instantiations of these classifiers are coupled by their input/output variables in a cascade that improves performance at each level. Our method requires only a limited \"black box\" interface with the models, allowing us to use very sophisticated, state-of-the-art classifiers without having to look under the hood. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a large set of natural images by combining the subtasks of scene categorization, object detection, multiclass image segmentation, and 3d reconstruction."

In Bayesian image analysis, this requires fusing together local predictions for the class labels with a prior model of label images. Following the work of Bouman and Shapiro (1994), we consider the use of tree-structured belief networks (TSBNs) as prior models. The parameters in the TSBN are trained using a maximum-likelihood objective function with the EM algorithm and the resulting model is evaluated by calculating how efficiently it codes label images. A number of authors have used Gaussian mixture models to connect the label field to the image data. We compare this approach to the scaled-likelihood method of Smyth (1994) and Morgan and Bourlard (1995), where local predictions of pixel classification from neural networks are fused with the TSBN prior. Our results show a higher performance is obtained with the neural networks. We evaluate the classification results obtained and emphasize not only the maximum a posteriori segmentation, but also the uncertainty, as evidenced e.g., by the pixelwise posterior marginal entropies. We also investigate the use of conditional maximum-likelihood training for the TSBN and find that this gives rise to improved classification performance over the ML-trained TSBN."

It is well known that each quantisation has its fair share of pros and cons; and the existence of a common optimal quantisation level suitable for all object categories is highly unlikely. Motivated by this observation, we propose a hierarchical random field model, that allows integration of features computed at different levels of the quantisation hierarchy. MAP inference in this model can be performed efficiently using powerful graph cut based move making algorithms. Our framework generalises much of the previous work based on pixels or segments. We evaluate its efficiency on some of the most challenging data-sets for object class segmentation, and show it obtains state-of-the-art results."

Specifically, we first propose to employ Conditional Random Field (CRF) to model the spatial relationships among image superpixel regions and their measurements. We then introduce a multilayer Bayesian Network (BN) to model the causal dependencies that naturally exist among different image entities, including image regions, edges, and vertices. The CRF model and the BN model are then systematically and seamlessly combined through the theories of Factor Graph to form a unified probabilistic graphical model that captures the complex relationships among different image entities. Using the unified graphical model, image segmentation can be performed through a principled probabilistic inference. Experimental results on the Weizmann horse data set, on the VOC2006 cow data set, and on the MSRC2 multiclass data set demonstrate that our approach achieves favorable results compared to state-of-the-art approaches as well as those that use either the BN model or CRF model alone."

First, it encodes both the short-range interactions (e.g., pixelwise label smoothing) as well as the long-range interactions (e.g., relative configurations of objects or regions) in a tractable manner. Second, the formulation is general enough to be applied to different domains ranging from pixelwise image labeling to contextual object detection.

However, when inference is used in a learning algorithm, a good approximation of the score may not be sufficient. We show in particular that learning can fail even with an approximate inference method with rigorous approximation guarantees. There are two reasons for this. First, approximate methods can effectively reduce the expressivity of an underlying model by making it impossible to choose parameters that reliably give good predictions. Second, approximations can respond to parameter changes in such a way that standard learning algorithms are misled. In contrast, we give two positive results in the form of learning bounds for the use of LP-relaxed inference in structured perceptron and empirical risk minimization settings. We argue that without understanding combinations of inference and learning, such as these, that are appropriately compatible, learning performance under approximate inference cannot be guaranteed."

Our method is based on higher order conditional random fields and uses potentials defined on sets of pixels (image segments) generated using unsupervised segmentation algorithms. These potentials enforce label consistency in image regions and can be seen as a generalization of the commonly used pairwise contrast sensitive smoothness potentials. The higher order potential functions used in our framework take the form of the Robust Pn model and are more general than the Pn Potts model recently proposed by Kohli et al. We prove that the optimal swap and expansion moves for energy functions composed of these potentials can be computed by solving a st-mincut problem. This enables the use of powerful graph cut based move making algorithms for performing inference in the framework. We test our method on the problem of multi-class object segmentation by augmenting the conventional crf used for object segmentation with higher order potentials defined on image regions. Experiments on challenging data sets show that integration of higher order potentials quantitatively and qualitatively improves results leading to much better definition of object boundaries. We believe that this method can be used to yield similar improvements for many other labelling problems."

One important type of global feature is that of inter-class spatial relationships. For example, identifying \u201ctree\u201d pixels indicates that pixels above and to the sides are more likely to be \u201csky\u201d whereas pixels below are more likely to be \u201cgrass.\u201d Incorporating such global information across the entire image and between all classes is a computational challenge as it is image-dependent, and hence, cannot be precomputed.In this work we propose a method for capturing global information from inter-class spatial relationships and encoding it as a local feature. We employ a two-stage classification process to label all image pixels. First, we generate predictions which are used to compute a local relative location feature from learned relative location maps. In the second stage, we combine this with appearance-based features to provide a final segmentation. We compare our results to recent published results on several multi-class image segmentation databases and show that the incorporation of relative location information allows us to significantly outperform the current state-of-the-art."

We then learn the importance of different descriptors (e.g. color, texture, shape) of the ancestors for classification.

In this paper, we present an approach for approximate maximum likelihood parameter learning in discriminative field models, which is based on approximating true expectations with simple piecewise constant functions constructed using inference techniques. Gradient ascent with these updates exhibits compelling limit cycle behavior which is tied closely to the number of errors made during inference. The performance of various approximations was evaluated with different inference techniques showing that the learned parameters lead to good classification performance so long as the method used for approximating the gradient is consistent with the inference mechanism. The proposed approach is general enough to be used for the training of, e.g., smoothing parameters of conventional Markov Random Fields (MRFs)."

The learned model is used for automatic visual understanding and semantic segmentation of photographs. Our discriminative model exploits texture-layout filters, novel features based on textons, which jointly model patterns of texture and their spatial layout. Unary classification and feature selection is achieved using shared boosting to give an efficient classifier which can be applied to a large number of classes. Accurate image segmentation is achieved by incorporating the unary classifier in a conditional random field, which (i) captures the spatial interactions between class labels of neighboring pixels, and (ii) improves the segmentation of specific object instances. Efficient training of the model on large datasets is achieved by exploiting both random feature selection and piecewise training methods.\n\nHigh classification and segmentation accuracy is demonstrated on four varied databases: (i) the MSRC 21-class database containing photographs of real objects viewed under general lighting conditions, poses and viewpoints, (ii) the 7-class Corel subset and (iii) the 7-class Sowerby database used in He et\u00a0al. (Proceeding of IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, vol.\u00a02, pp.\u00a0695\u2013702, June 2004), and (iv) a set of video sequences of television shows. The proposed algorithm gives competitive and visually pleasing results for objects that are highly textured (grass, trees, etc.), highly structured (cars, faces, bicycles, airplanes, etc.), and even articulated (body, cow, etc.).\n"

                "text": "The notion of using context information for solving high-level vision and medical image segmentation problems has been increasingly realized in the field. However, how to learn an effective and efficient context model, together with an image appearance model, remains mostly unknown. The current literature using Markov Random Fields (MRFs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) often involves specific algorithm design in which the modeling and computing stages are studied in isolation. In this paper, we propose a learning algorithm, auto-context. Given a set of training images and their corresponding label maps, we first learn a classifier on local image patches. The discriminative probability (or classification confidence) maps created by the learned classifier are then used as context information, in addition to the original image patches, to train a new classifier. The algorithm then iterates until convergence. Auto-context integrates low-level and context information by fusing a large number of low-level appearance features with context and implicit shape information. The resulting discriminative algorithm is general and easy to implement. Under nearly the same parameter settings in training, we apply the algorithm to three challenging vision applications: foreground/background segregation, human body configuration estimation, and scene region labeling. Moreover, context also plays a very important role in medical/brain images where the anatomical structures are mostly constrained to relatively fixed positions. With only some slight changes resulting from using 3D instead of 2D features, the auto-context algorithm applied to brain MRI image segmentation is shown to outperform state-of-the-art algorithms specifically designed for this domain. Furthermore, the scope of the proposed algorithm goes beyond image analysis and it has the potential to be used for a wide variety of problems for structured prediction problems."

                "text": "This paper introduces a new rigorous theoretical framework to address discrete MRF-based optimization in computer vision. Such a framework exploits the powerful technique of Dual Decomposition. It is based on a projected subgradient scheme that attempts to solve an MRF optimization problem by first decomposing it into a set of appropriately chosen subproblems, and then combining their solutions in a principled way. In order to determine the limits of this method, we analyze the conditions that these subproblems have to satisfy and demonstrate the extreme generality and flexibility of such an approach. We thus show that by appropriately choosing what subproblems to use, one can design novel and very powerful MRF optimization algorithms. For instance, in this manner we are able to derive algorithms that: 1) generalize and extend state-of-the-art message-passing methods, 2) optimize very tight LP-relaxations to MRF optimization, and 3) take full advantage of the special structure that may exist in particular MRFs, allowing the use of efficient inference techniques such as, e.g., graph-cut-based methods. Theoretical analysis on the bounds related with the different algorithms derived from our framework and experimental results/comparisons using synthetic and real data for a variety of tasks in computer vision demonstrate the extreme potentials of our approach."

In experiments on eight datasets, stacked graphical learning is 40 to 80 times faster than Gibbs sampling during inference."

Although this approach performs well, it has a number of disadvantages. In particular, exact MAP estimates cannot be computed, approximate MAP estimates are computationally expensive to compute, and unsupervised parameter estimation of the MRF is difficult. The authors propose a new approach to Bayesian image segmentation that directly addresses these problems. The new method replaces the MRF model with a novel multiscale random field (MSRF) and replaces the MAP estimator with a sequential MAP (SMAP) estimator derived from a novel estimation criteria. Together, the proposed estimator and model result in a segmentation algorithm that is not iterative and can be computed in time proportional to MN where M is the number of classes and N is the number of pixels. The also develop a computationally efficient method for unsupervised estimation of model parameters. Simulations on synthetic images indicate that the new algorithm performs better and requires much less computation than MAP estimation using simulated annealing. The algorithm is also found to improve classification accuracy when applied to the segmentation of multispectral remotely sensed images with ground truth data."

Generally, the MRF/CRF model is learned independently of the inference algorithm that is used to obtain the final result. In this paper, we observe considerable gains in speed and accuracy by training the MRF/CRF model together with a fast and suboptimal inference algorithm. An active random field (ARF) is defined as a combination of a MRF/CRF based model and a fast inference algorithm for the MRF/CRF model. This combination is trained through an optimization of a loss function and a training set consisting of pairs of input images and desired outputs. We apply the ARF concept to image denoising, using the Fields of Experts MRF together with a 1-4 iteration gradient descent algorithm for inference. Experimental validation on unseen data shows that the ARF approach obtains an improved benchmark performance as well as a 1000-3000 times speedup compared to the Fields of Experts MRF. Using the ARF approach, image denoising can be performed in real-time, at 8 fps on a single CPU for a 256times256 image sequence, with close to state-of-the-art accuracy."

Detecting junctions locally has proved problematic because the image intensity surface is confusing in the neighborhood of a junction. Edge detectors also do not perform well near junctions. Current leading approaches to junction detection, such as the Harris operator, are based on 2D variation in the intensity signal. However, a drawback of this strategy is that it confuses textured regions with junctions. We believe that the right approach to junction detection should take advantage of the contours that are incident at a junction; contours themselves can be detected by processes that use more global approaches. In this paper, we develop a new high-performance contour detector using a combination of local and global cues. This contour detector provides the best performance to date (F=0.70) on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (BSDS) benchmark. From the resulting contours, we detect and localize candidate junctions, taking into account both contour salience and geometric configuration. We show that improvements in our contour model lead to better junctions. Our contour and junction detectors both provide state of the art performance."

This is not true in imitation learning as the learned policy influences the future test inputs (states) upon which it will be tested. We show that this leads to compounding errors and a regret bound that grows quadratically in the time horizon of the task. We propose two alternative algorithms for imitation learning where training occurs over several episodes of interaction. These two approaches share in common that the learner\u2019s policy is slowly modified from executing the expert\u2019s policy to the learned policy. We show that this leads to stronger performance guarantees and demonstrate the improved performance on two challenging problems: training a learner to play 1) a 3D racing game (Super Tux Kart) and 2) Mario Bros.; given input images from the games and corresponding actions taken by a human expert and near-optimal planner respectively."

Working under the restriction of limited computation, we analyze a joint method in which the same convex variational relaxation is used to construct an M-estimator for fitting parameters, and to perform approximate marginalization for the prediction step. The key result of this paper is that in the computation-limited setting, using an inconsistent parameter estimator (i.e., an estimator that returns the \"wrong\" model even in the infinite data limit) is provably beneficial, since the resulting errors can partially compensate for errors made by using an approximate prediction technique. En route to this result, we analyze the asymptotic properties of M-estimators based on convex variational relaxations, and establish a Lipschitz stability property that holds for a broad class of convex variational methods. This stability result provides additional incentive, apart from the obvious benefit of unique global optima, for using message-passing methods based on convex variational relaxations. We show that joint estimation/prediction based on the reweighted sum-product algorithm substantially outperforms a commonly used heuristic based on ordinary sum-product."

Each of these techniques constructs a graph such that the minimum cut on the graph also minimizes the energy. Yet, because these graph constructions are complex and highly specific to a particular energy function, graph cuts have seen limited application to date. In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph. A software implementation is freely available."

                "text": "Programming robot behavior remains a challenging task. While it is often easy to abstractly define or even demonstrate a desired behavior, designing a controller that embodies the same behavior is difficult, time consuming, and ultimately expensive. The machine learning paradigm offers the promise of enabling \u201cprogramming by demonstration\u201d for developing high-performance robotic systems. Unfortunately, many \u201cbehavioral cloning\u201d (Bain and Sammut in Machine intelligence agents. London: Oxford University Press, 1995; Pomerleau in Advances in neural information processing systems 1, 1989; LeCun et al. in Advances in neural information processing systems 18, 2006) approaches that utilize classical tools of supervised learning (e.g. decision trees, neural networks, or support vector machines) do not fit the needs of modern robotic systems. These systems are often built atop sophisticated planning algorithms that efficiently reason far into the future; consequently, ignoring these planning algorithms in lieu of a supervised learning approach often leads to myopic and poor-quality robot performance.While planning algorithms have shown success in many real-world applications ranging from legged locomotion (Chestnutt et al. in Proceedings of the IEEE-RAS international conference on humanoid robots, 2003) to outdoor unstructured navigation (Kelly et al. in Proceedings of the international symposium on experimental robotics (ISER), 2004; Stentz et al. in AUVSI\u2019s unmanned systems, 2007), such algorithms rely on fully specified cost functions that map sensor readings and environment models to quantifiable costs. Such cost functions are usually manually designed and programmed. Recently, a set of techniques has been developed that explore learning these functions from expert human demonstration. These algorithms apply an inverse optimal control approach to find a cost function for which planned behavior mimics an expert\u2019s demonstration.The work we present extends the Maximum Margin Planning (MMP) (Ratliff et al. in Twenty second international conference on machine learning (ICML06), 2006a) framework to admit learning of more powerful, non-linear cost functions. These algorithms, known collectively as LEARCH (LEArning to seaRCH), are simpler to implement than most existing methods, more efficient than previous attempts at non-linearization (Ratliff et al. in NIPS, 2006b), more naturally satisfy common constraints on the cost function, and better represent our prior beliefs about the function\u2019s form. We derive and discuss the framework both mathematically and intuitively, and demonstrate practical real-world performance with three applied case-studies including legged locomotion, grasp planning, and autonomous outdoor unstructured navigation. The latter study includes hundreds of kilometers of autonomous traversal through complex natural environments. These case-studies address key challenges in applying the algorithm in practical settings that utilize state-of-the-art planners, and which may be constrained by efficiency requirements and imperfect expert demonstration."

Unlike current algorithms for structured learning that require decomposition of both the loss function and the feature functions over the predicted structure, Searn is able to learn prediction functions for any loss function and any class of features.
