A similar system has been applied to the CoNLL text chunking shared task with state of the art performance. By using different linguistic features, we can easily adapt this system to other token-based linguistic tagging problems. The main focus of the current paper is to investigate the impact of various local linguistic features for named entity recognition on the CoNLL-2003 (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003) shared task data. We show that the system performance can be enhanced significantly with some relative simple token-based features that are available for many languages. Although more sophisticated linguistic features will also be helpful, they provide much less improvement than might be expected."

For example, the need for labeled data can be drastically reduced by taking advantage of domain knowledge in the form of word lists, part-of-speech tags, character n-grams, and capitalization patterns. While it is difficult to capture such inter-dependent features with a generative probabilistic model, conditionally-trained models, such as conditional maximum entropy models, handle them well. There has been significant work with such models for greedy sequence modeling in NLP (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Borthwick et al., 1998)."

As in the past year edition (Carreras et al., 2002a), we have approached the task by treating the two main sub\u2013tasks of the problem, recognition (NER) and classification (NEC), sequentially and independently with separate modules. Both modules are machine learning based systems, which make use of binary and multiclass AdaBoost classifiers. Named Entity recognition is performed as a greedy sequence tagging procedure under the well\u2013known BIO labelling scheme. This tagging process makes use of three binary classifiers trained to be experts on the recognition of B, I, and O labels, respectively. Named Entity classification is viewed as a 4\u2013class classification problem (with LOC, PER, ORG, and MISC class labels), which is straightforwardly addressed by the use of a multiclass learning algorithm. The system presented here consists of a replication, with some minor changes, of the system that obtained the best results in the CoNLL-2002 NEE task. Therefore, it can be considered as a benchmark of the state\u2013of\u2013the\u2013 art technology for the current edition, and will allow also to make comparisons about the training corpora of both editions."

                "text": "This thesis describes a novel statistical named-entity (i.e. \u201cproper name\u201d) recognition system known as \u201cMENE\u201d (Maximum Entropy Named Entity). Named entity (N.E.) recognition is a form of information extraction in which we seek to classify every word in a document as being a person-name, organization, location, date, time, monetary value, percentage, or \u201cnone of the above\u201d. The task has particular significance for Internet search engines, machine translation, the automatic indexing of documents, and as a foundation for work on more complex information extraction tasks. \nTwo of the most significant problems facing the constructor of a named entity system are the questions of portability and system performance. A practical N.E. system will need to be ported frequently to new bodies of text and even to new languages. The challenge is to build a system which can be ported with minimal expense (in particular minimal programming by a computational linguist) while maintaining a high degree of accuracy in the new domains or languages. \nMENE attempts to address these issues through the use of maximum entropy probabilistic modeling. It utilizes a very flexible object-based architecture which allows it to make use of a broad range of knowledge sources in making its tagging decisions. In the DARPA-sponsored MUC-7 named entity evaluation, the system displayed an accuracy rate which was well-above the median, demonstrating that it can achieve the performance goal. In addition, we demonstrate that the system can be used as a post-processing tool to enhance the output of a hand-coded named entity recognizer through experiments in which MENE improved on the performance of N.E. systems from three different sites. Furthermore, when all three external recognizers are combined under MENE, we are able to achieve very strong results which, in some cases, appear to be competitive with human performance. \nFinally, we demonstrate the trans-lingual portability of the system. We ported the system to two Japanese-language named entity tasks, one of which involved a new named entity category, \u201cartifact\u201d. Our results on these tasks were competitive with the best systems built by native Japanese speakers despite the fact that the author speaks no Japanese."

This same method can be applied at a higher level of textual interpretation for locating chunks in the tagged text, including non-recursive \u201cbaseNP\u201d chunks. For this purpose, it is convenient to view chunking as a tagging problem by encoding the chunk structure in new tags attached to each word. In automatic tests using Treebank-derived data, this technique achieved recall and precision rates of roughly 93% for baseNP chunks (trained on 950K words) and 88% for somewhat more complex chunks that partition the sentence (trained on 200K words). Working in this new application and with larger template and training sets has also required some interesting adaptations to the transformation-based learning approach."
