These models are the trigram model, the tri-POS model (POS stands for parts of speech), and a smoothed trigram model with tied distributions for words three or more syllables long. The full trigram model gives the best performance but is most expensive in terms of data and storage requirements. The smoothed trigram and tri-POS models yield equivalent performance. For general text entry tasks, use of the tri-POS model is suggested since it is less sensitive to variations in the discourse domains. For applications specific to individual discourse domains, trigram models trained on data obtained from the target domain are recommended.<<ETX>>"

A trigram model based on word sequences requires a lot of memory and training samples to store and estimate its probabilities. To avoid these almost unsolvable problems, a trigram model of words whose probabilities are estimated from the trigram of categories and word occurrence probabilities in the dictionary is introduced. The probabilities of the trigram of categories and the word probabilities in the dictionary are estimated using the Brown Corpus Text Database[1]. This trigram model is efficiently applied to improve word recognition results using a dynamic programming technique. Moreover, probabilities of special word sequences (frozen word sequences) are extracted from the Brown Corpus Text Database and these probabilities are also integrated in the dynamic programming algorithm. Word recognition through speaker adaptation is carried out using three input speakers from the IBM office correspondence task database[3]. The word recognition rate was 80.9%. The trigram model improves the word recognition rate to 89.1%."

This is followed by a detailed discussion of three issues not treated in the literature: alternatives to the Baum-Welch algorithm; critical facets of the implementation of the algorithms, with emphasis on their numerical properties; and behavior of Markov models on certain artificial but realistic problems. Special attention is given to a particular class of Markov models, which we call \u201cleft-to-right\u201d models. This class of models is especially appropriate for isolated word recognition. The results of the application of these methods to an isolated word, speaker-independent speech recognition experiment are given in a companion paper."

Large vocabularies introduce difficulties involving the amount of computation the system must perform and the number of ambiguities it must resolve. But, for practical applications in general and for dictation tasks in particular, large vocabularies are required, because of the difficulties and inconveniences involved in restricting the speaker to the use of a limited vocabulary. This paper describes a new organization of the recognition process, Multilevel Decoding (MLD), that allows the system to support a Very-Large-Size Dictionary (VLSD)\u2014one comprising over 100,000 words. This significantly surpasses the capacity of previous speech-recognition systems. With MLD, the effect of dictionary size on the accuracy of recognition can be studied. In this paper, recognition experiments using 10,000- and 200,000-word dictionaries are compared. They indicate that recognition using a 200,000-word dictionary is more accurate than recognition using a 10,000-word dictionary (when unrecognized words are included in the error rate)."

VDMS will accept connected speech of a language describable by 25-50 phrase equations and having a vocabulary of approximately 1000 words formed from about 100 data records. The strategy is based on the concept of predictive linguistic constraints (PLC). The present concepts of fixed directionality in parsing are replaced by a more generalized approach. To facilitate this flexibility, the system comprises a set of near-independent coroutines that are interconnected by a software busing structure. The VDMS acoustic processors verify the predictions. Very loose matching criteria are used for locating the predicted words. Special attention is given to word segments that are experimentally determined to be most invariant."
