We show that once we have modified the output layer of a multilayer perceptron to provide mathematically correct probability distributions, and replaced the usual squared error criterion with a probability-based score, the result is equivalent to Maximum Mutual Information training, which has been used successfully to improve the performance of hidden Markov models for speech recognition. If the network is specially constructed to perform the recognition computations of a given kind of stochastic model based classifier then we obtain a method for discrimination-based training of the parameters of the models. Examples include an HMM-based word discriminator, which we call an 'Alphanet'."

By the use of two hidden layers in addition to an input and output layer it is capable of representing complex nonlinear decision surfaces. Three important properties of the TDNNs have been observed. First, it was able to invent without human interference meaningful linguistic abstractions in time and frequency such as formant tracking and segmentation. Second, it has learned to form alternate representations linking different acoustic events with the same higher level concept. In this fashion it can implement trading relations between lower level acoustic events leading to robust recognition performance despite considerable variability in the input speech. Third, the network is translation-invariant and does not rely on precise alignment or segmentation of the input. The TDNNs performance is compared with the best of hidden Markov models (HMMs) on a speaker-dependent phoneme-recognition task. The TDNN achieved a recognition of 98.5% compared to 93.7% for the HMM, i.e., a fourfold reduction in error.<<ETX>>"

This problem is to design a speech-recognition system which can extract from the speech waveform as much information as possible about the corresponding word sequence. The information extraction process is factored into two steps: a signal-processing step which converts a speech waveform into a sequence of informative acoustic feature vectors, and a step which models such a sequence. The authors are primarily concerned with the use of hidden Markov models to model sequences of feature vectors which lie in a continuous space. They explore the trade-off between packing information into such sequences and being able to model them accurately. The difficulty of developing accurate models of continuous-parameter sequences is addressed by investigating a method of parameter estimation which is designed to cope with inaccurate modeling assumptions.<<ETX>>"

As a recognition task, the speaker-dependent recognition of the phonemes B, D, and G in varying phonetic contexts was chosen. For comparison, several discrete hidden Markov models (HMM) were trained to perform the same task. Performance evaluation over 1946 testing tokens from three speakers showed that the TDNN achieves a recognition rate of 98.5% correct while the rate obtained by the best of the HMMs was only 93.7%. >"

We wish to treat the outputs of the network as probabilities of alternatives (e.g. pattern classes), conditioned on the inputs. We look for appropriate output non-linearities and for appropriate criteria for adaptation of the parameters of the network (e.g. weights). We explain two modifications: probability scoring, which is an alternative to squared error minimisation, and a normalised exponential (softmax) multi-input generalisation of the logistic non-linearity. The two modifications together result in quite simple arithmetic, and hardware implementation is not difficult either. The use of radial units (squared distance instead of dot product) immediately before the softmax output stage produces a network which computes posterior distributions over class labels based on an assumption of Gaussian within-class distributions. However the training, which uses cross-class information, can result in better performance at class discrimination than the usual within-class training method, unless the within-class distribution assumptions are actually correct."

                "text": "The performance of current speech recognition systems is far below that of humans. Neural nets offer the potential of providing massive parallelism, adaptation, and new algorithmic approaches to problems in speech recognition. Initial studies have demonstrated that multilayer networks with time delays can provide excellent discrimination between small sets of pre-segmented difficult-to-discriminate words, consonants, and vowels. Performance for these small vocabularies has often exceeded that of more conventional approaches. Physiological front ends have provided improved recognition accuracy in noise and a cochlea filter-bank that could be used in these front ends has been implemented using micro-power analog VLSI techniques. Techniques have been developed to scale networks up in size to handle larger vocabularies, to reduce training time, and to train nets with recurrent connections. Multilayer perceptron classifiers are being integrated into conventional continuous-speech recognizers. Neural net architectures have been developed to perform the computations required by vector quantizers, static pattern classifiers, and the Viterbi decoding algorithm. Further work is necessary for large-vocabulary continuous-speech problems, to develop training algorithms that progressively build internal word models, and to develop compact VLSI neural net hardware."

The representations comprised the output of an auditory model, cepstrum coefficients derived from an FFT-based mel-scale filter bank with various weighting schemes applied to the coefficients, cepstrum coefficients augmented with measures of their rates of change with time, and sets of linear discriminant functions derived from the filter-bank output and called IMELDA. The model outperformed the cepstrum representations except in noise-free connected-word tests, where it had a high insertion rate. The best cepstrum weighting scheme was derived from within-class variances. Its behavior may explain the empirical adjustments found necessary with other schemes. IMELDA outperformed all other representations in all conditions and is computationally simple.<<ETX>>"
