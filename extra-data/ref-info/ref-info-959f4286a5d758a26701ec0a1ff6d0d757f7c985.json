Inspired by data-driven methods, we propose an exemplar-based approach to the task of instance segmentation, in which a set of reference image/shape masks is used to find multiple objects. We design a novel CRF framework that jointly models object appearance, shape deformation, and object occlusion. To tackle the challenging MAP inference problem, we derive an alternating procedure that interleaves object segmentation and shape/appearance adaptation. We evaluate our method on two datasets with instance labels and show promising results."

Our detectors produce class-specific scores for bottom-up regions, and then aggregate the votes of multiple overlapping candidates through pixel classification. We evaluate our approach on the PASCAL segmentation challenge, and report competitive performance with respect to current leading techniques. On VOC2010, our method obtains the best results in 6/20 categories and the highest performance on articulated objects."

This assumption makes this representation less robust to the object with occlusion [16]. In this paper, we augment the bounding box with a set of binary variables each of which corresponds to a cell indicating whether the pixels in the cell belong to the object. This segmentation-aware representation explicitly models and accounts for the supporting pixels for the object within the bounding box thus more robust to occlusion. We learn the model in a structured output framework, and develop a method that efficiently performs both inference and learning using this rich representation. The method is able to use segmentation reasoning to achieve improved detection results with richer output (cell level segmentation) on the Street Scenes and Pascal VOC 2007 datasets. Finally, we present a globally coherent object model using our rich representation to account for object-object occlusion resulting in a more coherent image understanding."

Motivated by the complementary effect observed from the typical failure cases of the two tasks, we propose a unified framework for joint object detection and semantic segmentation. By enforcing the consistency between final detection and segmentation results, our unified framework can effectively leverage the advantages of leading techniques for these two tasks. Furthermore, both local and global context information are integrated into the framework to better distinguish the ambiguous samples. By jointly optimizing the model parameters for all the components, the relative importance of different component is automatically learned for each category to guarantee the overall performance. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2010 and 2012 datasets demonstrate encouraging performance of the proposed unified framework for both object detection and semantic segmentation tasks."

Existing shape priors assume class-specific knowledge, and thus are restricted to cases where the object class is known in advance. The main insight of our approach is that shapes are often shared between objects of different categories. To exploit this \"shape sharing\" phenomenon, we develop a non-parametric prior that transfers object shapes from an exemplar database to a test image based on local shape matching. The transferred shape priors are then enforced in a graph-cut formulation to produce a pool of object segment hypotheses. Unlike previous multiple segmentation methods, our approach benefits from global shape cues; unlike previous top-down methods, it assumes no class-specific training and thus enhances segmentation even for unfamiliar categories. On the challenging PASCAL 2010 and Berkeley Segmentation datasets, we show it outperforms the state-of-the-art in bottom-up or category-independent segmentation."

Whereas previous approaches primarily modeled local coherency of occlusions or attempted to learn the structure of occlusions from data, we propose to explicitly model occlusions by reasoning about 3D interactions of objects. Our approach accurately represents occlusions under arbitrary viewpoint without requiring additional training data, which can often be difficult to obtain. We validate our model by extending the state-of-the-art LINE2D method for object instance detection and demonstrate significant improvement in recognizing textureless objects under severe occlusions."

Rather than attempting to represent an object category with a monolithic model, or pre-defining a reduced set of aspects, we form visual clusters from the data that are tight in appearance and configuration spaces. We train individual classifiers for each component, and then learn a second classifier that operates at the category level by aggregating responses from multiple components. In order to reduce computation cost during detection, we adopt the idea of object window selection, and our segmentation-based selection mechanism produces fewer than 500 windows per image while preserving high object recall. When compared to the leading methods in the challenging VOC PASCAL 2010 dataset, our multi-component approach obtains highly competitive results. Furthermore, unlike monolithic detection methods, our approach allows the transfer of finer-grained semantic information from the components, such as keypoint location and segmentation masks."

Starting with an initial pixel labeling and a set of candidate object masks for a given test image, we select a subset of objects that explain the image well and have valid overlap relationships and occlusion ordering. This is done by minimizing an integer quadratic program either using a greedy method or a standard solver. Then we alternate between using the object predictions to refine the pixel labels and vice versa. The proposed system obtains promising results on two challenging subsets of the LabelMe and SUN datasets, the largest of which contains 45, 676 images and 232 classes."

We take a strongly supervised, non-parametric approach to modeling occlusion by learning deformable models with many local part mixture templates using large quantities of synthetically generated training data. This allows the model to learn the appearance of different occlusion patterns including figure-ground cues such as the shapes of occluding contours as well as the co-occurrence statistics of occlusion between neighboring parts. The underlying part mixture-structure also allows the model to capture coherence of object support masks between neighboring parts and make compelling predictions of figure-ground-occluder segmentations. We test the resulting model on human pose estimation under heavy occlusion and find it produces improved localization accuracy."

We build on recent work that uses convolutional neural networks to classify category-independent region proposals (R-CNN [16]), introducing a novel architecture tailored for SDS. We then use category-specific, top-down figure-ground predictions to refine our bottom-up proposals. We show a 7 point boost (16% relative) over our baselines on SDS, a 5 point boost (10% relative) over state-of-the-art on semantic segmentation, and state-of-the-art performance in object detection.

We propose to automatically populate it with pixelwise segmentations, by leveraging existing manual annotations in the form of class labels and bounding-boxes. The key idea is to recursively exploit images segmented so far to guide the segmentation of new images. At each stage this propagation process expands into the images which are easiest to segment at that point in time, e.g. by moving to the semantically most related classes to those segmented so far. The propagation of segmentation occurs both (a) at the image level, by transferring existing segmentations to estimate the probability of a pixel to be foreground, and (b) at the class level, by jointly segmenting images of the same class and by importing the appearance models of classes that are already segmented. Through an experiment on 577 classes and 500k images we show that our technique (i) annotates a wide range of classes with accurate segmentations; (ii) effectively exploits the hierarchical structure of ImageNet; (iii) scales efficiently; (iv) outperforms a baseline GrabCut [1] initialized on the image center, as well as our recent segmentation transfer technique [2] on which this paper is based. Moreover, our method also delivers state-of-the-art results on the recent iCoseg dataset for co-segmentation."

Our Layout Consistent Random Field (LayoutCRF) model then imposes asymmetric local spatial constraints on these labels to ensure the consistent layout of parts whilst allowing for object deformation. Arbitrary occlusions of the object are handled by avoiding the assumption that the whole object is visible. The resulting system is both efficient to train and to apply to novel images, due to a novel annealed layout-consistent expansion move algorithm paired with a randomised decision tree classifier. We apply our technique to images of cars and faces and demonstrate state-of-the-art detection and segmentation performance even in the presence of partial occlusion."

The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30% relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012 -- achieving a mAP of 53.3%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also present experiments that provide insight into what the network learns, revealing a rich hierarchy of image features. Source code for the complete system is available at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rbg/rcnn."

The object hypotheses are represented as figure-ground segmentations, and are extracted automatically, without prior knowledge of the properties of individual object classes, by solving a sequence of Constrained Parametric Min-Cut problems (CPMC) on a regular image grid. In a subsequent step, we learn to rank the corresponding segments by training a continuous model to predict how likely they are to exhibit real-world regularities (expressed as putative overlap with ground truth) based on their mid-level region properties, then diversify the estimated overlap score using maximum marginal relevance measures. We show that this algorithm significantly outperforms the state of the art for low-level segmentation in the VOC 2009 and 2010 data sets. In our companion papers [1], [2], we show that the algorithm can be used, successfully, in a segmentation-based visual object category recognition pipeline. This architecture ranked first in the VOC2009 and VOC2010 image segmentation and labeling challenges."

Many interactive methods have been proposed utilizing user input in the form of mouse clicks and mouse strokes, and often requiring a lot of user intervention. In this paper, we present a system with a far simpler input method: the user needs only give the name of the desired object. With the tag provided by the user we do a text query of an image database to gather exemplars of the object. Using object proposals and borrowing ideas from image retrieval and object detection, the object is localized in the target image. An appearance model generated from the exemplars and the location prior are used in an energy minimization framework to select the object. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on existing datasets and on a more challenging dataset we collected."

In view of this, we propose to model an object class by a cascaded boosting classifier which integrates various types of features from competing local regions, named as region lets. A region let is a base feature extraction region defined proportionally to a detection window at an arbitrary resolution (i.e. size and aspect ratio). These region lets are organized in small groups with stable relative positions to delineate fine grained spatial layouts inside objects. Their features are aggregated to a one-dimensional feature within one group so as to tolerate deformations. Then we evaluate the object bounding box proposal in selective search from segmentation cues, limiting the evaluation locations to thousands. Our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on popular multi-class detection benchmark datasets with a single method, without any contexts. It achieves the detection mean average precision of 41.7% on the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset and 39.7% on the VOC 2010 for 20 object categories. It achieves 14.7% mean average precision on the Image Net dataset for 200 object categories, outperforming the latest deformable part-based model (DPM) by 4.7%."

Different from many CRF approaches that rely on dependencies modeled with unary and pairwise pixel or super pixel potentials, our method is entirely based on estimates of the overlap between each of a set of mid-level object segmentation proposals and the objects present in the image. We define continuous latent variables on super pixels obtained by multiple intersections of segments, then output the optimal segments from the inferred super pixel statistics. The algorithm is capable of recombine and refine initial mid-level proposals, as well as handle multiple interacting objects, even from the same class, all in a consistent joint inference framework by maximizing the composite likelihood of the underlying statistical model using an EM algorithm. In the PASCAL VOC segmentation challenge, the proposed approach obtains high accuracy and successfully handles images of complex object interactions."

Finally, we propose a grouping strategy that combines our multiscale regions into highly-accurate object candidates by exploring efficiently their combinatorial space. We conduct extensive experiments on both the BSDS500 and on the PASCAL 2012 segmentation datasets, showing that MCG produces state-of-the-art contours, hierarchical regions and object candidates."

Whereas traditional local interest operators rely on repeatable structures that often cross object boundaries (e.g., corners, scale-space blobs), our sampling strategy is driven by segmentation, and thus preserves object boundaries and shape. At the same time, whereas existing region-based representations are sensitive to segmentation parameters and object deformations, our novel approach to robustly sample dense sites and determine their connectivity offers better repeatability. In extensive experiments, we find that the proposed region detector provides significantly better repeatability and localization accuracy for object matching compared to an array of existing feature detectors. In addition, we show our regions lead to excellent results on two benchmark tasks that require good feature matching: weakly supervised foreground discovery and nearest neighbor-based object recognition."

We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

While the state-of-the-art algorithm based on globalized probability of boundary (gPb) generates a hierarchical region tree, it entails significant computational load. In this work, we exploit an efficient algorithm for structured edge prediction to extract regions. To generate high quality regions, we develop a novel algorithm to link the structured edge and gPb hierarchical image segmentation framework with steerable filters. The extracted regions are grouped by the proposed hierarchical grouping method to generate object proposals for effective detection and recognition problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our region generation for image segmentation on the BSDS500 database, and region generation for object proposals on the PASCAL VOC 2007 benchmark database. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the comparable or superior quality to the state-of-the-art methods."

We define generic ultrametric distances by integrating local contour cues along the regions boundaries and combining this information with region attributes.

For instance, the classification scores of the Bag of Features (BoF) model for image classification have been used to build a top-down categorization cost in a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model for semantic segmentation. Recent work shows that discriminative sparse dictionary learning (DSDL) can improve upon the unsupervised K-means dictionary learning method used in the BoF model due to the ability of DSDL to capture discriminative features from different classes. However, to the best of our knowledge, DSDL has not been used for building a top-down categorization cost for semantic segmentation. In this paper, we propose a CRF model that incorporates a DSDL based top-down cost for semantic segmentation. We show that the new CRF energy can be minimized using existing efficient discrete optimization techniques. Moreover, we propose a new method for jointly learning the CRF parameters, object classifiers and the visual dictionary. Our experiments demonstrate that by jointly learning these parameters, the feature representation becomes more discriminative and the segmentation performance improves with respect to that of state-of-the-art methods that use unsupervised K-means dictionary learning."

Our contour detector combines multiple local cues into a globalization framework based on spectral clustering. Our segmentation algorithm consists of generic machinery for transforming the output of any contour detector into a hierarchical region tree. In this manner, we reduce the problem of image segmentation to that of contour detection. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that both our contour detection and segmentation methods significantly outperform competing algorithms. The automatically generated hierarchical segmentations can be interactively refined by user-specified annotations. Computation at multiple image resolutions provides a means of coupling our system to recognition applications."

For example, we desire to obtain an understanding of natural scenes, containing roads, buildings, trees, bushes, etc., as typified by the two frames from a sequence illustrated in Figure 1. The solution to this problem that we are pursuing is to use a computer vision system based upon motion analysis of a monocular image sequence from a mobile camera. By extraction and tracking of image features, representations of the 3D analogues of these features can be constructed."

Classical image segmentation tools use either texture (colour) information, e.g. Magic Wand, or edge (contrast) information, e.g. Intelligent Scissors. Recently, an approach based on optimization by graph-cut has been developed which successfully combines both types of information. In this paper we extend the graph-cut approach in three respects. First, we have developed a more powerful, iterative version of the optimisation. Secondly, the power of the iterative algorithm is used to simplify substantially the user interaction needed for a given quality of result. Thirdly, a robust algorithm for \"border matting\" has been developed to estimate simultaneously the alpha-matte around an object boundary and the colours of foreground pixels. We show that for moderately difficult examples the proposed method outperforms competitive tools."

Organised annually from 2005 to present, the challenge and its associated dataset has become accepted as the benchmark for object detection.This paper describes the dataset and evaluation procedure. We review the state-of-the-art in evaluated methods for both classification and detection, analyse whether the methods are statistically different, what they are learning from the images (e.g. the object or its context), and what the methods find easy or confuse. The paper concludes with lessons learnt in the three year history of the challenge, and proposes directions for future improvement and extension."

Patches of edges exhibit well-known forms of local structure, such as straight lines or T-junctions. In this paper we take advantage of the structure present in local image patches to learn both an accurate and computationally efficient edge detector. We formulate the problem of predicting local edge masks in a structured learning framework applied to random decision forests. Our novel approach to learning decision trees robustly maps the structured labels to a discrete space on which standard information gain measures may be evaluated. The result is an approach that obtains real time performance that is orders of magnitude faster than many competing state-of-the-art approaches, while also achieving state-of-the-art edge detection results on the BSDS500 Segmentation dataset and NYU Depth dataset. Finally, we show the potential of our approach as a general purpose edge detector by showing our learned edge models generalize well across datasets."

In this paper we explore novel pooling techniques that encode the second-order statistics of local descriptors inside a region. To achieve this effect, we introduce multiplicative second-order analogues of average and max-pooling that together with appropriate non-linearities lead to state-of-the-art performance on free-form region recognition, without any type of feature coding. Instead of coding, we found that enriching local descriptors with additional image information leads to large performance gains, especially in conjunction with the proposed pooling methodology. We show that second-order pooling over free-form regions produces results superior to those of the winning systems in the Pascal VOC 2011 semantic segmentation challenge, with models that are 20,000 times faster."

Although many shape matching algorithms have been proposed for the problem over the decades, chamfer matching remains to be the preferred method when speed and robustness are considered. In this paper, we significantly improve the accuracy of chamfer matching while reducing the computational time from linear to sublinear (shown empirically). Specifically, we incorporate edge orientation information in the matching algorithm such that the resulting cost function is piecewise smooth and the cost variation is tightly bounded. Moreover, we present a sublinear time algorithm for exact computation of the directional chamfer matching score using techniques from 3D distance transforms and directional integral images. In addition, the smooth cost function allows to bound the cost distribution of large neighborhoods and skip the bad hypotheses within. Experiments show that the proposed approach improves the speed of the original chamfer matching upto an order of 45x, and it is much faster than many state of art techniques while the accuracy is comparable."

The proposed registration algorithm is being developed by Seth Billings, a graduate student, and it will map the extracted contours to patient CT data in order to enhance registration.

We make the following contributions: (i) we note that extending the Structured Output Regression formulation of Blaschko and Lampert [1] to include a bias term significantly improves performance; (ii) that alignment (to account for small rotations and anisotropic scalings) can be included as a latent variable and efficiently determined and implemented; (iii) that the latent variable extends to multiple aspects (e.g. left facing, right facing, front) with the same formulation; and (iv), most significantly for performance, that truncated and truncated instances can be included in both training and inference with an explicit truncation mask. \n \nWe demonstrate the method by training and testing on the PASCAL VOC 2007 data set - training includes the truncated examples, and in testing object instances are detected at multiple scales, alignments, and with significant truncations."

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively, which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called \"dropout\" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry."

Such \u201cexemplars\u201d can be found by randomly choosing an initial subset of data points and then iteratively refining it, but this works well only if that initial choice is close to a good solution. We devised a method called \u201caffinity propagation,\u201d which takes as input measures of similarity between pairs of data points. Real-valued messages are exchanged between data points until a high-quality set of exemplars and corresponding clusters gradually emerges. We used affinity propagation to cluster images of faces, detect genes in microarray data, identify representative sentences in this manuscript, and identify cities that are efficiently accessed by airline travel. Affinity propagation found clusters with much lower error than other methods, and it did so in less than one-hundredth the amount of time."
