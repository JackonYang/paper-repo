The user supplies a query object by selecting a region of a query image, and the system returns a ranked list of images that contain the same object, retrieved from a large corpus. We demonstrate the scalability and performance of our system on a dataset of over 1 million images crawled from the photo-sharing site, Flickr [3], using Oxford landmarks as queries. Building an image-feature vocabulary is a major time and performance bottleneck, due to the size of our dataset. To address this problem we compare different scalable methods for building a vocabulary and introduce a novel quantization method based on randomized trees which we show outperforms the current state-of-the-art on an extensive ground-truth. Our experiments show that the quantization has a major effect on retrieval quality. To further improve query performance, we add an efficient spatial verification stage to re-rank the results returned from our bag-of-words model and show that this consistently improves search quality, though by less of a margin when the visual vocabulary is large. We view this work as a promising step towards much larger, \"web-scale \" image corpora."

The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. The result is that retrieved is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of Google. The method is illustrated for matching in two full length feature films."

The efficiency and quality is exhibited in a live demonstration that recognizes CD-covers from a database of 40000 images of popular music CD\u2019s. The scheme builds upon popular techniques of indexing descriptors extracted from local regions, and is robust to background clutter and occlusion. The local region descriptors are hierarchically quantized in a vocabulary tree. The vocabulary tree allows a larger and more discriminatory vocabulary to be used efficiently, which we show experimentally leads to a dramatic improvement in retrieval quality. The most significant property of the scheme is that the tree directly defines the quantization. The quantization and the indexing are therefore fully integrated, essentially being one and the same. The recognition quality is evaluated through retrieval on a database with ground truth, showing the power of the vocabulary tree approach, going as high as 1 million images."

However, these approaches fail when these factors are too strong, due to the limited repeatability and discriminative power of the features. As additional shortcomings, the objects need to be rigid and only their approximate location is found. We present a novel Object Recognition approach which overcomes these limitations. An initial set of feature correspondences is first generated. The method anchors on it and then gradually explores the surrounding area, trying to construct more and more matching features, increasingly farther from the initial ones. The resulting process covers the object with matches, and simultaneously separates the correct matches from the wrong ones. Hence, recognition and segmentation are achieved at the same time. Only very few correct initial matches suffice for reliable recognition. The experimental results demonstrate the stronger power of the presented method in dealing with extensive clutter, dominant occlusion, large scale and viewpoint changes. Moreover non-rigid deformations are explicitly taken into account, and the approximative contours of the object are produced. The approach can extend any viewpoint invariant feature extractor."

However, the existing approaches are based on matching to individual training images. This paper presents a method for combining multiple images of a 3D object into a single model representation. This provides for recognition of 3D objects from any viewpoint, the generalization of models to non-rigid changes, and improved robustness through the combination of features acquired under a range of imaging conditions. The decision of whether to cluster a training image into an existing view representation or to treat it as a new view is based on the geometric accuracy of the match to previous model views. A new probabilistic model is developed to reduce the false positive matches that would otherwise arise due to loosened geometric constraints on matching 3D and non-rigid models. A system has been developed based on these approaches that is able to robustly recognize 3D objects in cluttered natural images in sub-second times."

Our approach relies on retrieving geotagged photos from those web-sites using a grid of geospatial tiles. The downloaded photos are clustered into potentially interesting entities through a processing pipeline of several modalities, including visual, textual and spatial proximity. The resulting clusters are analyzed and are automatically classified into objects and events. Using mining techniques, we then find text labels for these clusters, which are used to again assign each cluster to a corresponding Wikipedia article in a fully unsupervised manner. A final verification step uses the contents (including images) from the selected Wikipedia article to verify the cluster-article assignment. We demonstrate this approach on several urban areas, densely covering an area of over 700 square kilometers and mining over 200,000 photos, making it probably the largest experiment of its kind to date."

Recently, several wide baseline matching algorithms capable of handling large changes of viewpoint have appeared. By computing feature values from image data, these algorithms mainly use appearance as a cue for matching. Topological information, i.e. spatial relations between features, has also been used, but not nearly to the same extent as appearance. In this paper, we incorporate topological constraints into an existing matching algorithm [1] which matches image intensity profiles between interest points. We show that the algorithm can be improved by exploiting the constraint that the intensity profiles around each interest point should be cyclically ordered. String matching techniques allows for an efficient implementation of the ordering constraint. Experiments with real data indicate that the modified algorithm indeed gives superior results to the original one. The method of enforcing the spatial constraints is not limited to the presented case, but can be used on any algorithm where interest point correspondences are sought."

The method is based on local characteristics which are invariant to similarity transformations in the image. These characteristics are computed at automatically detected keypoints using the greyvalue signal. The method therefore works on images such as paintings for which geometry based recognition fails. Due to the locality of the method, images can be recognized being given part of an image and in the presence of occlusions. Applying a voting algorithm and semi-local constraints makes the method robust to noise, scene clutter and small perspective deformations. Experiments show an efficient recognition for different types of images. The approach has been validated on an image database containing 1020 images, some of them being very similar by structure, texture or shape."

Our system consists of an image-based modeling front end that automatically computes the viewpoint of each photograph as well as a sparse 3D model of the scene and image to model correspondences. Our photo explorer uses image-based rendering techniques to smoothly transition between photographs, while also enabling full 3D navigation and exploration of the set of images and world geometry, along with auxiliary information such as overhead maps. Our system also makes it easy to construct photo tours of scenic or historic locations, and to annotate image details, which are automatically transferred to other relevant images. We demonstrate our system on several large personal photo collections as well as images gathered from Internet photo sharing sites."

Object candidates are detected by finding recurring spatial arrangements of affine covariant regions. Our mining method is based on the class of frequent itemset mining algorithms, which have proven their efficiency in other domains, but have not been applied to video mining before. In this work we show how to express vector-quantized features and their spatial relations as itemsets. Furthermore, a fast motion segmentation method is introduced as an attention filter for the mining algorithm. Results are shown on real world data consisting of music video clips."

Our scale and affine invariant detectors are based on the following recent results: (1) Interest points extracted with the Harris detector can be adapted to affine transformations and give repeatable results (geometrically stable). (2) The characteristic scale of a local structure is indicated by a local extremum over scale of normalized derivatives (the Laplacian). (3) The affine shape of a point neighborhood is estimated based on the second moment matrix.Our scale invariant detector computes a multi-scale representation for the Harris interest point detector and then selects points at which a local measure (the Laplacian) is maximal over scales. This provides a set of distinctive points which are invariant to scale, rotation and translation as well as robust to illumination changes and limited changes of viewpoint. The characteristic scale determines a scale invariant region for each point. We extend the scale invariant detector to affine invariance by estimating the affine shape of a point neighborhood. An iterative algorithm modifies location, scale and neighborhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. This method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. The characteristic scale and the affine shape of neighborhood determine an affine invariant region for each point.We present a comparative evaluation of different detectors and show that our approach provides better results than existing methods. The performance of our detector is also confirmed by excellent matching results; the image is described by a set of scale/affine invariant descriptors computed on the regions associated with our points."

Explicit calibration is not always practical and has to be repeated regularly. Sometimes it is even impossible (i.e. for pictures taken by an unknown camera of an unknown scene). The second possibility is to do auto-calibration. Here the rigidity of the scene is used to obtain constraints on the camera parameters. Existing approaches of this second strand impose that the camera parameters stay exactly the same between different views. This can be very limiting since it excludes changing the focal length to zoom or focus. The paper describes a reconstruction method that allows to vary the focal length. Instead of using one camera one can also use a stereo rig following similar principles, and in which case also reconstruction from a moving rig becomes possible even for pure translation. Synthetic data were used to see how resistant the algorithm is to noise. The results are satisfactory. Also results for a real scene were convincing."

It has been observed that, to find an optimal solution (with a given probability), the number of samples drawn in ransac is significantly higher than predicted from the mathematical model. This is due to the incorrect assumption, that a model with parameters computed from an outlier-free sample is consistent with all inliers. The assumption rarely holds in practice. The locally optimized ransac makes no new assumptions about the data, on the contrary \u2013 it makes the above-mentioned assumption valid by applying local optimization to the solution estimated from the random sample."
