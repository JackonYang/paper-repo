We differ from existing approaches not only in our seemingly unreasonable assumption that good object-level segments can be obtained in a feed-forward fashion, but also in formulating recognition as a regression problem. Instead of focusing on a one-vs.-all winning margin that may not preserve the ordering of segment qualities inside the non-maximum (non-winning) set, our learning method produces a globally consistent ranking with close ties to segment quality, hence to the extent entire object or part hypotheses are likely to spatially overlap the ground truth. We demonstrate results beyond the current state of the art for image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation, in a number of challenging datasets including Caltech-101, ETHZ-Shape as well as PASCAL VOC 2009 and 2010."

For this purpose, we propose a novel design for region-based object detectors that integrates efficiently top-down information from scanning-windows part models and global appearance cues. Our detectors produce class-specific scores for bottom-up regions, and then aggregate the votes of multiple overlapping candidates through pixel classification. We evaluate our approach on the PASCAL segmentation challenge, and report competitive performance with respect to current leading techniques. On VOC2010, our method obtains the best results in 6/20 categories and the highest performance on articulated objects."

The object hypotheses are represented as figure-ground segmentations, and are extracted automatically, without prior knowledge about properties of individual object classes, by solving a sequence of constrained parametric min-cut problems (CPMC) on a regular image grid. We then learn to rank the object hypotheses by training a continuous model to predict how plausible the segments are, given their mid-level region properties. We show that this algorithm significantly outperforms the state of the art for low-level segmentation in the VOC09 segmentation dataset. It achieves the same average best segmentation covering as the best performing technique to date [2], 0.61 when using just the top 7 ranked segments, instead of the full hierarchy in [2]. Our method achieves 0.78 average best covering using 154 segments. In a companion paper [18], we also show that the algorithm achieves state-of-the art results when used in a segmentation-based recognition pipeline."

It is well known that each quantisation has its fair share of pros and cons; and the existence of a common optimal quantisation level suitable for all object categories is highly unlikely. Motivated by this observation, we propose a hierarchical random field model, that allows integration of features computed at different levels of the quantisation hierarchy. MAP inference in this model can be performed efficiently using powerful graph cut based move making algorithms. Our framework generalises much of the previous work based on pixels or segments. We evaluate its efficiency on some of the most challenging data-sets for object class segmentation, and show it obtains state-of-the-art results."

Our approach is to generate a set of segmentations by performing graph cuts based on a seed region and a learned affinity function. Then, the regions are ranked using structured learning based on various cues.

In this paper we explore novel pooling techniques that encode the second-order statistics of local descriptors inside a region. To achieve this effect, we introduce multiplicative second-order analogues of average and max-pooling that together with appropriate non-linearities lead to state-of-the-art performance on free-form region recognition, without any type of feature coding. Instead of coding, we found that enriching local descriptors with additional image information leads to large performance gains, especially in conjunction with the proposed pooling methodology. We show that second-order pooling over free-form regions produces results superior to those of the winning systems in the Pascal VOC 2011 semantic segmentation challenge, with models that are 20,000 times faster."

To tie these ideas together we compute multiple segmentations of each image and then: (i) learn the object classes; and (ii) choose the correct segmentations.

Existing shape priors assume class-specific knowledge, and thus are restricted to cases where the object class is known in advance. The main insight of our approach is that shapes are often shared between objects of different categories. To exploit this \"shape sharing\" phenomenon, we develop a non-parametric prior that transfers object shapes from an exemplar database to a test image based on local shape matching. The transferred shape priors are then enforced in a graph-cut formulation to produce a pool of object segment hypotheses. Unlike previous multiple segmentation methods, our approach benefits from global shape cues; unlike previous top-down methods, it assumes no class-specific training and thus enhances segmentation even for unfamiliar categories. On the challenging PASCAL 2010 and Berkeley Segmentation datasets, we show it outperforms the state-of-the-art in bottom-up or category-independent segmentation."

Our method is based on higher order conditional random fields and uses potentials defined on sets of pixels (image segments) generated using unsupervised segmentation algorithms. These potentials enforce label consistency in image regions and can be seen as a generalization of the commonly used pairwise contrast sensitive smoothness potentials. The higher order potential functions used in our framework take the form of the Robust Pn model and are more general than the Pn Potts model recently proposed by Kohli et al. We prove that the optimal swap and expansion moves for energy functions composed of these potentials can be computed by solving a st-mincut problem. This enables the use of powerful graph cut based move making algorithms for performing inference in the framework. We test our method on the problem of multi-class object segmentation by augmenting the conventional crf used for object segmentation with higher order potentials defined on image regions. Experiments on challenging data sets show that integration of higher order potentials quantitatively and qualitatively improves results leading to much better definition of object boundaries. We believe that this method can be used to yield similar improvements for many other labelling problems."

                "text": "The Hierarchical Conditional Random Field (HCRF) model have been successfully applied to a num- ber of image labeling problems, including image segmenta- tion. However, existing HCRF models of image segmenta- tion do not allow multiple classes to be assigned to a single region, which limits their ability to incorporate contextual information across multiple scales. At higher scales in the image, this representation yields an oversimplified model since multiple classes can be reasonably expected to appear within large regions. This simplified model particularly lim- its the impact of information at higher scales. Since class- label information at these scales is usually more reliable than at lower, noisier scales, neglecting this information is undesirable. To address these issues, we propose a new con- sistency potential for image labeling problems, which we call the harmony potential. It can encode any possible com- bination of labels, penalizing only unlikely combinations of classes. We also propose an effective sampling strategy over this expanded label set that renders tractable the underlying optimization problem. Our approach obtains state-of-the- art results on two challenging, standard benchmark datasets"

While the fine-level state-space of poses of individual parts is too large to permit the use of rich appearance models, most possibilities can be ruled out by efficient structured models at a coarser scale. We propose to learn a sequence of structured models at different pose resolutions, where coarse models filter the pose space for the next level via their max-marginals. The cascade is trained to prune as much as possible while preserving true poses for the final level pictorial structure model. The final level uses much more expensive segmentation, contour and shape features in the model for the remaining filtered set of candidates. We evaluate our framework on the challenging Buffy and PASCAL human pose datasets, improving the state-of-the-art."

Region features are appealing in this context because: (1) they encode shape and scale information of objects naturally; (2) they are only mildly affected by background clutter. Regions have not been popular as features due to their sensitivity to segmentation errors. In this paper, we start by producing a robust bag of overlaid regions for each image using Arbeldez et al., CVPR 2009. Each region is represented by a rich set of image cues (shape, color and texture). We then learn region weights using a max-margin framework. In detection and segmentation, we apply a generalized Hough voting scheme to generate hypotheses of object locations, scales and support, followed by a verification classifier and a constrained segmenter on each hypothesis. The proposed approach significantly outperforms the state of the art on the ETHZ shape database(87.1% average detection rate compared to Ferrari et al. 's 67.2%), and achieves competitive performance on the Caltech 101 database."

                "text": "The Hierarchical Conditional Random Field (HCRF) model have been successfully applied to a number of image labeling problems, including image segmentation. However, existing HCRF models of image segmentation do not allow multiple classes to be assigned to a single region, which limits their ability to incorporate contextual information across multiple scales. At higher scales in the image, this representation yields an oversimplified model since multiple classes can be reasonably expected to appear within large regions. This simplified model particularly limits the impact of information at higher scales. Since class-label information at these scales is usually more reliable than at lower, noisier scales, neglecting this information is undesirable. To address these issues, we propose a new consistency potential for image labeling problems, which we call the harmony potential. It can encode any possible combination of labels, penalizing only unlikely combinations of classes. We also propose an effective sampling strategy over this expanded label set that renders tractable the underlying optimization problem. Our approach obtains state-of-the-art results on two challenging, standard benchmark datasets for semantic image segmentation: PASCAL VOC 2010, and MSRC-21."

                "text": "This article considers approaches which rerank the output of an existing probabilistic parser. The base parser produces a set of candidate parses for each input sentence, with associated probabilities that define an initial ranking of these parses. A second model then attempts to improve upon this initial ranking, using additional features of the tree as evidence. The strength of our approach is that it allows a tree to be represented as an arbitrary set of features, without concerns about how these features interact or overlap and without the need to define a derivation or a generative model which takes these features into account. We introduce a new method for the reranking task, based on the boosting approach to ranking problems described in Freund et al. (1998). We apply the boosting method to parsing the Wall Street Journal treebank. The method combined the log-likelihood under a baseline model (that of Collins [1999]) with evidence from an additional 500,000 features over parse trees that were not included in the original model. The new model achieved 89.75 F-measure, a 13 relative decrease in F-measure error over the baseline model's score of 88.2. The article also introduces a new algorithm for the boosting approach which takes advantage of the sparsity of the feature space in the parsing data. Experiments show significant efficiency gains for the new algorithm over the obvious implementation of the boosting approach. We argue that the method is an appealing alternative-in terms of both simplicity and efficiency-to work on feature selection methods within log-linear (maximum-entropy) models. Although the experiments in this article are on natural language parsing (NLP), the approach should be applicable to many other NLP problems which are naturally framed as ranking tasks, for example, speech recognition, machine translation, or natural language generation."

In this paper we consider a class of global potentials defined over all variables in the CRF. We show how they can be readily optimised using standard graph cut algorithms at little extra expense compared to a standard pairwise field. \n \nThis result can be directly used for the problem of class based image segmentation which has seen increasing recent interest within computer vision. Here the aim is to assign a label to each pixel of a given image from a set of possible object classes. Typically these methods use random fields to model local interactions between pixels or super-pixels. One of the cues that helps recognition is global object co-occurrence statistics, a measure of which classes (such as chair or motorbike) are likely to occur in the same image together. There have been several approaches proposed to exploit this property, but all of them suffer from different limitations and typically carry a high computational cost, preventing their application on large images. We find that the new model we propose produces an improvement in the labelling compared to just using a pairwise model."

Recent computational approaches to SLU, e.g., conditional random fields (CRFs), optimize local models by encoding several features, mainly based on simple n-grams. In contrast, recent works have shown that the accuracy of CRF can be significantly improved by modeling long-distance dependency features. In this paper, we propose novel approaches to encode all possible dependencies between features and most importantly among parts of the meaning structure, e.g., concepts and their combination. We rerank hypotheses generated by local models, e.g., stochastic finite state transducers (SFSTs) or CRF, with a global model. The latter encodes a very large number of dependencies (in the form of trees or sequences) by applying kernel methods to the space of all meaning (sub) structures. We performed comparative experiments between SFST, CRF, support vector machines (SVMs), and our proposed discriminative reranking models (DRMs) on representative conversational speech corpora in three different languages: the ATIS (English), the MEDIA (French), and the LUNA (Italian) corpora. These corpora have been collected within three different domain applications of increasing complexity: informational, transactional, and problem-solving tasks, respectively. The results show that our DRMs consistently outperform the state-of-the-art models based on CRF."

Organised annually from 2005 to present, the challenge and its associated dataset has become accepted as the benchmark for object detection.This paper describes the dataset and evaluation procedure. We review the state-of-the-art in evaluated methods for both classification and detection, analyse whether the methods are statistically different, what they are learning from the images (e.g. the object or its context), and what the methods find easy or confuse. The paper concludes with lessons learnt in the three year history of the challenge, and proposes directions for future improvement and extension."

In many situations, one could benefit from additional high-probability solutions. Current methods for computing the M most probable configurations produce solutions that tend to be very similar to the MAP solution and each other. This is often an undesirable property. In this paper we propose an algorithm for the Diverse M-Best problem, which involves finding a diverse set of highly probable solutions under a discrete probabilistic model. Given a dissimilarity function measuring closeness of two solutions, our formulation involves maximizing a linear combination of the probability and dissimilarity to previous solutions. Our formulation generalizes the M-Best MAP problem and we show that for certain families of dissimilarity functions we can guarantee that these solutions can be found as easily as the MAP solution."

The limited topological structure of models and pre-specified part shapes are two main factors preventing these detectors from fully capturing large deformations. To better capture the deformations, we propose a novel approach to integrate the detections from a family of part-based detectors with patches of objects that have irregular shape. This integration is formulated as MAP inference in a Conditional Random Field (CRF). The energy function defined over the CRF takes into account the information provided by an object patch classifier and the object detector, and the goal is to augment the partial detections with missing patches, and also to refine the detections that include background clutter. The proposed method is evaluated on the object detection task of PASCAL VOC. Our experimental results show significant improvement over a base part-based detector (which is among the current state-of-the-art methods) especially for the deformable object classes."

In this work, we propose sidestepping intractable inference altogether by learning ensembles of tractable sub-models as part of a structured prediction cascade. We focus in particular on problems with high-treewidth and large state-spaces, which occur in many computer vision tasks. Unlike other variational methods, our ensembles do not enforce agreement between sub-models, but filter the space of possible outputs by simply adding and thresholding the max-marginals of each constituent model. Our framework jointly estimates parameters for all models in the ensemble for each level of the cascade by minimizing a novel, convex loss function, yet requires only a linear increase in computation over learning or inference in a single tractable sub-model. We provide a generalization bound on the filtering loss of the ensemble as a theoretical justification of our approach, and we evaluate our method on both synthetic data and the task of estimating articulated human pose from challenging videos. We find that our approach significantly outperforms loopy belief propagation on the synthetic data and a state-of-the-art model on the pose estimation/tracking problem."

We follow a reranking approach, where a baseline recogniser is used to produce 1000-best output for each acoustic input, and a second \"reranking\" model is then used to choose an utterance from these 1000-best lists. The reranking model makes use of syntactic features together with a parameter estimation method that is based on the perception algorithm. We describe experiments on the Switchboard speech recognition task. The syntactic features provide an additional 0.3% reduction in test-set error rate beyond the model of (Roark et al., 2004a; Roark et al., 2004b) (significant at p < 0.001), which makes use of a discriminatively trained n-gram model, giving a total reduction of 1.2% over the baseline Switchboard system."

However, current training algorithms are computationally expensive or intractable on large datasets. To overcome this bottleneck, this paper explores how cutting-plane methods can provide fast training not only for classification SVMs, but also for structural SVMs. We show that for an equivalent \u201c1-slack\u201d reformulation of the linear SVM training problem, our cutting-plane method has time complexity linear in the number of training examples. In particular, the number of iterations does not depend on the number of training examples, and it is linear in the desired precision and the regularization parameter. Furthermore, we present an extensive empirical evaluation of the method applied to binary classification, multi-class classification, HMM sequence tagging, and CFG parsing. The experiments show that the cutting-plane algorithm is broadly applicable and fast in practice. On large datasets, it is typically several orders of magnitude faster than conventional training methods derived from decomposition methods like SVM-light, or conventional cutting-plane methods. Implementations of our methods are available at www.joachims.org."

While recent progress in machine learning has mainly focused on designing flexible and powerful input representations, this paper addresses the complementary issue of designing classification algorithms that can deal with more complex outputs, such as trees, sequences, or sets. More generally, we consider problems involving multiple dependent output variables, structured output spaces, and classification problems with class attributes. In order to accomplish this, we propose to appropriately generalize the well-known notion of a separation margin and derive a corresponding maximum-margin formulation. While this leads to a quadratic program with a potentially prohibitive, i.e. exponential, number of constraints, we present a cutting plane algorithm that solves the optimization problem in polynomial time for a large class of problems. The proposed method has important applications in areas such as computational biology, natural language processing, information retrieval/extraction, and optical character recognition. Experiments from various domains involving different types of output spaces emphasize the breadth and generality of our approach."

We prove that, for tree graphs (and junction trees in general), this polytope has a particularly simple form and differs from the marginal polytope in a single inequality constraint. We use this characterization to provide an approximation scheme for non-tree graphs, by using the set of spanning trees over such graphs. The method we present puts the M-best inference problem in the context of LP relaxations, which have recently received considerable attention and have proven useful in solving difficult inference problems.

The N-Best algorithm is a time-synchronous Viterbi-style beam search algorithm that can be made to find the most likely N whole sentence alternatives that are within a given a \"beam\" of the most likely sentence. The algorithm can be shown to be exact under some reasonable constraints. That is, it guarantees that the answers it finds are, in fact, the most likely sentence hypotheses. The computation is linear with the length of the utterance, and faster than linear in N. When used together with a first-order statistical grammar, the correct sentence is usually within the first few sentence choices. The output of the algorithm, which is an ordered set of sentence hypotheses with acoustic and language model scores can easily be processed by natural language knowledge sources. Thus, this method of integrating speech recognition and natural language avoids the huge expansion of the search space that would be needed to include all possible knowledge sources in a top-down search. The algorithm has also been used to generate alternative sentence hypotheses for discriminative training. Finally, the alternative sentences generated are useful for testing overgeneration of syntax and semantics."

In applications ranging from protein folding to image analysis one would like to find not just the best configuration but rather the top M. While this problem has been solved using the junction tree formalism, in many real world problems the clique size in the junction tree is prohibitively large. In this work we address the problem of finding the M best configurations when exact inference is impossible. \n \nWe start by developing a new exact inference algorithm for calculating the best configurations that uses only max-marginals. For approximate inference, we replace the max-marginals with the beliefs calculated using max-product BP and generalized BP. We show empirically that the algorithm can accurately and rapidly approximate the M best configurations in graphs with hundreds of variables."
