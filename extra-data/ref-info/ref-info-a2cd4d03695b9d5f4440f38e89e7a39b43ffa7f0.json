The flat model allows us to model arbitrary attributes and dependences of the output. This is different from the HMMs typically used for speech recognition. This conventional modeling approach is based on sequential data and makes rigid assumptions on the dependences. HMMs have proven to be convenient and appropriate for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition. Our task under consideration, however, is the Windows Live Search for Mobile (WLS4M) task [1]. This is a cellphone application that allows users to interact with web-based information portals. In particular, the set of valid outputs can be considered discrete and finite (although probably large, i.e., unseen events are an issue). Hence, a flat direct model lends itself to this task, making the adding of different knowledge sources and dependences straightforward and cheap. Using e.g. HMM posterior, m-gram, and spotter features, significant improvements over the conventional HMM system were observed."

We show that WFSTs provide a common and natural representation for hidden Markov models (HMMs), context-dependency, pronunciation dictionaries, grammars, and alternative recognition outputs. Furthermore, general transducer operations combine these representations flexibly and efficiently. Weighted determinization and minimization algorithms optimize their time and space requirements, and a weight pushing algorithm distributes the weights along the paths of a weighted transducer optimally for speech recognition. As an example, we describe a North American Business News (NAB) recognition system built using these techniques that combines the HMMs, full cross-word triphones, a lexicon of 40 000 words, and a large trigram grammar into a single weighted transducer that is only somewhat larger than the trigram word grammar and that runs NAB in real-time on a very simple decoder. In another example, we show that the same techniques can be used to optimize lattices for second-pass recognition. In a third example, we show how general automata operations can be used to assemble lattices from different recognizers to improve recognition performance."

Key advances include the use of additional training data from the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC), use of a very large vocabulary comprising 737 K words and 2.5 M pronunciation variants, automatic vowelization using flat-start training, cross-adaptation between unvowelized and vowelized acoustic models, and rescoring with a neural-network language model. The resulting system achieves word error rates below 10% on Arabic broadcasts. Very large scale experiments with unsupervised training demonstrate that the utility of unsupervised data depends on the amount of supervised data available. While unsupervised training improves system performance when a limited amount (135 h) of supervised data is available, these gains disappear when a greater amount (848 h) of supervised data is used, even with a very large (7069 h) corpus of unsupervised data. We also describe a method for modeling Arabic dialects that avoids the problem of data sparseness entailed by dialect-specific acoustic models via the use of non-phonetic, dialect questions in the decision trees. We show how this method can be used with a statically compiled decoding graph by partitioning the decision trees into a static component and a dynamic component, with the dynamic component being replaced by a mapping that is evaluated at run-time."

Hidden state sequences are critical for modeling the non-stationarity of speech signals. We show that HCRFs can easily be trained using the simple direct optimization technique of stochastic gradient descent. We present the results on the TIMIT phone classification task and show that HCRFs outperforms comparable ML and CML/MMI trained HMMs. In fact, HCRF results on this task are the best single classifier results known to us. We note that the HCRF framework is easily extensible to recognition since it is a state and label sequence modeling technique. We also note that HCRFs have the ability to handle complex features without any change in training procedure."
