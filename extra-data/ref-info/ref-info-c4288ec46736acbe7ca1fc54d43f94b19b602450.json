Each approach has been devised for and/or evaluated using (usually small) application-specific datasets. While the need for objective performance evaluation of layout analysis algorithms is evident, there does not exist a suitable dataset with ground truth that reflects the realities of everyday documents (widely varying layouts, complex entities, colour, noise etc.). The most significant impediment is the creation of accurate and flexible (in representation) ground truth, a task that is costly and must be carefully designed. This paper discusses the issues related to the design, representation and creation of ground truth in the context of a realistic dataset developed by the authors. The effectiveness of the ground truth discussed in this paper has been successfully shown in its use for two international page segmentation competitions (ICDAR2003 and ICDAR2005)."

Complex layouts are supported as well as the flexible configuration of goal-oriented performance analysis scenarios. The comparison of segmentation results against the ground truth is performed in a very efficient way based on a decomposition of any region shape into an interval-based description. The framework has been validated using the dataset and method results of the ICDAR2005 Page Segmentation Competition."

This combination of tools and test data will allow anyone to conduct a meaningful test comparing the performance of competing page-reading algorithms. The value of this collection of software tools and test data is enhanced by knowledge of the past performance of several systems using exactly these tools and this data. These performance comparisons were published in previous ISRI Test Reports and are also provided. Another value is that the tools can be used to test the character accuracy of any page-reading OCR system for any language included in the Unicode standard. The paper concludes with a summary of the programs, test data, and documentation that is available and gives the URL where they can be located."
