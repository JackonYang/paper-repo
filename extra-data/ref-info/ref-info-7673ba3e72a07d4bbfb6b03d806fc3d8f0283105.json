                "text": "In this paper, we consider the table understanding task and present a catalogue of particular issues that arise when the tables are those found on the web. In addition, we consider what happens when processes commonly associated with web pages are applied to those bearing tables. 1 Table Understanding and the Web The ubiquity of tables, and their ability to describe relational information in a compact and immediate manner make them attractive targets for automated understanding. Recent research into the automatic location, recognition and understanding of tables has demonstrated the viability of integrating automated table processing systems into larger knowledge management applications ([8]). However, table understanding is still a relatively novel research area, one whose definition and terminology are still not fixed. It is useful to break the task down into some subtasks, and to consider them in turn with respect to the understanding of tables delivered on the web. Generally, table processing can be conceptualized as consisting of table location; table recognition; functional and structural analysis; and finally interpretation the extraction of meaningful and unambiguously structured information ([4]). We concentrate on the first two tasks in the following. location table location is the processes of spotting tables in documents. Traditionally, this task comes in two basic forms document image sourced tables ([7], [3]) and electronic text sourced tables including HTML ([1]). The problem is extended to include the spotting of tables in other document encodings such as postscript, pdf, rtf, word, etc. In general, when considering tables on the web, the appropriate HTML tags are exploited (TABLE, TH, TD, etc.). However, this is where we come to the first two distinguishing points. the presence of the TABLE tag in an HTML document does not necessarily indicate the presence of a table ([1] suggest less than 30 % of HTML TABLEs are real tables in one particular domain). there are many other ways in which tables may be presented in web delivered documents plain text (PRE), images, mixtures of table specific tags (TABLE, etc.) and tags used within the table for their functionality in terms of placing text spatially (PRE, LI, etc.) see Figure 1 for an example of such complexities. The first point requires the creation of accurate classification technology. Given any TABLE node in the HTML, the classifier must accept or reject it. Such a classifier may be built either via hand crafted rules ([1]) or using a machine learning approach. Experiments suggest that a machine learning approach using a naive bayse classifier ([9]) based on a feature set describing the set of tags below the potential TABLE node in the document tree produces adequate results. Locating tables encoded in other formats requires technology from other areas. For example, images of tables may be processed by techniques from the document image field ([2]), pre-formatted tables (using the PRE) tag may be processed using plain text table methods ([5]). However, the classification problem extends to these cases and individual classifiers must be constructed to make decisions about document elements of each type. The remaining outstanding issues relate to the mixture of encoding types (e.g. tables built out of TABLE nodes and pre-formatted elements), as well as the mixture of encoding purposes (e.g. the use of the HTML TABLE to encode surrounding text as well as an embedded table). Figure 1. A web page using a mixture of HTML tables (on the left) and images of tables (on the right). recognition table recognition is the task of segmenting the original description of the table into a relative spatial description. In general this task is required when the input is low-level, such as a document image or an electronic text. Clearly, if such tables are found on a web page, the same process is required. Again, given certain assumptions, we can take the marked up tables in a web page to be the logical spatial table. However, there are certain issues that need to be understood in order to account for certain variations: internal cell structure though tags like TH and TD may be assumed to delimit a single cell in the table, there are cases where other non-table tags are used to provide internal structure in such a way as to associate the cell\u2019s contents with those of other cells. A solution would be required to apply a certain amount of recursive processing working into the structure and building a unified abstract table. split cells in order to gain more control over the distribution of the text in a cell, authors occasionally split the text and place it in two or more adjacent cells. This problem may be accommodated by exploiting linguistic process as described in [6] where the content of the cell can be used to indicate continuity, if any, to other cells. errors spanning errors occur when the COLSPAN or ROWSPAN values are not correctly calculated. There are two cases. In the first the cell spans beyond the border of the intended table giving the cell incorrect coordinates. In the second, the span of the cell does not communicate the correct meaning of the cell. For example, a cell that is intended to span three cells below it spans only one leading to ambiguity. The first type of problem may be repaired by some form of normalization, whereas the second requires intelligent processing in order to distinguish the following two cases:"

The method proposed in this paper enables us to easily obtain information about similar objects scattered over the WWW. We focus on the tables contained in the WWW pages and propose a method to integrate them according to the category of objects presented in each table. The table integrated in a uniform format enables us to easily compare the objects of different locations and styles of expressions."

For example, www.campsearch.com allows complex queries by age, location, cost and specialty over summer camps. This functionality is not possible with general, Web-wide search engines. Unfortunately these portals are difficult and time-consuming to maintain. This paper advocates the use of machine learning techniques to greatly automate the creation and maintenance of domain-specific Internet portals. We describe new research in reinforcement learning, information extraction and text classification that enables efficient spidering, the identification of informative text segments, and the population of topic hierarchies. Using these techniques, we have built a demonstration system: a portal for computer science research papers. It already contains over 50,000 papers and is publicly available at www.cora.justresearch.com. These techniques are widely applicable to portal creation in other domains."

Techniques for locating matches to queries must therefore consider identification of probable collections as well as identification of documents that are probable answers. Further-more, the large amounts of data involved motivates the use of compression, but in a dynamic environment compression is problematic, because as new text is added the compression model slowly becomes inappropriate. In this paper we describe solutions to both of these problems. We show that use of centralised blocked indexes can reduce overall query processing costs in a multi-collection environment, and that careful application of text compression techniques allow collections to grow by several orders of magnitude without recompression becoming necessary."

There are two frequently used approaches to the development of intelligent agents using machine learning techniques: a content-based and a collaborative approach. In the rst approach, the content (eg., text) plays an important role, while in the second approach, the existence of several knowledge sources (eg., several users) is required. We can say that the usage of machine learning techniques on text databases (usually referred to as text-learning) is an important part of the content-based approach. Examples are agents for locating information on World Wide Web and Usenet news ltering agents. There are diierent research questions important for the development of text-learning intelligent agents. We focus on three of them: what representation is used for documents, how is the high number of features dealt with and which learning algorithm is used. These questions are addressed in an overview of the existing approaches to text classiication. For illustration we give a brief description of the content-based personal intelligent agent named Personal WebWatcher that uses text-learning for user customized Web browsing."

This approach clusters words into groups based on the distribution of class labels associated with each word. Thus, unlike some other unsupervised dimensionalityreduction techniques, such as Latent Semantic Indexing, we are able to compress the feature space much more aggressively, while still maintaining high document classification accuracy. Experimental results obtained on three real-world data sets show that we can reduce the feature dimensional&y by three orders of magnitude and lose only 2% accuracy-significantly better than Latent Semantic Indexing [6], class-based clustering [l], feature selection by mutual information [23], or Markov-blanket-based feature selection [13].

We focus on the robustness of these methods in dealing with a skewed category distribution, and their performance as function of the training-set category frequency. Our results show that SVM, kNN and LLSF signi cantly outperform NNet and NB when the number of positive training instances per category are small (less than ten), and that all the methods perform comparably when the categories are su ciently common (over 300 instances)."
