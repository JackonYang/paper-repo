Loose and textured clothing, occlusion and scene clutter make it a difficult problem because bottom-up segmentation and grouping do not always work. We address the problem of detecting humans from their motion pattern in monocular image sequences; extraneous motions and occlusion may be present. We assume that we may not rely on segmentation or grouping and that the vision front-end is limited to observing the motion of key points and textured patches in between pairs of frames. We do not assume that we are able to track features for more than two frames. Our method is based on learning an approximate probabilistic model of the joint position and velocity of different body features. Detection is performed by hypothesis testing on the maximum a posteriori estimate of the pose and motion of the body. Our experiments on a dozen of walking sequences indicate that our algorithm is accurate and efficient."

Mixtures-of-trees generalize the probabilistic trees of Chow and Liu (1968) in a different and complementary direction to that of Bayesian networks. We present efficient algorithms for learning mixtures-of-trees models in maximum likelihood and Bayesian frameworks. We also discuss additional efficiencies that can be obtained when data are \"sparse,\" and we present data structures and algorithms that exploit such sparseness. Experimental results demonstrate the performance of the model for both density estimation and classification. We also discuss the sense in which tree-based classifiers perform an implicit form of feature selection, and demonstrate a resulting insensitivity to irrelevant attributes."

We introduce the use of a novel mathematical technique, the product of exponential maps and twist motions, and its integration into a differential motion estimation. This results in solving simple linear systems, and enables us to recover robustly the kinematic degrees-of-freedom in noise and complex self occluded configurations. We demonstrate this on several image sequences of people doing articulated full body movements, and visualize the results in re-animating an artificial 3D human model. We are also able to recover and re-animate the famous movements of Eadweard Muybridge's motion studies from the last century. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computer vision based system that is able to process such challenging footage and recover complex motions with such high accuracy."

Within a Bayesian framework, we define a generative model of image appearance, a robust likelihood function based on image graylevel differences, and a prior probability distribution over pose and joint angles that models how humans move. The posterior probability distribution over model parameters is represented using a discrete set of samples and is propagated over time using particle filtering. The approach extends previous work on parameterized optical flow estimation to exploit a complex 3D articulated motion model. It also extends previous work on human motion tracking by including a perspective camera model, by modeling limb self occlusion, and by recovering 3D motion from a monocular sequence. The explicit posterior probability distribution represents ambiguities due to image matching, model singularities, and perspective projection. The method relies only on a frame-to-frame assumption of brightness constancy and hence is able to track people under changing viewpoints, in grayscale image sequences, and with complex unknown backgrounds."

We focus on a model where objects are represented as constellations of rigid features (parts). Variability is represented by a joint probability density function (PDF) on the shape of the constellation. In the first stage, the method automatically identifies distinctive features in the training set using an interest operator followed by vector quantization. The set of model parameters, including the shape PDF, is then learned using expectation maximization. Experiments show good generalization performance to novel viewpoints and unseen faces. Performance is above 90% correct with less than 1 s computation time per image."

Each part is represented using a simple appearance model and the deformable configuration is represented by spring-like connections between pairs of parts. While pictorial structures were introduced a number of years ago, they have not been broadly applied to matching and recognition problems. This has been due in part to the computational difficulty of matching pictorial structures to images. In this paper we present an efficient algorithm for finding the best global match of a pictorial stucture to an image. With this improved algorithm, pictorial structures provide a practical and powerful framework for quantitative descriptions of objects and scenes, and are suitable for many generic image recognition problems. We illustrate the approach using simple models of a person and a car."
