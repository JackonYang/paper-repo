                "text": "A theory of edge detection is presented. The analysis proceeds in two parts. (1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

In this paper we consider the problem of optimizing spatial frequency domain filters for detecting edges in digital pictures. The filter is optimum in that it produces maximum energy within a resolution interval of specified width in the vicinity of the edge. We show that, in the continuous case, the filter transfer function is specified in terms of the prolate spheroidal wave function. In the discrete case, the filter transfer function is specified in terms of the sampled values of the first-order prolate spheroidal wave function or in terms of the sampled values of an asymptotic approximation of the wave function. Both versions can be implemented via the fast Fourier transform (FFT). We show that the optimum filter is very effective for detecting blufred and noisy edges. Finally, we compare the performance of the optimum edge detection filter with other edge detection filters using a variety of input images."

                "text": "We use the facet model to accomplish step edge detection. The essence of the facet model is that any analysis made on the basis of the pixel values in some neighborhood has its final authoritative interpretation relative to the underlying grey tone intensity surface of which the neighborhood pixel values are observed noisy samples. Pixels which are part of regions have simple grey tone intensity surfaces over their areas. Pixels which have an edge in them have complex grey tone intensity surfaces over their areas. Specifically, an edge moves through a pixel if and only if there is some point in the pixel's area having a zero crossing of the second directional derivative taken in the direction of a non-zero gradient at the pixel's center. To determine whether or not a pixel should be marked as a step edge pixel, its underlying grey tone intensity surface must be estimated on the basis of the pixels in its neighborhood. For this, we use a functional form consisting of a linear combination of the tensor products of discrete orthogonal polynomials of up to degree three. The appropriate directional derivatives are easily computed from this kind of a function. Upon comparing the performance of this zero crossing of second directional derivative operator with Prewitt gradient operator and the Marr\u00e2\u20ac\"Hildreth zero crossing of Laplacian operator, we find that it is the best performer and is followed by the Prewitt gradient operator. The Marr-Hildreth zero-crossing of Laplacian operator performs the worst."

We illustrate the use of these constraints to carry out geometric interpretation of images up to the volumetric level. A general coincidence assumption is used to derive suggestive but incomplete interpretations for local features. A reasoning system is described which can use these suggestive hypotheses to derive consistent global interpretations, while maintaining the ability to remove the implications of hypotheses which are disproved in the face of further evidence. An important aspect of interpretation is the classification of image boundaries (intensity discontinuities) into those caused by geometric, reflectance, or illumination discontinuities. These interact with other hypotheses regarding occlusion by solid objects, the direction of illumination, aspects of object geometry, and the production of illumination discontinuities by geometric discontinuities. Although only a subset of the constraints and system design features have been implemented to date, we demonstrate the successful interpretation of some simulated image boundaries up to the volumetric level, including the construction of a three-space model."

A fundamental problem in computing such descriptions is scale: a derivative must be taken over some neighborhood, but there is seldom a principled basis for choosing its size. Scale-space filtering is a method that describes signals qualitatively, managing the ambiguity of scale in an organized and natural way. The signal is first expanded by convolution with gaussian masks over a continuum of sizes. This \"scale-space\" image is then collapsed, using its qualitative structure, into a tree providing a concise but complete qualitative description covering all scales of observation. The description is further refined by applying a stability criterion, to identify events that persist of large changes in scale."

The proof assumes that the filtered signal can be represented as a polynomial of finite, albeit possibly high, order. The result applies to zero and level crossings of linear differential operators of Gaussian filters. In this case the signal is determined uniquely, modulus the null space of the linear operator. The theorem can be extended to two-dimensional functions. These results are reminiscent of Logan\u2019s theorem [ Bell Syst. Tech. J.56, 487 ( 1977)]. They imply that extrema of derivatives at different scales are a complete representation of a signal. They are especially relevant for computational vision in the case of the Laplacian operator acting on image intensities, and they suggest rigorous foundations for the primal sketch."

The theoretical lower limit for the joint entropy, or uncertainty, of these variables is achieved by an optimal 2D filter family whose spatial weighting functions are generated by exponentiated bivariate second-order polynomials with complex coefficients, the elliptic generalization of the one-dimensional elementary functions proposed in Gabor's famous theory of communication [J. Inst. Electr. Eng. 93, 429 (1946)]. The set includes filters with various orientation bandwidths, spatial-frequency bandwidths, and spatial dimensions, favoring the extraction of various kinds of information from an image. Each such filter occupies an irreducible quantal volume (corresponding to an independent datum) in a four-dimensional information hyperspace whose axes are interpretable as 2D visual space, orientation, and spatial frequency, and thus such a filter set could subserve an optimally efficient sampling of these variables. Evidence is presented that the 2D receptive-field profiles of simple cells in mammalian visual cortex are well described by members of this optimal 2D filter family, and thus such visual neurons could be said to optimize the general uncertainty relations for joint 2D-spatial-2D-spectral information resolution. The variety of their receptive-field dimensions and orientation and spatial-frequency bandwidths, and the correlations among these, reveal several underlying constraints, particularly in width/length aspect ratio and principal axis organization, suggesting a polar division of labor in occupying the quantal volumes of information hyperspace.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Let there be given a sequence of ordinates \n \n$$ \\left\\{ {{y_n}} \\right\\}\\quad \\left( {n = 0, \\pm 1 \\pm 2, \\ldots } \\right), $$ \n \ncorresponding to all integral values of the variable x = n. If these ordinates are the values of a known analytic function F(x), then the problem of interpolation between these ordinates has an obvious and precise meaning: we are required to compute intermediate values F(x) to the same accuracy to which the ordinates are known. Undoubtedly, the most convenient tool for the solution of this problem is the polynomial central interpolation method. It uses the polynomial of degree k \u2014 1, interpolating k successive ordinates, as an approximation to F(x) only within a unit interval in x, centrally located with respect to its k defining ordinates. Assuming k fixed, successive approximating arcs for F(x) are thus obtained which present discontinuities on passing from one arc to the next if k is odd, or discontinuities in their first derivatives if k is even (see section 2.121). Actually these discontinuities are irrelevant in our present case of an analytic function F(x). Indeed, if the interpolated values obtained are sufficiently accurate, these discontinuities will be apparent only if we force the computation beyond the intrinsic accuracy of the y n."

These properties concern the relationship between the organizational principle of a two-dimensional anisotropic spatial filter or neural receptive field (such as elongation, or concatenation of subunits, or differential operators mediated by lateral inhibition in neural laminae) and the resulting general consequences for spatial frequency and orientation selectivity. These properties are demonstrated without assuming particular two-dimensional filter functional forms; rather, they are shown as general principles associated with certain broad categories of two-dimensional filters. Such an analysis enhance theoretical understanding of the two-dimensional receptive field organization of neurons in the visual cortex and permits the rejection of some candidate organizational principles on two-dimensional spectral grounds."

Since expert analysts must deal with very large, yet incomplete, data bases of unreliable facts about a complex world, the project would stringently test the applicability of Artificial Intelligence techniques. After a significant effort however, I am forced to the conclusion that an intelligent, real-world system of the kind envisioned is currently out of reach. Some of the difficulties were due to the size and complexity of the domain. As its true scale became evident, the available resources progressively appeared less adequate. The representation and reasoning problems that arose were persistently difficult and fundamental work is needed before the tools will be sufficient to engineer truly intelligent assistants. Despite these difficulties perhaps even because of them, much can be learned from the project. To assist further applications projects, I explain in this report some of the reasons for the negative result, and also describe some positive ideas that were gained along the way. In doing so, I hope to convey the respect I have developed for the complexity of real-world domains, and the difficulty of describing the ways experts deal them. (Author)"

Il est divis\u00e9 en quatre chapitres. Le premier chapitre \u00e9labore une technique d'approximation des applications diff\u00e9rentiables; les th\u00e9or\u00e8mes d\u00e9montr\u00e9s sont en quelque sorte une formulation diff\u00e9rentiable du th\u00e9or\u00e8me d'approximation simpliciale de la Topologie; gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 eux, toute la th\u00e9orie pourra \u00eatre \u00e9tablie sans faire appel au th\u00e9or\u00e8me de triangulation des vari\u00e9t\u00e9s diff\u00e9rentiables. Le chapitre II est consacr\u00e9 au probl\u00e8me de la r\u00e9alisation des classes d'homologie d'une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 par des sous-vari\u00e9t\u00e9s; on y obtient les r\u00e9sultats essentiels: En homologie mod 2, toutes le8 classes dont la dimension est inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la moiti\u00e9 de la dimension de la vari\u00e9t\u00e9 sont r\u00e9alisables par des sous-vari\u00e9t\u00e9s. En homologie enti\u00e8re, pour toute classe d'homologie z de la vari\u00e9t\u00e9 orientable V, il exi8te un entier non nul N tel que la classe multiple N\u00b7 z 80it r\u00e9alisable par une sousvari\u00e9t\u00e9. Le chapitre III applique les r\u00e9sultats pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents au probl\u00e8me de Steenrod: Toute classe d'homologie d'un poly\u00e8dre fini est-elle l'image de la classe fondamentale d'une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 1 On y montre que, Ri le probl\u00e8me admet une r\u00e9ponse affirmative en homologie mod 2, il existe au contraire, pour toute dimension ~ 7, des classes d'homologie enti\u00e8re qui ne sont l'image d'aucune vari\u00e9t\u00e9 diff\u00e9rentiable compacte. Le chapitre IV, enfin, est consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude des conditions pour qu'une vari\u00e9t\u00e9 soit une vari\u00e9t\u00e9-bord, et \u00e0 la classification des vari\u00e9t\u00e9s cobordantes. Ici encore, on obtient des r\u00e9sultats assez complets pour les classes \u00abmod 2\u00bb, sans condition d'orientabilit\u00e9. Par contre, je n'ai pu donner que des r\u00e9sultats fragmentaires pour les groupes Qk qui s'introduisent dans la classification des vari\u00e9t\u00e9s orient\u00e9es, \u00e0 cause de difficult\u00e9s alg\u00e9briques li\u00e9es en particulier au comportement des puissances de Steenrod dans la suite spec-"
