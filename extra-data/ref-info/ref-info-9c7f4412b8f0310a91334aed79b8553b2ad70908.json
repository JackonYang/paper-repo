IFBP is divided into three phases, Information Retrieval (IR), Information Extraction (IE) and Dictionary Construction (DC). We propose a query modification method using automatically constructed thesaurus for IR and a statistical keyword prediction method for IE. A dictionary of domain specific terms, which is one of the central knowledge sources for the task of knowledge acquisition, is also constructed automatically in the DC phase. IFBP is currently used for constructing the Transcription Factor DataBase (TFDB) and shows good performance. Since the model of knowledge base construction that is adopted into IFBP is carried out entirely automatically, this system can be easily ported across domains."

But since the amount of continuously updated knowledge on these interactions is massive and is only available in the form of published articles, an intelligent information extraction (IE) system is needed. To extract these information directly from articles, the system must firstly identify the material names. However, medical and biological documents often include proper nouns newly made by the authors, and conventional methods based on domain specific dictionaries cannot detect such unknown words or coinages. In this study, we propose a new method of extracting material names, PROPER, using surface clue on character strings. It extracts material names in the sentence with 94.70% precision and 98.84% recall, regardless of whether it is already known or newly defined."

This approach is well suited to learning in hypertext domains because its statistical component allows it to characterize text in terms of word frequencies, whereas its relational component is able to describe how neighboring documents are related to each other by hyperlinks that connect them. We evaluate our approach by applying it to tasks that involve learning definitions for (i) classes of pages; (ii) particular relations that exist between pairs of pages, and (iii) locating a particular class of information in the internal structure of pages. Our experiments demonstrate that this new approach is able to learn more accurate classifiers than either of its constituent methods alone."

The problem can be reduced to a manageable size by restricting attention to a specific {\\em domain}, which is a corpus of texts together with a predefined set of {\\em concepts} that are of interest to that domain. Two widely different domains are used to illustrate this domain-specific approach. One domain is a collection of Wall Street Journal articles in which the target concept is management succession events: identifying persons moving into corporate management positions or moving out. A second domain is a collection of hospital discharge summaries in which the target concepts are various classes of diagnosis or symptom. The goal of an information extraction system is to identify references to the concept of interest for a particular domain. A key knowledge source for this purpose is a set of text analysis rules based on the vocabulary, semantic classes, and writing style peculiar to the domain. This thesis presents CRYSTAL, an implemented system that automatically induces domain-specific text analysis rules from training examples. CRYSTAL learns rules that approach the performance of hand-coded rules, are robust in the face of noise and inadequate features, and require only a modest amount of training data. CRYSTAL belongs to a class of machine learning algorithms called covering algorithms, and presents a novel control strategy with time and space complexities that are independent of the number of features. CRYSTAL navigates efficiently through an extremely large space of possible rules. CRYSTAL also demonstrates that expressive rule representation is essential for high performance, robust text analysis rules. While simple rules are adequate to capture the most salient regularities in the training data, high performance can only be achieved when rules are expressive enough to reflect the subtlety and variability of unrestricted natural language."

                "text": "OF THE THESIS Information Extraction Using Hidden Markov Models by Timothy Robert Leek Master of Science in Computer Science University of California, San Diego, 1997 Professor Charles Peter Elkan, Chair This thesis shows how to design and tune a hidden Markov model to extract factual information from a corpus of machine-readable English prose. In particular, the thesis presents a HMM that classi es and parses natural language assertions about genes being located at particular positions on chromosomes. The facts extracted by this HMM can be inserted into biological databases. The HMM is trained on a small set of sentence fragments chosen from the collected scienti c abstracts in the OMIM (On-Line Mendelian Inheritance in Man) database and judged to contain the target binary relationship between gene names and gene locations. Given a novel sentence, all contiguous fragments are ranked by log-odds score, i.e. the log of the ratio of the probability of the fragment according to the target HMM to that according to a \\null\" HMM trained on all OMIM sentences. The most probable path through the HMM gives bindings for the annotations with precision as high as 80%. In contrast with traditional natural language processing methods, this stochastic approach makes no use either of part-of-speech taggers or dictionaries, instead employing non-emitting states to assemble modules roughly corresponding to noun, verb, and prepostional phrases. Algorithms for reestimating parameters for HMMs with non-emitting states are presented in detail. The ability to tolerate new words and recognize a wide variety of syntactic forms arises from the judicious use of \\gap\" states. v Chapter I Good Facts Are Hard to Find Finding facts in English prose is a task that humans are good at and computers are bad at. However, humans cannot stand to spend more than a few minutes at a time occupied with such drudgery. In this respect, nding facts is unlike a host of the other jobs computers are currently hopeless at, like telling a joke, riding a bike, and cooking a dinner. While there is no pressing need for computers to be good at those things, it is already of paramount importance that computers be pro cient at nding information with precision in the proliferating archives of electronic text available on the Internet and elsewhere. The state of the art in information retrieval technology is of limited use in this application. Standard boolean searching, vectorbased approaches and latent semantic indexing are geared more toward open-ended exploration than toward the targeted, detailed subsentence processing necessary for the fact nding or information extraction task. Since these approaches discard syntax, a large class of targets, in which the relationships between groups of words are important, must be fundamentally beyond them. The critical noun and verb groups of a fact can only be found by doing some kind of parsing. Information extraction is in most cases what people really want to do when they rst set about searching text, i.e. before they lower their sights to correspond to available tools. But this does not mean that nothing less than full-blown NLP (natural language processing) will satisfy. There are many real-world text searching 1 2 tasks that absolutely require syntactic information and yet are restricted enough to be tractable. An historian might want to locate passages in the Virginia colony records mentioning the \\event\" of a slave running away. The words slave, run, and away, all very common words, and their various synonyms used in an unconstrained search would return much dross. To nd this fact with precision we need to place constraints upon the arrangement of the words in the sentence; we need to limit the search with syntax. For instance, one might require that when two groups of words corresponding to slave and run appear in a sentence, that the slave is in fact the one doing the running. Similar examples of what we call fact searching are commonplace in most domains. A market analyst might want to scan the Wall Street Journal and pick out all mentions of corporate management changes. And a geneticist would be thrilled to be able to tease out of scienti c abstracts facts mapping genes to speci c locations on chromosomes. Historically, the eld of information extraction has employed discrete manipulations in order to process sentences into the critical noun and verb groups. An incoming sentence is tagged for part-of-speech and then handed o to a scaled-down parser or DFA (deterministic nite automaton) which uses local syntax to decide if the elements of a fact are present and to divide the sentence up into logical elements. Recent advances in statistical natural language processing have been applied to this problem but typically only in an ancillary role, e.g. in constructing dictionaries [17] and tagging words for part-of-speech [4]. The main processing engine remains combinatorial in avor. Systems like FASTUS [8] and CIRCUS [14] do surprisingly well, considering the di culty of the task, achieving precision and recall of better than 80%. But they require hand-built grammars or dictionaries of extraction patterns in order to attain this level of performance. A notable exception is the LIEP [9] system which learns to generalize extraction patterns from training examples. We have chosen to pursue a uni ed stochastic approach to the information extraction task, modeling sentence fragments containing the target fact with a hidden Markov model (HMM) which we use both to decide if a candidate sentence fragment 3 contains the fact and also to identify the important elements or slot llers in the fact. An HMM trained to recognize a small set of representative sentence fragments di ers radically from a DFA or discrete pattern matcher designed for the same task in that it outputs a probability. Unlike a DFA, an HMM will accept any sequence of words with non-zero probability. The probability it computes (after some corrections for sentence length and background frequencies of words) varies gracefully between the extremes of predicting extremely low probability for sequences that tend not to contain the fact to predicting high probability for ones that tend to contain it. There is no need, if we use an HMM to nd and process facts, to employ heuristics in order to rank and choose between competing explanations for a sentence; symbolic approaches often do so [9]. The probability the HMM computes is meaningful information we can use directly to reason about candidate facts in principled ways that submit to analysis. The HMM is a very compact and exible representation for the information extraction task which seems to be less reliant upon human engineering and prior knowledge than non-probabilistic approaches. This thesis will discuss our e orts to construct a model for a binary relationship between gene names and gene locations, as found in a variety of syntactic forms in scienti c abstracts. The model is structured hierarchically: at the top level states are collected into modules corresponding to noun or verb groups, whereas at the bottom level, in some cases, states function entirely deterministically, employing DFAs to recognize commonly occurring patterns. The HMM consists of only 64 states with an average of 3 transitions each, and explicitly mentions less than 150 words. When deploying the model to nd facts in novel sentences, no attempt is made to tag for part-of-speech. \\Gap\" states, which assign emission probability according to word frequency in the entire corpus, permit the HMM to recognize disconnected segments of a fact and tolerate new words. Unknown words, if they appear in the right local context, are accepted by the HMM essentially without penalty. So while the list of words likely to participate in forming a gene name or gene location is long and populated by words both common and rare to the corpus our approach is competent at correctly identifying even unknown words as 4 long as they appear anked by other words that serve to index the fact well. The accuracy of this HMM approach to information extraction, in the context of the gene name|location fact, is on par with symbolic approaches. This thesis is organized as follows. We begin with a description of the gene name|location information extraction task. Next, we present the modular HMM architecture constructed for this task, motivating our choice of null or background model and demonstrating the discriminatory power it adds to this approach. A brief technical discussion comes next, of the precise formulae used to reestimate parameters for an HMM with non-emitting states. Then we provide implementation and optimization details, followed by training and testing performance. We conclude with some remarks on the use of prior knowledge and ideas for future work. Chapter II Automatic Annotation Generation We consider the question of nding facts in unrestricted prose in the context of lling in slots in a database of facts about genes. The slots in the database correspond to biological entities. These are described by single words or simple phrases, three examples of which might be the name of a gene, some speci cation of its location, and some list of diseases in which it is known to be involved. An example pair of acceptable entries is SLOT ENTRY Gene Name: (The gene encoding BARK2) Gene Location: (mouse chromosome 5) which we might nd buried in a sentence like The gene encoding BARK2 mapped to mouse chromosome 5, whereas that encoding BARK1 was localized to mouse chromosome 19. This is valuable information that is available nowhere except in the published literature. Specialized databases like SwissProt and GenBank do not contain these kinds of associations. So there is interest in developing automated systems for lling in these slots. In order to populate these slots, we must locate and correctly analyze binary (or perhaps even ternary and higher) relations between likely ele"

Categorization of text is of increasing importance in information retrieval and natural language processing systems. Previous research on automated text categorization has mixed machine learning and knowledge engineering methods, making it diicult to draw conclusions about the performance of particular methods. In this paper we present empirical results on the performance of a Bayesian classiier and a decision tree learning algorithm on two text categorization data sets. We nd that both algorithms achieve reasonable performance and allow controlled tradeoos between false positives and false negatives. The stepwise feature selection in the decision tree algorithm is particularly eeective in dealing with the large feature sets common in text categorization. However, even this algorithm is aided by an initial preeltering of features, connrming the results found by Almuallim and Dietterich on artiicial data sets. We also demonstrate the impact of the time-varying nature of category deenitions."

The system is able to extract biological information directly from scientific literature in the form of MEDLINE abstracts. The criterion for selecting relevant keywords is the difference between their frequency in the abstracts associated with the protein family under study and its frequency in other unrelated protein families. The concept of functional information associated to protein families is the key feature of our system and gathers evolutionary information into the problem of functional annotation of biological sequences. The system has been tested in two different scenarios: first, a large set of protein families with a small number of abstract per family and second, selected protein families with large number of abstracts attached to each one. In both cases the performances are compared with annotations provided by human experts showing a clear relation between the amount of information provided to the system and the quality of the annotations. The automatic annotations are in many cases of similar quality to the ones contained in current data bases. The possibilities and difficulties to be encountered during the development of a full system for automatic annotation are discussed."

The purpose of the UMLS is to improve the ability of computer programs to \"understand\" the biomedical meaning in user inquiries and to use this understanding to retrieve and integrate relevant machine-readable information for users. Underlying the UMLS effort is the assumption that timely access to accurate and up-to-date information will improve decision making and ultimately the quality of patient care and research. The development of the UMLS is a distributed national experiment with a strong element of international collaboration. The general strategy is to develop UMLS components through a series of successive approximations of the capabilities ultimately desired. Three experimental Knowledge Sources, the Metathesaurus\u00ae, the Semantic Network, and the Information Sources Map have been developed and are distributed annually to interested researchers, many of whom have tested and evaluated them in a range of applications. The UMLS project and current developments in high-speed, high-capacity international networks are converging in ways that have great potential for enhancing access to biomedical information."

                "text": "Machine Learning is the study of methods for programming computers to learn. Computers are applied to a wide range of tasks, and for most of these it is relatively easy for programmers to design and implement the necessary software. However, there are many tasks for which this is difficult or impossible. These can be divided into four general categories. First, there are problems for which there exist no human experts. For example, in modern automated manufacturing facilities, there is a need to predict machine failures before they occur by analyzing sensor readings. Because the machines are new, there are no human experts who can be interviewed by a programmer to provide the knowledge necessary to build a computer system. A machine learning system can study recorded data and subsequent machine failures and learn prediction rules. Second, there are problems where human experts exist, but where they are unable to explain their expertise. This is the case in many perceptual tasks, such as speech recognition, hand-writing recognition, and natural language understanding. Virtually all humans exhibit expert-level abilities on these tasks, but none of them can describe the detailed steps that they follow as they perform them. Fortunately, humans can provide machines with examples of the inputs and correct outputs for these tasks, so machine learning algorithms can learn to map the inputs to the outputs. Third, there are problems where phenomena are changing rapidly. In finance, for example, people would like to predict the future behavior of the stock market, of consumer purchases, or of exchange rates. These behaviors change frequently, so that even if a programmer could construct a good predictive computer program, it would need to be rewritten frequently. A learning program can relieve the programmer of this burden by constantly modifying and tuning a set of learned prediction rules. Fourth, there are applications that need to be customized for each computer user separately. Consider, for example, a program to filter unwanted electronic mail messages. Different users will need different filters. It is unreasonable to expect each user to program his or her own rules, and it is infeasible to provide every user with a software engineer to keep the rules up-to-date. A machine learning system can learn which mail messages the user rejects and maintain the filtering rules automatically. Machine learning addresses many of the same research questions as the fields of statistics, data mining, and psychology, but with differences of emphasis. Statistics focuses on understanding the phenomena that have generated the data, often with the goal of testing different hypotheses about those phenomena. Data mining seeks to find patterns in the data that are understandable by people. Psychological studies of human learning aspire to understand the mechanisms underlying the various learning behaviors exhibited by people (concept learning, skill acquisition, strategy change, etc.)."

It effectively works by treating complex suffixes as compounds made up of simple suffixes, and removing the simple suffixes in a number of steps. In each step the removal of the suffix is made to depend upon the form of the remaining stem, which usually involves a measure of its syllable length."

The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty\u0097and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition\u0097in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability."

We describe a gene localization and modeling system, called GRAIL. GRAIL is a multiple sensor-neural network-based system. It localizes genes in anonymous DNA sequence by recognizing features related to protein-coding regions and the boundaries of coding regions, and then combines the recognized features using a neural network system. Localized coding regions are then \"optimally\" parsed into a gene model. Through years of extensive testing GRAIL consistently achieves about 90% of coding portions of test genes with a false positive rate of about 10% A number of genes for major genetic diseases have been located through the use of GRAIL, and over 1000 research laboratories worldwide use GRAIL on regular bases for localization of genes on their newly sequenced DNA."

Rules in the CTSHIV knowledge base encode knowledge about sequence mutations in the HIV genome that have been found to result in drug resistance in the HIV virus. Rules are applied to the actual HIV sequences of the virus strains infecting the specific patient undergoing clinical treatment in order to infer current drug resistance. A search through mutation sequence space identifies nearby drug resistant mutant strains that might arise. The possible drug treatment regimens currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are considered and ranked by their estimated ability to avoid identified current and nearby drug resistant mutants. The highest-ranked treatments are recommended to the attending physician. The result is more precise treatment of individual HIV patients, and a decreased tendency to select for drug resistant genes in the global HIV gene pool. The application is currently in use in human clinical trials on HIV patients. Initial results from a small clinical trial are encouraging and further clinical trials are planned. From an AI viewpoint the case study demonstrates the extensibility of knowledge-based systems because it illustrates how existing encoded knowledge can be used to support new applications that were unanticipated when the original knowledge was encoded."

This robust performance extends across a wide variety of comparison frameworks, including the optimization of metrics such as accuracy, expected cost, lift, precision, recall, and workforce utilization. In some cases, the performance of the hybrid can actually surpass that of the best known classifier. The hybrid is also efficient to build, to store, and to update.
