                "text": "We propose a method for detecting and describing features in medical images using deformable templates, for the purpose of diagnostic analysis of these features. The feature of interest can described by a parameterized template. An energy function is defined which links edges in the image intensity to corresponding properties of the template. The template then interacts dynamically with the image content, by evaluating the energy function and accordingly altering its parameter values. A gradient maximization technique is used to optimize the placement and shape of the deformable template to fit the desired anatomical feature. The final parameter values can be used as descriptors for the feature. Measurements of intensity values within a region of the template can be used as inputs to a medical diagnostic system. We have developed a Picture Archive and Communication System (PACS) based image analysis program which employs the technique of deformable templates to localize features in dual energy CT images. Measurements can then be automatically made which can be used for maintenance of patients suffering from bone loss and abnormal marrow fat content. This system has been successfully tested on 552 (69 \u00d7 8) images and is currently in use at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA. Statistical comparisons between the system and previously used manual techniques show that their performances are practically equivalent and that the system has several advantages over the human operator, for example, consistency, accuracy and cost."

We can identify perhaps thousands of faces learned throughout our lifetime and read facial expression to understand such subtle qualities as emotion. These skills are quite robust, despite sometimes large changes in the visual stimulus due to expression, aging, and distractions such as glasses or changes in hairstyle or facial hair. Computers which model and recognize faces will be useful in a variety of applications, including criminal identification, human-computer interface, and animation.

The limits of applicability of the algorithms are also traced by making the optical degradations more and more severe until the algorithms no longer succeed in their task.

Shih 2009-03-23 In the development of digital multimedia, the importance and impact of image processing and mathematical morphology are well documented in areas ranging from automated vision detection and inspection to object recognition, image analysis and pattern recognition. Those working in these ever-evolving fields require a solid grasp of basic fundamentals, theory, and related applications\u2014and few books can provide the unique tools for learning contained in this text. Image Processing and Mathematical Morphology: Fundamentals and Applications is a comprehensive, wide-ranging overview of morphological mechanisms and techniques and their relation to image processing. More than merely a tutorial on vital technical information, the book places this knowledge into a theoretical framework. This helps readers analyze key principles and architectures and then use the author\u2019s novel ideas on implementation of advanced algorithms to formulate a practical and detailed plan to develop and foster their own ideas. The book: Presents the history and state-of-the-art techniques related to image morphological processing, with numerous practical examples Gives readers a clear tutorial on complex technology and other tools that rely on their intuition for a clear understanding of the subject Includes an updated bibliography and useful graphs and illustrations Examines several new algorithms in great detail so that readers can adapt them to derive their own solution approaches This invaluable reference helps readers assess and simplify problems and their essential requirements and complexities, giving them all the necessary data and methodology to master current theoretical developments and applications, as well as create new ones."

The representation differs from established techniques in that the code elements are localized in spatial frequency as well as in space. Pixel-to-pixel correlations are first removed by subtracting a lowpass filtered copy of the image from the image itself. The result is a net data compression since the difference, or error, image has low variance and entropy, and the low-pass filtered image may represented at reduced sample density. Further data compression is achieved by quantizing the difference image. These steps are then repeated to compress the low-pass image. Iteration of the process at appropriately expanded scales generates a pyramid data structure. The encoding process is equivalent to sampling the image with Laplacian operators of many scales. Thus, the code tends to enhance salient image features. A further advantage of the present code is that it is well suited for many image analysis tasks as well as for image compression. Fast algorithms are described for coding and decoding."

We describe how a parallel analogue algorithm, derived from a formal model2\u20133 for the establishment of topographically ordered projections in the brain4\u201310, can be applied to the travelling salesman problem1,11,12. Using an iterative procedure, a circular closed path is gradually elongated non-uniformly until it eventually passes sufficiently near to all the cities to define a tour. This produces shorter tour lengths than another recent parallel analogue algorithm13, scales well with the size of the problem, and is naturally extendable to a large class of optimization problems involving topographic mappings between geometrical structures14."

The elastic net approach jointly minimizes the length of an arbitrary path in the plane and the distance between the path points and the cities. The tradeoff between these two requirements is controlled by a scale parameter K. A global minimum is found for large K, and is then tracked to a small value. In this paper, we show that (1) in the small K limit the elastic path passes arbitrarily close to all the cities, but that only one path point is attracted to each city, (2) in the large K limit the net lies at the center of the set of cities, and (3) at a critical value of K the energy function bifurcates. We also show that this method can be interpreted in terms of extremizing a probability distribution controlled by K. The minimum at a given K corresponds to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) Bayesian estimate of the tour under a natural statistical interpretation. The analysis presented in this paper gives us a better understanding of the behavior of the elastic net, allows us to better choose the parameters for the optimization, and suggests how to extend the underlying ideas to other domains."

Once the form of the model is specified it can be evaluated and the probability distribution of the parameters determined by statistical tests, given enough instances of the object. Specifying the imaging model and the matching criterion is often considerably harder. The way the object reflects light depends both on the reflectance function of the object, which in principle can be modeled, and on the scene illumination, which is usually unknown. The matching criterion, however, should aim to be relatively independent of the lighting conditions. An even more serious problem arises when part of the object is invisible, perhaps due to occlusion by another object or by lying in deep shadow. Most matching criteria will break down in this situation but recent work, described in the fourth section, shows promise of dealing with such problems. The plan of this chapter is as follows. The second section gives a simple introduction to deformable templates by describing the pioneering work of Fischler and Elschlager (1973) on extracting global descriptions of faces."

(1989), which attempts to extract the outline of a hand by assuming that the hand and the background have constant, though unknown, image intensities with superimposed gaussian noise. This approach attempts to explain the whole image and requires knowledge of the background as well as knowledge of the object being detected. In cases where knowledge of the background is unavailable the selfish template approach may be preferable. Selfish templates alone, however, might not be sufficient for giving a good image interpretation. Instead they might need to be supplemented by \u201caltruistic\u201d templates that attempt to explain the whole image. Although selfish templates try to match from the template to the image the altruistic templates try to match from the image to the templates. Thus some of the altruistic templates may be only partially matched. The use of residual analysis might provide a link between these two template types. The altruistic templates might try to explain the parts of the image unexplained by the selfish templates. The measures based on Robust Stat&tics enable the template to be matched even when part of it is occluded. Residual analysis may be able to isolate the occluder and describe it separately. By refining the imaging models and the robust measures of fit we expect to be able to reliably extract features from images of faces under a large variety of lighting conditions. Deformable templates were invented as a technique for doing computer vision and were not primarily motivated by considerations from psychological and neuroscientific experiments. Nevertheless there are some intriguing connections to such experiments, which we are currently investigating. The deformable templates themselves have some similarities to mental images (Kosslyn, 1980). In a slightly different vein they would suggest an initial representation of a face somewhat similar to a caricature though with more information. This representation, the description generated by the local and global deformable templates, would include peaks and valleys, in addition to edges, and the spatial relations between features. It is interesting that, though it is usually harder to recognize someone from a caricature than from a photograph, using caricatures can speed up reaction time for very familiar faces (Rhodes, Brennan, & Carey, 1987). The global face models might be related to the results of Haig (1984) on the sensitivity of observers to the spatial relations between features."
