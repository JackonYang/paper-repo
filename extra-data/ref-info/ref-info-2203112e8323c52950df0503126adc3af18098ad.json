A generative model, comprising of the human articulated structure, shape and clothing models, is used to formulate likelihood measures for evaluating solution candidates. We adopt a data-driven proposal mechanism for searching the solution space efficiently. We introduce the use of proposal maps, which is an efficient way of implementing inference proposals derived from multiple types of image cues.

Human pose is defined as the instantaneous two dimensional configuration (i.e. the projection onto the image plane) of a single articulated body in terms of the position of a predetermined sets of joints. First, statistical segmentation of the human bodies from the background is performed and low-level visual features are found given the segmented body shape. The goal is to be able to map these generally low level visual features to body configurations. The system estimates different mappings, each one with a specific cluster in the visual feature space. Given a set of body motion sequences for training, unsupervised clustering is obtained via the Expectation Maximization algorithm. For each of the clusters, a function is estimated to build the mapping between low-level features to 2D pose. Given new visual features, a mapping from each cluster is performed to yield a set of possible poses. From this set, the system selects the most likely pose given the learned probability distribution and the visual feature of the proposed approach is characterized using real and artificially generated body postures, showing promising results."

The basic approach is to store a number of exemplar 2D views of the human body in a variety of different configurations and viewpoints with respect to the camera. On each of these stored views, the locations of the body joints (left elbow, right knee, etc.) are manually marked and labelled for future use. The test shape is then matched to each stored view, using the technique of shape context matching in conjunction with a kinematic chain-based deformation model. Assuming that there is a stored view sufficiently similar in configuration and pose, the correspondence process will succeed. The locations of the body joints are then transferred from the exemplar view to the test shape. Given the joint locations, the 3D body configuration and pose are then estimated. We can apply this technique to video by treating each frame independently - tracking just becomes repeated recognition! We present results on a variety of datasets."

The main difficulties are the large appearance variations caused by action, clothing, illumination, viewpoint and scale. Our goal is to find people in static video frames using learned models of both the appearance of body parts (head, limbs, hands), and of the geometry of their assemblies. We build on Forsyth & Fleck's general 'body plan' methodology and Felzenszwalb & Huttenlocher's dynamic programming approach for efficiently assembling candidate parts into 'pictorial structures'. However we replace the rather simple part detectors used in these works with dedicated detectors learned for each body part using SupportVector Machines (SVMs) or RelevanceVector Machines (RVMs). We are not aware of any previous work using SVMs to learn articulated body plans, however they have been used to detect both whole pedestrians and combinations of rigidly positioned subimages (typically, upper body, arms, and legs) in street scenes, under a wide range of illumination, pose and clothing variations. RVMs are SVM-like classifiers that offer a well-founded probabilistic interpretation and improved sparsity for reduced computation. We demonstrate their benefits experimentally in a series of results showing great promise for learning detectors in more general situations."

We show how to find people by finding candidate body segments, and then constructing assemblies of segments that are consistent with the constraints on the appearance of a person that result from kinematic properties. Since a reasonable model of a person requires at least nine segments, it is not possible to inspect every group, due to the huge combinatorial complexity.We propose two approaches to this problem. In one, the search can be pruned by using projected versions of a classifier that accepts groups corresponding to people. We describe an efficient projection algorithm for one popular classifier, and demonstrate that our approach can be used to determine whether images of real scenes contain people.The second approach employs a probabilistic framework, so that we can draw samples of assemblies, with probabilities proportional to their likelihood, which allows to draw human-like assemblies more often than the non-person ones. The main performance problem is in segmentation of images, but the overall results of both approaches on real images of people are encouraging."

Monocular 3D body tracking is challenging: for reliable tracking at least 30 joint parameters need to be estimated, subject to highly nonlinear physical constraints; the problem is chronically ill conditioned as about 1/3 of the d.o.f. (the depth-related ones) are almost unobservable in any given monocular image; and matching an imperfect, highly flexible self-occluding model to cluttered image features is intrinsically hard. To reduce correspondence ambiguities we use a carefully designed robust matching-cost metric that combines robust optical flow, edge energy, and motion boundaries. Even so, the ambiguity, nonlinearity and non-observability make the parameter-space cost surface multi-modal, unpredictable and ill conditioned, so minimizing it is difficult. We discuss the limitations of CONDENSATION-like samplers, and introduce a novel hybrid search algorithm that combines inflated-covariance-scaled sampling and continuous optimization subject to physical constraints. Experiments on some challenging monocular sequences show that robust cost modelling, joint and self-intersection constraints, and informed sampling are all essential for reliable monocular 3D body tracking."

For known link (body segment) lengths, the strict nonobservabilities reduce to twofold 'forwards/backwards flipping' ambiguities for each link. These imply 2/sup # links/ formal inverse kinematics solutions for the full model, and hence linked groups of O(2/sup # links/) local minima in the model-image matching cost function. Choosing the wrong minimum leads to rapid mistracking, so for reliable tracking, rapid methods of investigating alternative minima within a group are needed. Previous approaches to this have used generic search methods that do not exploit the specific problem structure. Here, we complement these by using simple kinematic reasoning to enumerate the tree of possible forwards/backwards flips, thus greatly speeding the search within each linked group of minima. Our methods can be used either deterministically, or within stochastic 'jump-diffusion' style search processes. We give experimental results on some challenging monocular human tracking sequences, showing how the new kinematic-flipping based sampling method improves and complements existing ones."

We introduce a new algorithm that learns a set of hashing functions that efficiently index examples relevant to a particular estimation task. Our algorithm extends locality-sensitive hashing, a recently developed method to find approximate neighbors in time sublinear in the number of examples. This method depends critically on the choice of hash functions that are optimally relevant to a particular estimation problem. Experiments demonstrate that the resulting algorithm, which we call parameter-sensitive hashing, can rapidly and accurately estimate the articulated pose of human figures from a large database of example images."

Unlike previous approaches, the proposed reconstruction method does not assume that the imagery was acquired with a calibrated camera. An analysis is presented which demonstrates that there are a family of solutions to this reconstruction problem parameterized by a single variable. A simple and effective algorithm is proposed for recovering the entire set of solutions by considering the foreshortening of the segments of the model in the image. Results obtained by applying this algorithm to real images are presented."

Firstly, it realizes traditional \"hypothesis-and-test\" methods through well-balanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) dynamics, thus it achieves robust and globally optimal solutions. Secondly, it utilizes data-driven (bottom-up) methods in computer vision, such as Hough transform and data clustering, to design effective transition probabilities for Markov chain dynamics. This drastically improves the effectiveness of traditional MCMC algorithms in terms of two standard metrics: \"burn-in\" period and \"mixing\" rate. The article proceeds in three steps. Firstly, we analyze the structures of the solution space /spl Omega/ for object recognition. /spl Omega/ is decomposed into a large number of subspaces of varying dimensions in a hierarchy. Secondly, we use data-driven techniques to compute importance proposal probabilities in these spaces, each expressed in a non-parametric form using weighted samples or particles. Thirdly, Markov chains are designed to travel in such heterogeneous structured solution space, with both jump and diffusion dynamics. We use possibly the simplest objects-the \"/spl Psi/-world\" as an example to illustrate the concepts, and we briefly present results on an application of traffic sign detection."

The paper contributes to image segmentation in four aspects. First, it designs efficient and well-balanced Markov Chain dynamics to explore the complex solution space and, thus, achieves a nearly global optimal solution independent of initial segmentations. Second, it presents a mathematical principle and a K-adventurers algorithm for computing multiple distinct solutions from the Markov chain sequence and, thus, it incorporates intrinsic ambiguities in image segmentation. Third, it utilizes data-driven (bottom-up) techniques, such as clustering and edge detection, to compute importance proposal probabilities, which drive the Markov chain dynamics and achieve tremendous speedup in comparison to the traditional jump-diffusion methods. Fourth, the DDMCMC paradigm provides a unifying framework in which the role of many existing segmentation algorithms, such as, edge detection, clustering, region growing, split-merge, snake/balloon, and region competition, are revealed as either realizing Markov chain dynamics or computing importance proposal probabilities. Thus, the DDMCMC paradigm combines and generalizes these segmentation methods in a principled way. The DDMCMC paradigm adopts seven parametric and nonparametric image models for intensity and color at various regions. We test the DDMCMC paradigm extensively on both color and gray-level images and some results are reported in this paper."

This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \"integral image\" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a \"cascade\" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection."
