Different pairings of objects and scenes were used to produce three main contextual conditions: appropriate, inappropriate, and no context. Correct responses and confusions with visually similar objects depended strongly on both the contextual condition and the particular target object presented. The probability of being correct was highest in the appropriate context condition and lowest in the inappropriate context condition. Confidence ratings of responses were a function of the perceptual similarity between the stimulus object and the named object; they were not strongly affected by contextual conditions. Morton\u2019s (1970) \u201clogogen\u201d model provided a good quantitative fit to the response probability data."

In the first study, Ss searched five-letter displays for a predesignated critical letter. Both critical and noncritical letters could be repeated in the displays. Mean response latency decreased markedly with increasing redundancy in the critical letter and was affected to a lesser extent by redundancy in the noncritical letters. In the second study, Ss were required to detect the presence of redundant letters in displays of from two to five letters, first with no information as to what letter might be repeated, then with knowledge of which letter would be repeated if the display contained a redundant letter. Response latencies in the former case were much slower than in the latter. The implications of these findings for current views of visual information processing were discussed."

A brief tachistoscopic display of one or two single letters, four-letter common words, or four-letter nonwords was immediately followed by a masking field along with two single-letter response alternatives chosen so as to minimize informational differences among the tasks. Giving 5s response alternatives before the stimulus display as well as after it caused an impairment of performance. Performance on single words was clearly better than performance on single letters. The data suggest that the first stages of information processing are done in parallel, but scanning of the resultant highly processed information is done serially."

Display sizes in Experiment I were 8, 12, and 16 letters; in Experiment 2\u20131, 4, and 8 letters; on each trial S operated a key to indicate which member of a predesignated pair of letters (signal elements) was present in a given display. Correct response times, on the average, increased uniformly with display size. Incorrect response times were uniformly greater than correct response times and, except for a reduction in the case of one element displays, were constant over display size.

We consider this question in the context of a general independent-channels model that incorporates most existing models of order perception as special cases, and which has been implicitly assumed when temporal-order judgments are used to study perceptual latency. In the model, a \"decision function\" converts a difference in central \"arrival times\" of two sensory signals into an order judgment. The psychometric function for order is regarded as a distribution function, and can be represented additively in terms of the central arrival latencies and the decision function. Various distinct decision functions correspond to various previously proposed mechanisms involving a \"perceptual moment,\" attention switching, a threshold for arrival-time dif\u00ad ferences, and so forth (Section II). One test of the model is to compare reaction-time measurements with order judgments (Section III). Discrepancies can be understood by an analysis of the concept of perceptual latency that recognizes the internal response to a pulse as being spread out in time (Section IV). IA glossary of symbols and abbreviations may be found at the end of the text."

Of the several types of models considered in relation to previous studies, substantial support was forthcoming only for an independent stimulus sampling model. It is suggested that the detection method effects a relatively clear separation of the perceptual from the mnemonic aspects of the standard visual apprehension experiment, and that the sampling process may constitute only the first phase of a more general model which includes both parallel and serial information processing."

When two or more target characteristics were specified, fixations were generally based on a single characteristic.

For all three performance measures used, frequency of correct detections and correct and error latencies, strong interactions were obtained between all of the other variables and signal-noise confusability.

But even when we focus on an importanl sector of the field, we may not need to build a very elaborate structure for it. Details are detected only to the degree that they are essential for determining contents. As pointed out by Palmer (1975) and Norman and Bobrow (1976) and supported by much empirical evidence, perceptual processing must be both input-driven and concept-driven."

The model is a \"sophisticated guessing\" model which takes explicit account of the geometry of the characters which make up the words or letter strings. Explicit attempts are made to account for word frequency effects, effects due to letter transition probabilities, and effects due to physical similarity of character strings to one another. A word recognition experiment using the set of three-letter words is reported, and the model is used to make quantitative predictions of these results as well as to give a qualitative account for a number of results in the literature. Finally, it is shown that under certain simplifying assumptions this sophisticated guessing model is isomorphic with the \"criterion bias\" model as developed in 1967 by Broadbent. The process whereby words are recognized has long fascinated experimental psy-Several related findings have commanded the most attention. For example, more letters per unit time may be apprehended when a word is presented than when a string of unrelated letters is presented (Huey, 1908). A letter string formed by taking a word and either deleting or replacing one or two letters is often clearly perceived as that word (Pillsbury, 1897). Other things being equal, words which occur frequently in the language are more easily perceived than those which occur less frequently (Goldia-The more the statistics of letter strings approximate those of words, the better the perception of the letter strings (cf. Miller, Bruner, & Postman , 1954). The more predictable a word is within a sentence, the more easily it is Most explanations of these phenomena suggest that they all result from the fact that the subject combines internally provided information about language with externally provided information from the sensory system (cf. Morton, 1969, 1970). By this argument, words are easier to see than nonwords because we can apply our knowledge of the vocabulary of the language. Knowledge of relative frequencies of words in the language allows us to read high-frequency words more readily. Knowledge of syntactic and semantic relations allows us to read words more easily in the context of 99"

My prediction was that in such a situation subjects' performance will be insensitive to the figural identity of the local features. Perceptual awareness was measured by means of an indirect method: an intermodality Stroop task. Stroop tasks are named after Stroop (1935) who found that when subjects have to name the color of an ink in which a word is written, their responses are inhibited when the word is a name of color different from the ink color."
