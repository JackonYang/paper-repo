This paper describes some easily computable textural features based on gray-tone spatial dependancies, and illustrates their application in category-identification tasks of three different kinds of image data: photomicrographs of five kinds of sandstones, 1:20 000 panchromatic aerial photographs of eight land-use categories, and Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS) multispecial imagery containing seven land-use categories. We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery. These results indicate that the easily computable textural features probably have a general applicability for a wide variety of image-classification applications."

                "text": "What chiefly distinguishes cerebral cortex from other parts of the central nervous system is the great diversity of its cell types and inter-connexions. It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to CAT VISUAL CORTEX 107 the somatic sensory cortex of the cat and monkey in a remarkable series of studies by Mountcastle (1957) and Powell & Mountcastle (1959). Their results show that the approach is a powerful one, capable of revealing systems of organization not hinted at by the known morphology. In Part III of the present paper we use this method in studying the functional architecture of the visual cortex. It helped us attempt to explain on anatomical \u2026"

The textures are described using features derived from generalized co-occurrence matrices (GCM). A GCM is determined by a spatial constraint predicate F and a set of local features P = {(Xi, Yi, di), i = 1,..., m} where (Xi, Yi) is the location of the ith feature, and di is a description of the ith feature. The GCM of P under F, GF, is defined by GF(i, j) = number of pairs, pk, pl such that F(pk, pl) is true and di and dj are the descriptions of pk and pl, respectively. We discuss features derived from GCM's and present an experimental study using natural textures."

Since John Robson has more sense than I, he has done a lot of other things than studied ganglion cells. However, the fact remains that it was John's interest in the behavior of retinal ganglion cells which twenty years ago caused Fergus Campbell to \"ship John across the Atlantic\" to Northwestern University \"to dirty his fingers\" with visual neurophysiology. I owe Fergus Campbell much gratitude for having provided me with the opportunity and privilege to work with John, to keep him awake during nightly experiments by giving him frequent feedings and to make life almost intolerable for him by nagging about writing up the results. I hope that I have rendered visual sciences a small service by, in this way, having served as \"supportive tissue\" for John's brain. The introductory, very basic, comments on retinal ganglion cell characteristics which follow will, I hope, serve as a necessary background for John's quantitative description of cat ganglion cell behavior and also serve as a tribute to Ragnar Granit and Stephen Kuffler who laid the foundations for our knowledge of, and subsequent approach to, this fascinating subject."

In contrast, changes in the shape or orientation of these figures, which leave their component lines vertical and hlorizontal, do not reliably aid grouipinig.

This theory describes adaptive processes which overcome limitations of the visual uptake process to synthesize informative visual representations of the external world. The brightness data include versions of the Craik-O\u2019Brien-Cornsweet effect and its exceptions, Bergstrom\u2019s demonstrations comparing the brightnesses of smoothly modulated and step-like luminance profiles, Hamada\u2019s demonstrations of nonclassical differences between the perception of luminance decrements and increments, Fechner\u2019s paradox, binocular brightness averaging, binocular brightness summation, binocular rivalry, and fading of stabilized images and ganzfelds. Familiar concepts such as spatial frequency analysis, Mach bands, and edge contrast are relevant but insufficient to explain the totality of these data. Two parallel contour-sensitive processes interact to generate the theory\u2019s brightness, color, and form explanations. A boundary-contour process is sensitive to the orientation and amount of contrast but not to the direction of contrast in scenic edges. It generates contours that form the boundaries of monocular perceptual domains. The spatial patterning of these contours is sensitive to the global configuration of scenic elements. A feature-contour process is insensitive to the orientation of contrast, but is sensitive to both the amount of contrast and to the direction of contrast in scenic edges. It triggers a diffusive filling-in reaction of featural quality within perceptual domains whose boundaries are dynamically defined by boundary contours. The boundary-contour system is hypothesized to include the hypercolumns in visual striate cortex. The feature-contour system is hypothesized to include the blobs in visual striate cortex. These preprocessed monocular activity patterns enter consciousness in the theory via a process of resonant binocular matching that is capable of selectively lifting whole monocular patterns into a binocular representation of form-and-color-in-depth. This binocular process is hypothesized to occur in area V4 of the visual pre striate cortex."

                "text": "Abstract A theory is presented of how global visual interactions between depth, length, lightness, and form percepts can occur. The theory suggests how quantized activity patterns which reflect these visual properties can coherently fill-in, or complete, visually ambiguous regions starting with visually informative data features. Phenomena such as the Cornsweet and Craik\u2013O'Brien effects, phantoms and subjective contours, binocular brightness summation, the equidistance tendency, Emmert's law, allelotropia, multiple spatial frequency scaling and edge detection, figure-ground completion, coexistence of depth and binocular rivalry, reflectance rivalry, Fechner's paradox, decrease of threshold contrast with increased number of cycles in a grating pattern, hysteresis, adaptation level tuning, Weber law modulation, shift of sensitivity with background luminance, and the finite capacity of visual short term memory are discussed in terms of a small set of concepts and mechanisms. Limitations of alternative visual theories which depend upon Fourier analysis, Laplacians, zero-crossings, and cooperative depth planes are described. Relationships between monocular and binocular processing of the same visual patterns are noted, and a shift in emphasis from edge and disparity computations toward the characterization of resonant activity-scaling correlations across multiple spatial scales is recommended. This recommendation follows from the theory's distinction between the concept of a structural spatial scale, which is determined by local receptive field properties, and a functional spatial scale, which is defined by the interaction between global properties of a visual scene and the network as a whole. Functional spatial scales, but not structural spatial scales, embody the quantization of network activity that reflects a scene's global visual representation. A functional scale is generated by a filling-in resonant exchange, or FIRE, which can be ignited by an exchange of feedback signals among the binocular cells where monocular patterns are binocularly matched."
