In important special cases, such as the Hausdorff moment problem, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a maximum\u2010entropy solution and examine the convergence of the resulting sequence of approximations. A number of explicit illustrations are presented. In addition to some elementary examples, we analyze the maximum\u2010entropy reconstruction of the density of states in harmonic solids and of dynamic correlation functions in quantum spin systems. We also briefly indicate possible applications to the Lee\u2013Yang theory of Ising models, to the summation of divergent series, and so on. The general conclusion is that maximum entropy provides a valuable approximation scheme, a serious competitor of traditional Pade\u2010like procedures."

The Fredholm integral equation is converted to a generalized moment problem whose approximate solution by maximum\u2010entropy methods has been successfully implemented in a previous paper by Mead and Papanicolaou [L. R. Mead and N. Papanicolaou, J. Math. Phys. 25, 2404 (1984)]. Several explicit examples are given of approximate maximum\u2010entropy solutions of Fredholm integral equations of the first and second kinds and of the Wiener\u2013Hopf type.
