This involves a \"moderation\" of the most probable classifier's outputs, and yields improved performance. Second, it is demonstrated that the Bayesian framework for model comparison described for regression models in MacKay (1992a,b) can also be applied to classification problems. This framework successfully chooses the magnitude of weight decay terms, and ranks solutions found using different numbers of hidden units. Third, an information-based data selection criterion is derived and demonstrated within this framework."

The objective is to minimize the data requirement of learning. The authors choose a criterion for selecting training examples that works well in conjunction with the criterion used for learning, here, least squares. They proceed sequentially, selecting an example that, when added to the previous set of training examples and learned, maximizes the decrement of network squared error over the input space. When dealing with clean data and deterministic relationships, concise training sets that minimize the integrated squared bias (ISB) are desired. The ISB is used to derive a selection criterion for evaluating individual training examples, the DISB, that is maximized to select new exemplars. They conclude with graphical illustrations of the method, and demonstrate its use during network training. Experimental results indicate that training upon exemplars selected in this fashion can save computation in general purpose use as well."

The next query is chosen according to the principle of maximal disagreement. The algorithm is studied for two toy models: the high-low game and perceptron learning of another perceptron. As the number of queries goes to infinity, the committee algorithm yields asymptotically finite information gain. This leads to generalization error that decreases exponentially with the number of examples. This in marked contrast to learning from randomly chosen inputs, for which the information gain approaches zero and the generalization error decreases with a relatively slow inverse power law. We suggest that asymptotically finite information gain may be an important characteristic of good query algorithms."

This book is a complete guide to the C4.5 system as implemented in C for the UNIX environment. It contains a comprehensive guide to the system's use , the source code (about 8,800 lines), and implementation notes. The source code and sample datasets are also available on a 3.5-inch floppy diskette for a Sun workstation. \n \nC4.5 starts with large sets of cases belonging to known classes. The cases, described by any mixture of nominal and numeric properties, are scrutinized for patterns that allow the classes to be reliably discriminated. These patterns are then expressed as models, in the form of decision trees or sets of if-then rules, that can be used to classify new cases, with emphasis on making the models understandable as well as accurate. The system has been applied successfully to tasks involving tens of thousands of cases described by hundreds of properties. The book starts from simple core learning methods and shows how they can be elaborated and extended to deal with typical problems such as missing data and over hitting. Advantages and disadvantages of the C4.5 approach are discussed and illustrated with several case studies. \n \nThis book and software should be of interest to developers of classification-based intelligent systems and to students in machine learning and expert systems courses."

The single-output neuron is trained to be either a zero or a one. A test decision is made by thresholding the output at, for example, one-half. The set of inputs that produce an output of one-half forms the classification boundary. The authors adopted an inversion algorithm for the neural network that allows generation of this boundary. For each boundary point, the classification gradient can be generated. The gradient provides a useful measure of the steepness of the multidimensional decision surfaces. Conjugate input pairs are generated using the boundary point and gradient information and presented to an oracle for proper classification. These data are used to refine further the classification boundary, thereby increasing the classification accuracy. The result can be a significant reduction in the training set cardinality in comparison with, for example, randomly generated data points. An application example to power system security assessment is given."

These algorithms and variations on them have been the subject of numerous research papers since Quinlan introduced ID3. Until recently, most researchers looking for an introduction to decision trees turned to Quinlan's seminal 1986 Machine Learning journal article [Quinlan, 1986]. In his new book, C4.5: Programs for Machine Learning, Quinlan has put together a definitive, much needed description of his complete system, including the latest developments.

                "text": "Since, by (8) pertaining to the nearest neighbor decision rule (NN rule). We briefly review the NN rule and then describe the CNN rule. The NN rule['l-[ \" I assigns an unclassified sample to the same class as the nearest of n stored, correctly classified samples. In other words, given a collection of n reference points, each classified by some external source, a new point is assigned to the same class as its nearest neighbor. The most interesting t)heoretical property of the NN rule is that under very mild regularity assumptions on the underlying statistics, for any metric, and for a variety of loss functions , the large-sample risk incurred is less than twice the Bayes risk. (The Bayes decision rule achieves minimum risk but ,requires complete knowledge of the underlying statistics.) From a practical point of view, however, the NN rule is not a prime candidate for many applications because of the storage requirements it imposes. The CNN rule is suggested as a rule which retains the basic approach of the NN rule without imposing such stringent storage requirements. Before describing the CNN rule we first define the notion of a consistent subset of a sample set. This is a subset which, when used as a stored reference set for the NN rule, correctly classifies all of the remaining points in the sample set. A minimal consistent subset is a consistent subset with a minimum number of elements. Every set has a consistent subset, since every set is trivially a consistent subset of itself. Obviously, every finite set has a minimal consistent subset, although the minimum size is not, in general, achieved uniquely. The CNN rule uses the following algorithm to determine a consistent subset of the original sample set. In general, however, the algorithm will not find a minimal consistent subset. We assume that the original sample set is arranged in some order; then we set up bins called STORE and GRABHAG and proceed as follows. 1) The first sample is placed in STORE. 2) The second sample is classified by the NN rule, using as a reference set the current contents of STORE. (Since STORE has only one point, the classification is trivial at this stage.) If the second sample is classified correctly it is placed in GRABBAG; otherwise it is placed in STORE. 3) Proceeding inductively, the ith sample is classified by the current contents of \u2026"

Both quantitive and qualitative methods have been tried, but much of this work has been stymied by difficulties in acquiring appropriate lexical resources. The availability of this testing and training material has enabled us to develop quantitative disambiguation methods that achieve 92% accuracy in discriminating between two very distinct senses of a noun. In the training phase, we collect a number of instances of each sense of the polysemous noun. Then in the testing phase, we are given a new instance of the noun, and are asked to assign the instance to one of the senses. We attempt to answer this question by comparing the context of the unknown instance with contexts of known instances using a Bayesian argument that has been applied successfully in related tasks such as author identification and information retrieval. The proposed method is probably most appropriate for those aspects of sense disambiguation that are closest to the information retrieval task. In particular, the proposed method was designed to disambiguate senses that are usually associated with different topics."
