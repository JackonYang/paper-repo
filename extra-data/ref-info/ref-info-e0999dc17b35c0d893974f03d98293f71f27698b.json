The costs of implementation are linear in the length of data. Models can be nested to reflect hierarchical sources of knowledge. These and other desirable features have made hidden Markov methods increasingly attractive for problems in language, speech and signal processing. The basic ideas are introduced by elementary examples in the spirit of the Polya urn models. The main tool in hidden Markov modeling is the Baum-Welch (or forward-backward) algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters. This iterative algorithm is discussed both from an intuitive point of view as an exercise in the art of counting and from a formal point of view via the information-theoretic Q-function. Selected examples drawn from the literature illustrate how the Baum-Welch technique places a rich variety of computational models at the disposal of the researcher.<<ETX>>"

Another complication with Bayesian model averaging is that there may be so many possible models that averaging becomes intractable. In this case, we select one or a handful of structures with high relative posterior probabilities, and make our predictions with this limited set of models. This approach is called model selection. The trick here is nding a model or models with high posterior probabilities. Detailed discussions of search methods for model selection among PINs are given by (e.g.) Madigan and Raftery (1994), Heckerman et al. (1995), and Spirtes and Meek (1995). In the case where the true model is some HMM(K; J) structure, we may have additional prior knowledge that strongly constrains the possible values of K and J ."

This calculation can be achieved using a local propagation algorithm on the junction tree if one makes two modi cations to the standard JLO inference algorithm described above. This algorithm is due to Dawid (1992a) and as pointed out earlier this is the most general algorithm from a set of related methods."

Well-known examples of graphical models include Bayesian networks, directed graphs representing a Markov chain, and undirected networks representing a Markov field. These graphical models are extended to model data analysis and empirical learning using the notation of plates. Graphical operations for simplifying and manipulating a problem are provided including decomposition, differentiation, andthe manipulation of probability models from the exponential family. Two standard algorithm schemas for learning are reviewed in a graphical framework: Gibbs sampling and the expectation maximizationalgorithm. Using these operations and schemas, some popular algorithms can be synthesized from their graphical specification. This includes versions of linear regression, techniques for feed-forward networks, and learning Gaussian and discrete Bayesian networks from data. The paper concludes by sketching some implications for data analysis and summarizing how some popular algorithms fall within the framework presented. The main original contributions here are the decompositiontechniques and the demonstration that graphical models provide a framework for understanding and developing complex learning algorithms."

Three key issues of MAP estimation, namely, the choice of prior distribution family, the specification of the parameters of prior densities, and the evaluation of the MAP estimates, are addressed. Using HMM's with Gaussian mixture state observation densities as an example, it is assumed that the prior densities for the HMM parameters can be adequately represented as a product of Dirichlet and normal-Wishart densities. The classical maximum likelihood estimation algorithms, namely, the forward-backward algorithm and the segmental k-means algorithm, are expanded, and MAP estimation formulas are developed. Prior density estimation issues are discussed for two classes of applications/spl minus/parameter smoothing and model adaptation/spl minus/and some experimental results are given illustrating the practical interest of this approach. Because of its adaptive nature, Bayesian learning is shown to serve as a unified approach for a wide range of speech recognition applications. >"

We call these networks Boltzmann chains and show that they contain hidden Markov models (HMMs) as a special case. Our framework also motivates new architectures that address particular shortcomings of HMMs. We look at two such architectures: parallel chains that model feature sets with disparate time scales, and looped networks that model long-term dependencies between hidden states. For these networks, we show how to implement the Boltzmann learning rule exactly, in polynomial time, without resort to simulated or mean-field annealing. The necessary computations are done by exact decimation procedures from statistical mechanics."

This paper defines a version of these models, denoted as recursive exponential models, which have evolved by the desire to impose sophisticated domain knowledge onto local fragments of a model. Besides the structural knowledge, as specified by a given model, the statistical modelling may also include expert opinion about the values of parameters in the model. It is shown how to translate imprecise expert knowledge into approximately conjugate prior distributions. Based on possibly incomplete data, the score and the observed information are derived for these models. This accounts for both the traditional score and observed information, derived as derivatives of the log-likelihood, and the posterior score and observed information, derived as derivatives of the log-posterior distribution. Throughout the paper the specialization into recursive graphical models is accounted for by a simple example."

Wavelet-domain HMMs are designed with the intrinsic properties of the wavelet transform in mind and provide powerful, yet tractable, probabilistic signal models. Efficient expectation maximization algorithms are developed for fitting the HMMs to observational signal data. The new framework is suitable for a wide range of applications, including signal estimation, detection, classification, prediction, and even synthesis. To demonstrate the utility of wavelet-domain HMMs, we develop novel algorithms for signal denoising, classification, and detection."

An explicit 'causal' model is constructed for the process being observed, in which an acyclic directed graph is used to express conditional independence assumptions about variables, and probability assessments specify a full joint probability distribution. The resulting graphical structure can cope with a range of issues that arise in realistic modelling. Here we consider a particular example of assessing the chance that a suspected adverse reaction is due to a particular drug under suspicion. The background biological knowledge provides an appropriate model and probability assessments are obtained from expert microbiologists. The model allows a variety of interpretations for \u2018causality\u2019. Details of the graphical and computational algorithms used to perform efficient calculations of conditional probabilities on complex graphical structures are provided and illustrated with the example. Further developments should allow updating of the risk parameters in the light of a series of case reports, and may form the basis for a flexible expert system for causality assessment and post-marketing surveillance."

Basic concepts for learning and Bayesian networks are introduced and methods are then reviewed.

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

In this paper, the Bayesian approach to regularization and model-comparison is demonstrated by studying the inference problem of interpolating noisy data. The concepts and methods described are quite general and can be applied to many other data modeling problems. Regularizing constants are set by examining their posterior probability distribution. Alternative regularizers (priors) and alternative basis sets are objectively compared by evaluating the evidence for them. Occam's razor is automatically embodied by this process. The way in which Bayes infers the values of regularizing constants and noise levels has an elegant interpretation in terms of the effective number of parameters determined by the data set. This framework is due to Gull and Skilling."

The approach most used currently is a stepwise strategy guided by tests based on approximate asymptotic P values leading to the selection of a single model; inference is then conditional on the selected model. The sampling properties of such a strategy are complex, and the failure to take account of model uncertainty leads to underestimation of uncertainty about quantities of interest. In principle, a panacea is provided by the standard Bayesian formalism that averages the posterior distributions of the quantity of interest under each of the models, weighted by their posterior model probabilities. Furthermore, this approach is optimal in the sense of maximizing predictive ability. But this has not been used in practice, because computing the posterior model probabilities is hard and the number of models is very large (often greater than 1..."

The author provides a coherent explication of probability as a language for reasoning with partial belief and offers a unifying perspective on other AI approaches to uncertainty, such as the Dempster-Shafer formalism, truth maintenance systems, and nonmonotonic logic. The author distinguishes syntactic and semantic approaches to uncertainty\u0097and offers techniques, based on belief networks, that provide a mechanism for making semantics-based systems operational. Specifically, network-propagation techniques serve as a mechanism for combining the theoretical coherence of probability theory with modern demands of reasoning-systems technology: modular declarative inputs, conceptually meaningful inferences, and parallel distributed computation. Application areas include diagnosis, forecasting, image interpretation, multi-sensor fusion, decision support systems, plan recognition, planning, speech recognition\u0097in short, almost every task requiring that conclusions be drawn from uncertain clues and incomplete information. \nProbabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems will be of special interest to scholars and researchers in AI, decision theory, statistics, logic, philosophy, cognitive psychology, and the management sciences. Professionals in the areas of knowledge-based systems, operations research, engineering, and statistics will find theoretical and computational tools of immediate practical use. The book can also be used as an excellent text for graduate-level courses in AI, operations research, or applied probability."

It is shown that, in regression, when there are many candidate independent variables, standard variable selection procedures can give very misleading results. Also, by selecting a single model, they ignore model uncertainty and so underestimate the uncertainty about quantities of interest. The Bayesian approach to hypothesis testing, model selection, and accounting for model uncertainty is presented. Implementing this is straightforward through the use of the simple and accurate BIC approximation, and it can be done using the output from standard software. Specific results are presented for most of the types of model commonly used in sociology. It is shown that this approach overcomes the difficulties with P-values and standard model selection procedures based on them. It also allows easy comparison of nonnested models, and permits the quantification of the evidence for a null hypothesis of interest, such as a convergence theory or a hypothesis about societal norms."

(1993) and an algorithm that has been well known in the artificial intelligence community for a decade, but which is relatively unknown to information theorists: Pearl's (1982) belief propagation algorithm. We see that if Pearl's algorithm is applied to the \"belief network\" of a parallel concatenation of two or more codes, the turbo decoding algorithm immediately results. Unfortunately, however, this belief diagram has loops, and Pearl only proved that his algorithm works when there are no loops, so an explanation of the experimental performance of turbo decoding is still lacking. However, we also show that Pearl's algorithm can be used to routinely derive previously known iterative, but suboptimal, decoding algorithms for a number of other error-control systems, including Gallager's (1962) low-density parity-check codes, serially concatenated codes, and product codes. Thus, belief propagation provides a very attractive general methodology for devising low-complexity iterative decoding algorithms for hybrid coded systems."

The methods display certain novel aspects geared specifically towards the efficient analysis of lattice heteropolymer models at low temperatures. However, the general principles are in fact extremely general in scope, and can be applied also to problems at arbitrary temperatures, to homopolymers and RNA molecules, to sequence analysis issues such as inverse folding and sequence alignment, and to other discrete global optimization problems. Special importance is laid upon the need to measure in detail the structural characteristics of as large a number as possible of the low-energy states of heteropolymer models in order to understand their folding properties, as opposed to simply locating the slate of globally minimal energy (or locally minimal energy). In this way fundamental questions concerning the relevance of thermodynamic barriers in the models can be addressed.<<ETX>>"

Speakers can, and typically do, tune their performance according to communicative and situational demands, controlling the interplay between production-oriented factors on the one hand, and output-oriented constraints on the other. For the ideal speaker, H&H claims that such adaptations reflect his tacit awareness of the listener\u2019s access to sources of information independent of the signal and his judgement of the short-term demands for explicit signal information. Hence speakers are expected to vary their output along a continuum of hyper- and hypospeech. The theory suggests that the lack of invariance that speech signals commonly exhibit (Perkell and Klatt 1986) is a direct consequence of this adaptive organization (cf MacNeilage 1970). Accordingly, in the H&H program the quest for phonetic invariance is replaced by another research task: Explicating the notion of sufficient discriminability and defining the class of speech signals that meet that criterion."

                "text": "Volume 1: From Brownian Motion to Renormalization and Lattice Gauge Theory. Volume 2: Strong Coupling, Monte Carlo Methods, Conformal Field Theory, and Random Systems. This two-volume work provides a comprehensive and timely survey of the application of the methods of quantum field theory to statistical physics, a very active and fruitful area of modern research. The first volume provides a pedagogical introduction to the subject, discussing Brownian motion, its anticommutative counterpart in the guise of Onsager's solution to the two-dimensional Ising model, the mean field or Landau approximation, scaling ideas exemplified by the Kosterlitz-Thouless theory for the XY transition, the continuous renormalization group applied to the standard phi-to the fourth theory (the simplest typical case) and lattice gauge theory as a pathway to the understanding of quark confinement in quantum chromodynamics. The second volume covers more diverse topics, including strong coupling expansions and their analysis, Monte Carlo simulations, two-dimensional conformal field theory, and simple disordered systems. The book concludes with a chapter on random geometry and the Polyakov model of random surfaces which illustrates the relations between string theory and statistical physics. The two volumes that make up this work will be useful to theoretical physicists and applied mathematicians who are interested in the exciting developments which have resulted from the synthesis of field theory and statistical physics."

                "text": "By a recursive method numerically exact free energies are calculated for square $L\\ifmmode\\times\\else\\texttimes\\fi{}L$ Ising lattices, with $6l~Ll~18$, for several kinds of frozen-in bond disorder: (i) bonds $\\ifmmode\\pm\\else\\textpm\\fi{}J$ with various concentrations of negative bonds; (ii) bonds distributed according to a Gaussian distribution. Ground states of these systems are identified, the response to \"ordering fields\" is studied, and the correlation function ${\u3008{S}_{0}{S}_{R}\u3009}_{T}^{2}$ is calculated as a function of temperature for various distances $R$ in the lattice. This correlation is found to decay strongly (presumably exponentially) with increasing $R$ even at temperatures distinctly below the apparent freezing temperature ${T}_{f}$ of previous Monte Carlo simulations; this \"freezing transition\" is hence unambiguously identified as a nonequilibrium effect. However, the correlation length is found to become long ranged at low temperatures, and it is suggested that a phase transition still occurs at $T=0$; while in the Gaussian model the spin-glass order parameter $q(T=0)=1$, it is found that $q\\ensuremath{\\equiv}0$ in the $\\ifmmode\\pm\\else\\textpm\\fi{}J$ model where rather a power-law decay of correlations ${\u3008{S}_{0}{S}_{R}\u3009}_{T=0}^{2}$ occurs. Performing Monte Carlo simulations for precisely the same systems, the cooling times necessary to reach the true ground states of the system are identified, as well as the simulation times necessary to reach thermal equilibrium for the correlation functions. These times are found to increase so strongly with $L$ that for systems of macroscopic size the correct thermal equilibrium is probably irrelevant for experimental purposes. Rather a statistical mechanics based on the many long-lived metastable states would be required."

Previous articulatory studies of similar hypotheses, expressed entirely in articulatory terms, have been confounded by interdependencies of the variables being studied (e.g., lip and mandible displacements). One case in which this problem may be minimized is that of lip rounding and tongue-body raising (formation of a velo-palatal constriction) for the vowel /u/. Lip rounding and tongue-body raising should have similar acoustic effects for /u/, mainly to lower F2. In multiple repetitions, reciprocal contributions of lip rounding and tongue-body raising could help limit F2 variability for /u/; thus this experiment looked for complementary covariation (negative correlations) in measures of these two parameters. An electro-magnetic midsagittal articulometer (EMMA) was used to track movements of midsagittal points on the tongue body, upper and lower lips, and mandible for large numbers of repetitions of utterances containing /u/. (Interpretation of the data was aided by results from area-function-to-formant modeling.) Three of four subjects showed weak negative correlations, tentatively supporting the hypothesis; a fourth showed the opposite pattern: positive correlations of lip rounding and tongue raising. The results are discussed with respect to ideas about motor equivalence, the nature of speech motor programming, and potential improvements to the paradigm."
