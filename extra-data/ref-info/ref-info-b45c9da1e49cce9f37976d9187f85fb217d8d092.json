Many attempts to measure the bandwidths of these mechanisms using subthreshold summation have yielded estimates suggesting very narrow frequency tuning. We have measured thresholds for three classes of stimuli: gratings containing two sinusoidal components, sums of \"difference of Gaussian\" (DOG) patterns, and square waves. The results of the subthreshold summation experiments with gratings are consistent with those of other studies. All of these thresholds can be predicted by a model requiring only four center-surround-type mechanisms at each retinal locus. These mechanisms have a full bandwidth at a half-height of about 1.75 octaves. Quantitative prediction of sensitivities depends critically upon spatial probability summation. It is this spatial nonlinearity that yields these somewhat conterintuitive results. The much narrower bandwidths inferred by others are due to the assumption of linearity used in their analyses."

Although the vector-magnitude model is quite different from the probability-summation model which has been suggested previously, the contrast thresholds and psychometric functions predicted by the two models can be in agreement within 10% for up to 105 channels in the system. Presently available experimental evidence is insufficient to establish the correctness of either model, but the computational simplicity of the vector-magnitude model makes it interesting, if only as a useful approximation to the probability-summation model."

Results were used to test the hypothesis that the two components of a complex grating may be detected independently. In an extensive experiment with f = 14 cycles/deg, the independence hypothesis was consistently rejected only when f/f\u2032=54 or 45, but rarely rejected when the value of f/f\u2032 lay outside this range. In other experiments, f was between 1.9 and 22.4 cycles/deg. All results are compatible with the assumption that the human visual system contains sensory channels, each selectively sensitive to different narrow ranges of spatial frequencies, whose outputs are detected independently."

Masking functions were obtained while varying the grating frequency relative to various one-octave-wide bands of noise. These functions closely resemble curves derived from previous experiments on adaptation to gratings. Masking was also measured as a function of the width of a band of noise centered on the grating frequency. Masking increased as the band was widened up to approximately \u00b11 octave; masking did not increase further when the band was widened beyond this range. The results demonstrate that a grating is masked only by noise whose spatial frequencies are similar to the grating frequency. The experiments provide further indication of the existence of channels in the visual system that are selectively tuned to different spatial frequencies."

                "text": "1. The visibility of composite stimuli (double lines, multiple lines and sinusoidal gratings) is analysed in terms of the visibility of single lines. 2. The detection mechanisms for the composite stimuli were examined by measuring the probabilities for seeing these stimuli, the probabilites of \"recognition\" near their detection thresholds and by using the method of subthreshold summation. 3. The simplest composite stimulus consists of two lines spaced apart by 15 min; it was found that both the probability of seeing this stimulus and the probability of reporting either one or two lines may largely be explained by assuming independent detection of the two lines. For a 12 min spacing some antagonistic interaction was observed between the two lines, confirming the existence of an antagonistic surround in the line detector. 4. The probability of seeing a multiple line target (rectangular grating) of spacing 15 min is slightly greater than that predicted assuming independent detection of its component lines; this probability can be calculated from the probabilities of seeing a central line (near the fixation point) and pairs of lines spaced 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 min on either side of the fixation point. The observed threshold for the grating was about 0.05 log units less than the prediction. 5. The probability that a subject reports only one line from a rectangular grating was found to be consistent with independent detection of its component lines when the subject used a low (detection) threshold criterion but not for higher criteria. 6. The spatial frequencies involved in the detection of the rectangular grating were determined by subthreshold summation; the high spatial frequency selectivity was shown to be consistent with independent detection of the component lines. 7. The detection mechanism for a 4 c/deg sinusoidal grating was found to be similar to that for the 15 min rectangular grating. 8. Evidence is presented that the detection of finer and coarser gratings may be analysed in similar terms. 9. It is shown that lines are not detected by independent activation of sharply tuned grating detectors but that sub\u2010units may be involved which are slightly more narrowly tuned than the line detector. 10. These sub\u2010units contain both inhibitory and disinhibitory regions; the disinhibitory responses may be the basis of the deviations from probability summation noted in 4. 11. The properties of the proposed sub\u2010units are in reasonable accord with the results of adaptation experiments."

We confirm Keesey's (1972) observation that, when a flickering line is viewed, there are distinct thresholds for detecting flicker (or movement) and for detecting a well localized line (pattern detection). Our measurements of the temporal sensitivity of these two mechanisms are similar to Keesey's. 2. The flicker and pattern detection mechanism have been analysed using subthreshold summation, i.e. by observing the effect of subthreshold flickering stimuli (lines and gratings) on the contrast threshold for a flickering test line. 3. The pattern detector shows linear spatial summation of contrast while the flicker detector is non\u2010linear in this respect. 4. The receptive field of the (most sensitive) flicker detector is about two to four times broader than that of the pattern detector. 5. The flicker detector has relatively weak surround inhibition and so, unlike the pattern detector, it is sensitive to a uniform flickering field. 6. The spatial arrangement of the pattern detector is the same at all temporal frequencies (including steady presentation); for flicker detection, the width of the receptive field increases with temporal frequency and the strength of lateral inhibition decreases at high frequencies. 7. Flicker detectors of various widths were demonstrated by using different test stimuli (for 12 Hz modulation); surround ingibition was relatively weak for the broadest detector. 8. There is a delay of surround inhibition of about 3 ms for both flicker and pattern detection. 9. By using a broad test stimulus modulated at a high frequency, a detector can be found with no significant surround inhibition. At threshold, this stimulus produces a sensation of flicker without the appearance of lateral motion observed for finer test lines at lower frequencies. 10. The characteristics of pattern and flicker (movement) detection are compared to electrophysiological studies on X (sustained) and Y (transient) neurones respectively, and correlations are described for studies of temporal frequency response, non\u2010linearity, width of receptive field, strength of the inhibitory surround and motion sensitivity."

One type of rod bipolar cell and two types of cone bipolar cell are recognized. The rod bipolar is exclusively connected to rods. The midget bipolar is postsynaptic to only one cone but each cone is also presynaptic to a diffuse cone (flat) bipolar. Such flat bipolar cells are in synaptic relationship with about seven cones. No other bipolar cell types have been found. The brush bipolar of Polyak is interpreted as probably a distorted rod bipolar, while Polyak's centrifugal bipolar is a misinterpretation of the morphology of diffuse amacrine cells. When presumptive centrifugal bipolars were observed they appeared to be a developmental stage of amacrine cells. In the outer plexiform layer two types of horizontal cell have been defined. Each type of horizontal cell has a single axon and two kinds of horizontal cell axon terminals are recognized. In the inner plexiform layer there are two main classes of amacrine cells: the stratified amacrines and the diffuse amacrines. Each class of amacrine has a wide variety of shapes. Polyak's midget ganglion cell is confirmed and his five other kinds of ganglion cell are classified into diffuse and stratified ganglion cells according to the level at which their dendrites branch within the inner plexiform layer. A fuller summary is given by the diagram and in the legend of figure 98, p. 174. A new type of midget bipolar is described in the Appendix (p. 177)."

                "text": "NOTES AND DISCUSSIONS THE STAIRCASE-METHOD IN PSYCHOPHYSICS A psychophysical method variously referred to as the method of up and downs, 1 the Bekesy audiometric method, 2 or the staircase-method, has come into extensive use in the last few years. The method has several advantages over other more commonly used techniques but it also has some disadvantages. This paper will illustrate the use of the method, will discuss its relative merits and demerits, and will describe a modification which overcomes certain of the disadvantages of the method. The staircase-method is best described by illustrating its use with a specific prob- lem. Suppose the problem is to determine S's absolute, intensive threshold for the sound of a click. The first stimulus that E delivers is a click of some arbitrary intensity. S responds either that he did or did not hear it. If S says 'yes' (he did hear it), the next stimulus is made less intense, and if S says 'no,' the second stimulus is made more intense. If S responds 'yes' to the second stimulus, the third is made less intense, and if he says 'no,' it is made more intense. This procedure is simply continued until some predetermined criterion or 'number of trials' is reached. The results of a series of 30 trials are shown in Fig. 1. The results may be recorded directly on graph-paper; doing so helps E keep the procedure straight. There are a number of ways of determining the intensive value that represents the threshold. The simplest is to compute the mean of the values of a given num- ber of stimuli delivered after the series has reached its final level. This requires an arbitrary decision about when the final level has been reached. The technique, which avoids this difficulty and yields a 50% value, is simply to determine the stimulus above which 50% of the responses are 'yes,'-i.e. in Fig. 1 between 61 and 62 db. Statistical treatment of the results has been discussed by Dixon and Massey, who describe the techniques for determining the means, standard deviations, standard errors, etc., for this type of data.3 The treatments assume, however, that the response to each stimulus is independent of the preceding stimuli and pre- ceding responses. This assumption holds for the examples analyzed, but there is evidence that the assumption does not always hold for human Ss in psychophysical experiments.\u2022 The development of techn.iques that take the existing inter-actions into account has not as yet been achieved.

                "text": "Lloyds Bank has its main root in a substantial private bank founded in Birmingham nearly two centuries ago; one hundred years ago this Bank still had only the one office in Birmingham, with a related private banking house in Lombard Street. But by amalgamation it has absorbed scores of other eighteenth and nineteenth century banks, both private and joint-stock, and at least two of the former reach back into Restoration London, perhaps Cromwellian London. Although the records of these historic businesses have been gravely impaired, especially by bombing in 1940-41, the Bank still possesses rich material for the economic and social historian. This material has been at the disposal of Professor R. S. Sayers and, though the gaps in the records have prevented him from presenting a full and systematic history of the Bank, he presents in this book a picture of English banking development as illustrated in the records of Lloyds Bank."
