The calculated retinal transfer functions display a nontrivial coupling between color and spatiotemporal processing even when the autocorrelator of natural scenes has no coupling between the chro\u00acmatic and the space-time dimensions. This coupling in the transfer function is fundamentally due to photoreceptor noise, and where red and green cone activities are highly correlated, as they are in humans and monkeys, it leads to the spatio\u00actemporal-chromatic opponent ganglion cells found in primates. Ignoring the blue cones, we find two types of ganglion cells whose receptive field organization is either red center with a green surround or green center with a red surround, as found by Derrington et al. [4] in monkeys. On the other hand, when the correlation between the red and green cone outputs is small, as is the case in shallow fresh water fish, we arrive at the \"double opponency\" cells observed in goldfish. We also argue that adding blue cones (which are rare) leads to a third type of cell with R + G \u2014 B opponency."

We argue that the retinal goal is to transform the visual input as much as possible into a statistically independent basis as the first step in creating a redundancy reduced representation in the cortex, as suggested by Barlow. The extent of this whitening of the input is limited, however, by the need to suppress input noise. Our explicit theoretical solutions for the retinal filters also show a simple dependence on mean stimulus luminance: they predict an approximate Weber law at low spatial frequencies and a De Vries-Rose law at high frequencies. Assuming that the dominant source of noise is quantum, we generate a family of contrast sensitivity curves as a function of mean luminance. This family is compared to psychophysical data."

The theory is formulated in the language of information theory and hypothesizes that the goal of this processing is to recode in order to reduce a generalized redundancy subject to a constraint that specifies the amount of average information preserved. In the limit of no noise, this theory becomes equivalent to Barlow's redundancy reduction hypothesis, but it leads to very different computational strategies when noise is present. A tractable approach for finding the optimal encoding is to solve the problem in successive stages where at each stage the optimization is performed within a restricted class of transfer functions. We explicitly find the solution for the class of encodings to which the parvocellular retinal processing belongs, namely linear and nondivergent transformations. The solution shows agreement with the experimentally observed transfer functions at all levels of signal to noise."

To understand the representation of images by the mammalian visual system, it might therefore be useful to consider the statistics of images from the natural environment (i.e., images with trees, rocks, bushes, etc). In this study, various coding schemes are compared in relation to how they represent the information in such natural images. The coefficients of such codes are represented by arrays of mechanisms that respond to local regions of space, spatial frequency, and orientation (Gabor-like transforms). For many classes of image, such codes will not be an efficient means of representing information. However, the results obtained with six natural images suggest that the orientation and the spatial-frequency tuning of mammalian simple cells are well suited for coding the information in such images if the goal of the code is to convert higher-order redundancy (e.g., correlation between the intensities of neighboring pixels) into first-order redundancy (i.e., the response distribution of the coefficients). Such coding produces a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio and permits information to be transmitted with only a subset of the total number of cells. These results support Barlow's theory that the goal of natural vision is to represent the information in the natural environment with minimal redundancy."

It is shown that efficient information transmission is achieved by a transformation of the initial three colour mechanisms into an achromatic and two opponent chromatic channels. The derivation of the transformation is dependent solely on criteria from information theory. Thus it provides a logical rationale reconciling opponent type processing as an optimal necessary step after the initial three colour mechanisms, unifying respectively the Hering and Young-Helmholtz approaches to colour vision. The effects of chromatic adaptation on the spectral response of the achromatic and two chromatic channels are discussed from the point of view of information theory. It is argued that adaptation serves as a dynamic readjustment of these responses, necessary to meet criteria of efficient colour information transmission. The results are confronted with empirical observations to test the principles of the theory and the relation to other theories is discussed. Within the same framework the issue of trichromacy is discussed. It is argued that a broad class of typical colour spectra can effectively be represented by three significant degrees of freedom that make up a trichromatic system."

The method exploits the fact that for any cell that combines linearly the signals from cones there is a restricted set of lights to which it is equally sensitive, and whose members can be exchanged for one another without evoking a response. Stimuli are represented in a three\u2010dimensional space defined by an axis along which only luminance varies, without change in chromaticity, a 'constant B' axis along which chromaticity varies without changing the excitation of blue\u2010sensitive (B) cones, a 'constant R & G' axis along which chromaticity varies without change in the excitation of red\u2010sensitive (R) or green\u2010sensitive (G) cones. The orthogonal axes intersect at a white point. The isoluminant plane defined by the intersection of the 'constant B' and 'constant R & G' axes contains lights that vary only in chromaticity. In polar coordinates the constant B axis is assigned the azimuth 0\u2010180 deg, and the constant R & G axis the azimuth 90\u2010270 deg. Luminance is expressed as elevation above or below the isoluminant plane (\u201090 to +90 deg). For any cell that combines cone signals linearly, there is one plane in this space, passing through the white point, that contains all lights that can be exchanged silently. The position of this 'null plane' provides the 'signature' of the cell, and is specified by its azimuth (the direction in which it intersects the isoluminant plane of the stimulus space) and its elevation (its angle of inclination to the isoluminant plane). A colour television receiver was used to produce sinusoidal gratings whose chromaticity and luminance could be modulated along any vector passing through the white point in the space described. The spatial and temporal frequencies of modulation could be varied over a large range. When stimulated by patterns of low spatial and low temporal frequency, two groups of cells in the parvocellular laminae of the l.g.n. were distinguished by the locations of their null planes. The null planes of the larger group were narrowly distributed about an azimuth of 92.6 deg and more broadly about an elevation of 51.5 deg, which suggests that they receive opposed, but not equally balanced, inputs from only R and G cones. These we call R\u2010G cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

In providing techniques for quantifying situations which have hitherto been difficult or impossible to quantify, they suggest new and more precise ways of conceptualizing these situations (see Miller [12] for a general discussion and bibliography). Events ordered in time are particularly amenable to informational analysis; thus language sequences are being extensively studied, and other sequences, such as those of music, plainly invite research. In this paper I shall indicate some of the ways in which the concepts and techniques of information theory may clarify our understanding of visual perception. When we begin to consider perception as an information-handling process, it quickly becomes clear that much of the information received by any higher organism is redundant. Sensory events are highly interdependent in both space and time: if we know at a given moment the states of a limited number of receptors (i.e., whether they are firing or not firing), we can make better-than-chance inferences with respect to the prior and subsequent states of these receptors, and also with respect to the present, prior, and subsequent states of other receptors. The preceding statement, taken in its broadest im1 The experimental work for this study was performed as part of the United States Air Force Human Resources Research and Development Program.

In the present discussion, however, we shall restrict our attention to special types of lawfulness which may exist in space at a fixed time, and which seem particularly relevant to processes of visual perception."

A quantitative criterion is adopted to choose the intensity match of the two colours in the stimulus: this is the intensity ratio at which contrast sensitivity for the chromatic grating differs most from the contrast sensitivity for a monochromatic luminance grating. Results show that this intensity match varies with spatial frequency and does not necessarily correspond to a luminance match between the colours. Contrast sensitivities to the chromatic gratings at the criterion intensity match are measured as a function of spatial frequency, using field sizes ranging from 2 to 23 deg. Both blue\u2010yellow and red\u2010green contrast sensitivity functions have similar low\u2010pass characteristics, with no low\u2010frequency attenuation even at low frequencies below 0.1 cycles/deg. These functions indicate that the limiting acuities based on red\u2010green and blue\u2010yellow colour discriminations are similar at 11 or 12 cycles/deg. Comparisons between contrast sensitivity functions for the chromatic and monochromatic gratings are made at the same mean luminances. Results show that, at low spatial frequencies below 0.5 cycles/deg, contrast sensitivity is greater to the chromatic gratings, consisting of two monochromatic gratings added in antiphase, than to either monochromatic grating alone. Above 0.5 cycles/deg, contrast sensitivity is greater to monochromatic than to chromatic gratings."

This lends support to Barlow's argument for factorial sensory processing, by demonstrating how it can solve actual pattern recognition problems. Two techniques for supervised factorial learning are explored, one of which gives a novel distributed solution requiring only positive examples. Also, a new nonlinear technique for factorial learning is introduced that uses neural networks based on almost reversible cellular automata. Due to the special functional connectivity of these networkswhich resemble some biological microcircuitslearning requires only simple local algorithms. Also, supervised factorial learning is shown to be a viable alternative to backpropagation. One significant advantage is the existence of a measure for the performance of intermediate learning stages."
