How do processes of object and scene categorisation use the information associated with different perceptual spatial scales? One scenario suggests that recognition should use coarse blobs before fine-scale edges because scale usage is perceptually determined. However, perceptual determination neglects one important aspect of any recognition task: the information demands of the considered classification of the input. Evidence is reviewed suggesting that scale usage could be flexibly determined by the diagnosticity of scale-specific cues for different categorisations of scenes and faces."

A series of high-pass and low-pass spatially filtered versions of a visual scene were generated. Observers' ratings of these filtered versions of the scene for perceived image quality indicated that quality was determined both by the bandwidth of spatial information and the presence of high-spatial-frequency edge information. When sequences of three different versions of the scene were presented over an interval of 120 ms the perceived quality of the resulting composite image was determined both from the ratings of the individual components of that sequence and from the order in which these components were presented. When the order of spatial information in a sequence moved from coarse to fine detail the perceived quality of the composite image was significantly better than when the order moved from fine to coarse. This evidence of a coarse-to-fine bias in pattern integration was further investigated with a detection paradigm. The pattern of errors once again indicated that temporal integration of spatial information was superior when a coarse-to-fine mode of information delivery was employed. Taken together the data indicate that the pattern-integration mechanism has an inherent order bias and does not accumulate spatial information so efficiently when the \u2018natural\u2019 coarse-to-fine order is violated."

                "text": "A great deal of evidence suggests that early in processing, retinal images are filtered by parallel, spatial frequency selective channels. We attempt to incorporate this view of early vision with the principle of global precedence, which holds that Gestalt-like processes sensitive to global image configurations tend to dominate local feature processing in human pattern perception. Global precedence is inferred from the pattern of reaction times observed when visual patterns contain multiple cues at different levels of spatial scale. Specifically, it is frequently observed that global processing times are largely unaffected by conflicting local cues, but local processing times are substantially lengthened by conflicting global cues. The asymmetry of these effects suggests the dominant role of global configurations. Since global spatial information is effectively represented by low spatial frequencies, global precedence potentially implies a low frequency dominance. The thesis is that low spatial frequencies tend to be available before information carried by higher frequency bands, producing a coarse-to-fine temporal order in visual spatial perception. It is suggested that a variety of factors contribute to the prior entry of low frequency information, including the high contrast gain of the magnocellular pathway, the amplitude spectra typical of natural images, and inhibitory interactions between the parallel frequency-tuned channels. Evidence suggesting a close relationship between global precedence and spatial frequency channels is provided by observations that the essential features of the global precedence effect are obtained using patterns consisting of low and high frequency sinusoids. The hypothesis that these asymmetric interference effects are due to interactions between parallel spatial channels is supported by an analysis of reaction times (RTs), which shows that RTs to redundant low and high frequency cues produce less facilitation than predictions that assume the channels are independent. In view of previous work showing that global precedence depends upon the low frequency content of the stimuli, we suggest that low spatial frequencies represent the sine qua non for the dominance of configurational cues in human pattern perception, and that this configurational dominance reflects the microgenesis of visual pattern perception. This general view of the temporal dynamics of visual pattern recognition is discussed, is considered from an evolutionary perspective, and is related to certain statistical regularities in natural scenes. Potential adaptive advantages of an interactive parallel architecture that confers an initial processing advantage to low resolution information are explored."

Six experiments explore the effect of a previous level of processing on current processing. The contention that processing at a given level of detail biases the distribution of attention so that more is allocated to that level for future processing is supported by the presence in the data of a robust level-readiness effect, whereby processing is faster at a given level if previous processing has been at that level. The level-readiness effect occurs regardless of the conspicuity of features at the various levels. Conflict between levels seems to depend on the imbalance of conspicuity and attention allocation between levels, with the more conspicuous or attended-to-level interfering more. A model of two-state attention switching similar to that of Sperling and Melchnor (1978) is proposed to explain these data. the final experiment confirmed the somewhat unusual prediction of this model that sometimes processing under focusing-attention conditions can be slower than that under divided-attention conditions."

To investigate this, we studied adaptation to lines of specific orientation, a process that occurs in primary visual cortex3. When a single grating is presented in the periphery of the visual field, human observers are aware of its orientation, but when it is flanked by other similar gratings ('crowding'), its orientation becomes impossible to discern4,5. Nevertheless, we show that orientation-specific adaptation is not affected by crowding, implying that spatial resolution is limited by an attentional filter acting beyond the primary visual cortex. Consistent with this, we find that attentional resolution is greater in the lower than in the upper visual field, whereas there is no correspond-ing asymmetry in the primary visual cortex. We suggest that the attentional filter acts in one or more higher visual cortical areas to restrict the availability of visual information to conscious awareness6."

In the visual system, adapting to a pattern increases the threshold of the ability to see that pattern, and reduces the perceived contrast of the pattern above threshold2\u20134. Most neurons of the striate cortex reduce their responsiveness after being stimulated for some time by a high-contrast pattern5\u20137. Such an effect may lie behind these psychophysical adaptation phenomena2\u20134. These adaptation effects have been reported to be confined to patterns of similar orientation, which is understandable in that the visual neurons that adapt are only excited by a small range of orientations8. Neurophysiological evidence suggests that neurons with different orientation preferences have inhibitory interconnections9\u201313. It is therefore of interest to explore the possible effects of these connections on perception. Here we show that adapting to a horizontal pattern can reduce the perceived contrast of a vertical test pattern more than a horizontal test pattern. These 'cross-orientation' effects are modelled by a division-like process, whereas the more normal 'similar-orientation' effects are modelled by a subtractive process."

We used the global, or center-of-gravity, effect whereby a saccadic eye movement directed to a target consisting of a pair of elements has an amplitude intermediate between that of saccades directed to the individual elements. We measured the effect using target elements with different visual characteristics, including phase-reversal checkerboard targets that had the same space-average luminance as the background. The contribution to the center-of-gravity calculation was used to measure relative salience. We found that positive and negative contrast elements contribute almost equal weightings. Thus, salience, assessed in this way, is a highly nonlinear function of luminance. The salience of checkerboard targets was found to decrease as check size was decreased and increase as the overall size of the target was increased. Checkerboards with an empty center were as effective as were full checkerboards, showing the importance of boundaries in the salience signal."

In all experiments, two objects were distinguished by being enclosed in either a square or a circle, and each object consisted of a larger letter constructed from smaller letters. Attention was directed to one of the two objects on the basis of either the square/circle distinction (Experiments 1, 2, and 3) or a visual precue (Experiment 4). In agreement with previous findings, for attended objects, the global aspect was identified faster and was more difficult to ignore than the local aspect. However, for nonattended objects, no evidence was found for an overall priority in perceptual processing leading to identification of the global aspect. Rather, the results indicate that there is a priority in perceptual processing for the general category of the global information contained within nonattended objects. Although the results provide some support for the view that global information receives priority during early perceptual analysis, aspects of the results are more consistent with postidentification accounts of global precedence."

                "text": "Abstract When the stored representation of the meaning of a stimulus is accessed through the processing of a sensory input it is maintained in an activated state for a certain amount of time that allows for further processing. This semantic activation is generally accompanied by conscious identification, which can be demonstrated by the ability of a person to perform discriminations on the basis of the meaning of the stimulus. The idea that a sensory input can give rise to semantic activation without concomitant conscious identification was the central thesis of the controversial research in subliminal perception. Recently, new claims for the existence of such phenomena have arisen from studies in dichotic listening, parafoveal vision, and visual pattern masking. Because of the fundamental role played by these types of experiments in cognitive psychology, the new assertions have raised widespread interest. The purpose of this paper is to show that this enthusiasm may be premature. Analysis of the three new lines of evidence for semantic activation without conscious identification leads to the following conclusions. (1) Dichotic listening cannot provide the conditions needed to demonstrate the phenomenon. These conditions are better fulfilled in parafoveal vision and are realized ideally in pattern masking. (2) Evidence for the phenomenon is very scanty for parafoveal vision, but several tentative demonstrations have been reported for pattern masking. It can be shown, however, that none of these studies has included the requisite controls to ensure that semantic activation was not accompanied by conscious identification of the stimulus at the time of presentation. (3) On the basis of current evidence it is most likely that these stimuli were indeed consciously identified."

How do we accomplish this visual-cognitive feat? The commonly held explanation is known as the schema hypothesis, according to which a visual scene is rapidly identified as a member of a semantic category, and predictions generated from the scene category are then used to aid subsequent object identification. In this paper I will first outline and offer a critique of the evidence that has been taken to support the schema hypothesis. I will then offer an alternative framework for understanding scene processing, which I will call the local-processing hypothesis. This hypothesis assumes a modular, informationally-encapsulated architecture, and explicitly includes the role of covert visual attention in scene processing."

Ward, 1982), and studies in neuropsychology have shown an absence of this priming effect in patient groups with parietal damage (R. Rafal & L. C. Robertson, 1994). The present experiments demonstrate that level-specific priming is linked to the spatial frequency differences between global and local forms in hierarchical patterns. They also show that level-specific priming is present even when the stimulus as a whole changes location. The effects last for up to 3 s without diminution and are not affected by changes in color, polarity, or contrast.

                "text": "Detection of a visual signal requires information to reach a system capable of eliciting arbitrary responses required by the experimenter. Detection latencies are reduced when subjects receive a cue that indicates where in the visual field the signal will occur. This shift in efficiency appears to be due to an alignment (orienting) of the central attentional system with the pathways to be activated by the visual input. It would also be possible to describe these results as being due to a reduced criterion at the expected target position. However, this description ignores important constraints about the way in which expectancy improves performance. First, when subjects are cued on each trial, they show stronger expectancy effects than when a probable position is held constant for a block, indicating the active nature of the expectancy. Second, while information on spatial position improves performance, information on the form of the stimulus does not. Third, expectancy may lead to improvements in latency without a reduction in accuracy. Fourth, there appears to be little ability to lower the criterion at two positions that are not spatially contiguous. A framework involving the employment of a limited-capacity attentional mechanism seems to capture these constraints better than the more general language of criterion setting. Using this framework, we find that attention shifts are not closely related to the saccadic eye movement system. For luminance detection the retina appears to be equipotential with respect to attention shifts, since costs to unexpected stimuli are similar whether foveal or peripheral. These results appear to provide an important model system for the study of the relationship between attention and the structure of the visual system."

Subjects were required to determine which of two target letters was present in eight-letter circular displays. In precue conditions, a primary and a secondary target location were designated 150 ms before target onset by an indicator that varied in validity. In the control conditions no cue was provided. A second experiment verified several assumptions that had been made in interpreting the data of Experiment 1. Modifications in Jonides' (1983) two-process model were suggested in terms of a zoom lens model of attentional resources. Instead of two alternative processing modes, attentional resources are conceived as capable of distribution over the visual field, but with low resolving power, or as continuously constricting to small portions of the visual field with a concomitant increase in processing power."

Do people with low visual acuity benefit more from color? Three experiments measured reaction time (RT) and accuracy for naming food objects displayed in 4 types of images: gray scale or color, and high or low spatial resolution (produced by blur). Normally sighted Ss had faster RTs with color, but the improvement was not significantly greater for images with low spatial resolution. Low vision subjects were also faster with color, but the difference did not depend significantly on acuity. In 2 additional experiments, it was found that the faster RTs for color stimuli were related to objects' prototypicality but not to their color diagnosticity. It was concluded that color does improve object recognition, and the mechanism is probably sensory rather than cognitive in origin."

This effect is referred to as global precedence. The present experiments tested the hypothesis that global precedence depends on the presence of low spatial frequencies using stimuli constructed from contrast balanced dots. Stimuli composed of contrast balanced dots are largely devoid of low-frequency content. Choice reaction time to identify either the local or global pattern information was the dependent measure. Global precedence was found only for control stimuli that contained low spatial frequencies. In the absence of low-frequency information, local precedence was obtained. These findings suggest that global precedence is heavily dependent on the low spatial frequency content of the patterns."

This property of the visual system has been overlooked in previous tachistoecopic studies, the consequences of which are examined. Three groups of 12 right-handed males were presented with faces to categorize as \u201cfemale\u201d or \u201cmale,\u201d each group at differentexposure duration, 40, 120, or 200 msec. A shift in visual field superiority was observed, from the left to the right field, as stimulus energy increased IExperiment 1). This result was replicated in Experiment 2, using a within-subject design. In Experiment 3, display energy was kept constant by reciprocally varying the duration of exposure and the level of luminance. The same shift in visual field superiority as in the previous experiments obtained when exposure duration increased. Implications of these results for future tachistoscopic studies and for a model of cerebral laterallzation are discussed. It is suggested that the right and left hemispheres may not require an equal amount of energy to efficiently engage into cognitive processing."

                "text": "It has recently become apparent that if face images are degraded by spatial quantisation, or block averaging, there is a nonlinear acceleration of the decline in accuracy of recognition as block size increases. This suggests recognition requires a critical minimum range of object spatial frequencies. Two experiments were performed to clarify the phenomenon. In experiment 1, the speed and accuracy of recognition for six frontoparallel photographs of faces were measured. After familiarisation training sessions, the images were shown for 100 ms with 11, 21, and 42 pixels per face, horizontally measured. Transformations calculated to remove the same range of spatial frequencies were performed by means of quantisation, a Fourier low-pass filter, and Gaussian blurring. Although accuracy declined and speed increased in a significant, nonlinear manner in all cases as the image quality was reduced, it did so at a faster rate for the quantised images. In experiment 2, faces rated as being typical were shown at 9, 12, 23, and 45 pixels per face and with appropriate Fourier low-pass versions. The nonlinear decline was confirmed and it was shown that it could not be attributed to a ceiling effect. A further condition allowed quantised and Fourier low-pass conditions to be compared with an unstructured-noise condition of equal strength to that of the quantised images. These gave comparable, but slightly less impaired, recognition than the quantised images. It can be inferred from these results that the removal of a critical range of at least 8\u201316 cycles per face of information explains the step decline in recognition seen with quantised images. However, the decline found with quantised images is reinforced by internal masking from pixelisation."

Two experiments focused upon the following questions: (1) Can the spatial extent of the attentional focus be made to vary in response to precues? (2) As the area of the attentional focus increases, is there a decrease in processing efficiency for stimuli within the focus? (3) Is the boundary of the focus sharply demarked from the residual field, or does it show a gradual dropoff in processing resources? Subjects were required to search eight-letter circular displays for one of two target letters and reaction times were recorded. One to four adjacent display positions were precued by underlines at various stimulus onset asynchronies before display presentation. A response competition paradigm was used, in which the \u201cother target\u201d was used as a noise letter in noncued as well as cued locations. The results were in good agreement with the zoom lens model."

                "text": "Table I Example of Results Assumed to Support Perception Without Awareness condition, on the other hand, provides the critical observations. A masking stimulus that functions as a central mask (cf. Turvey, 1973) is used to provide sufficient degradation of the priming stimulus so that either presence-absence decisions are no better than chance (Fowler et al., 1981; Marcel, 1980, Note 1, Note 2) or identification of the primes is not possible (McCauley et al., 1980). The surprising result found in these studies is that semantic-priming effects are virtually unaffected by the masking stimulus. Thus, even though the masking stimulus eliminatesrliscriminated verbal reports, the priming stimuli continue to facilitate both lexical decisions (e.g., Fowler et al., 1981; Marcel, 1980) and naming latencies (McCauley et al., 1980) to target stimuli. Table 1 presents the general pattern of results used to support the conclusion that masked stimuli for which there is no awareness may nevertheless produce differential responses. Verbal report accuracy is measured relative to chance performance, and the magnitude of semantic priming reflects the difference between the RT to targets preceded by related primes and the RT to targets preceded by unrelated, control primes. The critical aspect of the table is that while masking decreases verbal report accuracy from 100070 to 0%, it has virtually no effect upon the magnitude of semantic priming. It is this complete dissociation between report accuracy and priming across mask conditions that provides such compelling support for the conclusion that perception may occur in the absence of awareness. Any decrease in the magnitude of priming under the mask condition would provide a skeptic with a basis for arguing that the results only show that the awareness threshold may not have been accurately determined. However, since most skeptics would expect at least some decrease in the magnitude of priming under the mask condition, it is this absence of any significant effect of a mask upon priming that provides the critical evidence. The above arguments, coupled with the reported observations, are very seductive. However, the validity of the arguments depends entirely upon the adequacy of the procedures used to determine the thresholds"

The hypothesis of an analogue movement of the attentional \u201cspotlight\u201d across the visual field was also tested. Choice reaction time to stimuli was determined in a response competition paradigm. Subjects viewed a central fixation point and the stimuli (the letters A and U) were presented at retinal eccentricities of 1\u00b0, 2\u00b0, and 3\u00b0 along the horizontal meridian to the left and right of fixation. Two letters were simultaneously presented in all experimental conditions. For compatible noise, the second letter was identical to the target, and for incompatible noise, the second letter was the other letter of the target set. The target letter in a trial was designated by an underline that either occurred simultaneously with the onset of the two-letter display or preceded the display by 25, 50, 75, 100, or 175 msec. The target letter occurred equally often in each of the six display positions and the noise letter equally often in each of the remaining positions. The response competition effect of an incompatible noise letter was found to be a joint function of target and noise-letter location, an effect that changed over time from onset of the underline precue to the onset of the display. With simultaneous onset, interference was largely independent of target and noise location, but with increasing asynchrony of onset, noise interference became increasingly confined to locations adjacent to the target. No evidence was found for an analogue movement of an attentional \u201cspotlight\u201d across the visual field."

Evidence for acquired distinctiveness (increased perceptual sensitivity for items that are categorized differently) was obtained. One case of acquired equivalence (decreased perceptual sensitivity for items that are categorized together) was found for separable, but not integral, dimensions. Acquired equivalence within a categorization-relevant dimension was never found for either integral or separable dimensions.

We examined this question by having subjects identify local or global forms of hierarchical stimuli that had beencontrast balanced. Contrast balancing eliminates low spatial frequencies, so that both local and global forms must be identified on the basis of high spatial frequency information. Response times (RTs) to global (but not local) forms were slowed for contrast-balanced stimuli, suggesting that low spatial frequencies mediate the global RT advantage typically found. In contrast, interference between local and global forms was little affected by contrast balancing or by shifts of attention between local and global forms, suggesting that it does not result from inhibitory interactions between spatial frequency channels or from temporal precedence of low versus high spatial frequency information. Finally, shifts of attention between local and global forms were also little affected by contrast balancing, suggesting that they were not based on spatial frequency."

In Experiment 1, the various images were compared with each other, using a paired comparison method. All images were presented for 40 msec, and observers were asked to judge which of each pair of images had the longest duration. The results showed that images containing a wide spatial frequency bandwidth were judged to be of longer duration than were images of a narrower bandwidth, regardless of whether the latter were high- or lowpass filtered. In Experiment 2, a 40-msec presentation of each of the images was compared with a presentation of a probe that was 20,40, 60, or 80 msec in duration. Observers again judged which of each pair of images had the longest duration. The results were very similar to those of Experiment 1, with wide bandwidth images being judged to be of longer duration than were narrow bandwidth images. In Experiment 3, instead of comparing the various filtered versions of the image with each other, we attempted to obtain a direct measure of perceived duration by comparing a flashing LED to a 40-msec flash of a subset of the images used in the previous experiments. The observers\u2019 task was to adjust the duration of the LED flash to match the perceived duration of each image. The results confirmed the results of the previous experiments, again indicating that wide bandwidth images are perceived to have longer phenomenal durations than narrow bandwidth images are perceived to have. These results could be predicted from previous research in the literature on the effects of spatial frequency on perceptual lag but not from research on visual persistence. It is argued that the effects described here can probably be explained best by postulating a link between perceived duration and the integration of separately processed spatial frequency information."

Two studies are reported which suggest that, while certain aspects of attention require that locations be scanned serially, at least one operation may be carried out in parallel across several independent loci in the visual field. That is the operation of indexing features and tracking their identity. The studies show that: (a) subjects are able to track a subset of up to 5 objects in a field of 10 identical randomly-moving objects in order to distinguish a change in a target from a change in a distractor; and (b) when the speed and distance parameters of the display are designed so that, on the basis of some very conservative assumptions about the speed of attention movement and encoding times, the predicted performance of a serial scanning and updating algorithm would not exceed about 40% accuracy, subjects still manage to do the task with 87% accuracy. These findings are discussed in relation to an earlier, and independently motivated model of feature-binding--called the FINST model--which posits a primitive identity maintenance mechanism that indexes and tracks a limited number of visual objects in parallel. These indexes are hypothesized to serve the function of binding visual features prior to subsequent pattern recognition."

This seems to be a reasonable principle, and it compels us to attempt to specify and understand the nature of the preliminary operations that underlie a given process. Such a principle is quite relevant to the problem of face perception, and it is with early visual processes, as well as their implications for later operations, that the present chapter will be concerned. It would be misleading, however, to begin with the idea that one can account for most of the processes underlying perception by considering only these early processes, and this is especially true of face perception. For one thing, perception is a process resulting from the interaction of the incoming information and mental states or cerebral structures, and it is therefore necessary to understand the nature and characteristics of this interaction to explain perceptual processes. For another, the human face is an extremely familiar multidimensional pattern, and our frequent exposure to such a stimulus has enabled us to develop certain processing mechanisms, which some authors (e.g, Goldstein & Chance, 1981) have referred to as \u201cschemata,\u201d that allow access to consistent dimensions which facilitate perception and memory."

Of interest is whether the identification of the target object depends on the identification of the scene or the identification of other diagnostic objects in the scene. Experiment 1 indicated objects are more difficult to identify when located in an \"episodically\" inconsistent background even when the same diagnostic objects are present in both inconsistent and consistent backgrounds. Experiment 2 demonstrated that the degree to which noncued (cohort) objects are consistent with the target object has no effect on the object identification task. Experiment 3 showed consistent episodic background information facilitated object identification and inconsistent episodic background information did not interfere relative to \"nonsense\" backgrounds roughly equated on visual characteristics. Implications for models of scene perception are discussed."

After selective removal of low spatial frequencies two major changes occurred in the pattern of results. First, response times to global stimuli were significantly slower and the usual speed advantage of global over local processing was lost. Second, when processing local features the usual decrease in response speed when the local and global letters are not the same (consistency effect) was not obtained. These effects could not be explained by changes in error rate, by contrast variation resulting from the process of filtering, or by loss of visual sensitivity due to greater eccentricity of global images."

This question was examined by having subjects identify local or global forms of stimuli that had been \u201ccontrast balanced,\u201d a technique that eliminates low spatial frequencies. Response times (RTs) to global (but not local) forms were slowed for contrast-balanced stimuli, suggesting that low spatial frequencies mediate the global RT advantage typically reported. In contrast, the beneficial effect of having targets appear at the same, as opposed to a different, level as that on the immediately preceding trial was unaffected by contrast balancing. This suggests that attentional selection between different levels of structure is not based on spatial frequency.

A possible mechanism, suggested by studies of motion displacement in spatially random patterns, is that low-level motion detectors have a limited spatial range, which ensures that they tend to be stimulated over time by the same object1\u20133. This model predicts that the direction of displacement of random patterns cannot be detected reliably above a critical absolute displacement value (Dmax) that is independent of the size or density of elements in the display1,4,5. It has been inferred that Anax is a measure of the size of motion detectors in the visual pathway1,3. Other studies, however, have shown that Dmax increases with element size6\u20138, in which case the most likely interpretation is thatDmax depends on the probability of false matches between pattern elements following a displacement. These conflicting accounts are reconciled here by showing that Umax is indeed determined by the spacing between the elements in the pattern, but only after fine detail has been removed by a physiological prefiltering stage: the filter required to explain the data has a similar size to the receptive field of neurons in the primate mag-nocellular pathway. The model explains why Dmax can be increased by removing high spatial frequencies from random patterns, and simplifies our view of early motion detection."

The theoretical lower limit for the joint entropy, or uncertainty, of these variables is achieved by an optimal 2D filter family whose spatial weighting functions are generated by exponentiated bivariate second-order polynomials with complex coefficients, the elliptic generalization of the one-dimensional elementary functions proposed in Gabor's famous theory of communication [J. Inst. Electr. Eng. 93, 429 (1946)]. The set includes filters with various orientation bandwidths, spatial-frequency bandwidths, and spatial dimensions, favoring the extraction of various kinds of information from an image. Each such filter occupies an irreducible quantal volume (corresponding to an independent datum) in a four-dimensional information hyperspace whose axes are interpretable as 2D visual space, orientation, and spatial frequency, and thus such a filter set could subserve an optimally efficient sampling of these variables. Evidence is presented that the 2D receptive-field profiles of simple cells in mammalian visual cortex are well described by members of this optimal 2D filter family, and thus such visual neurons could be said to optimize the general uncertainty relations for joint 2D-spatial-2D-spectral information resolution. The variety of their receptive-field dimensions and orientation and spatial-frequency bandwidths, and the correlations among these, reveal several underlying constraints, particularly in width/length aspect ratio and principal axis organization, suggesting a polar division of labor in occupying the quantal volumes of information hyperspace.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Previous work by Tipper (1985) demonstrated that the priming effect of an ignored picture on a subsequent categorically related picture is inhibitory. This effect was termednegative priming. Tipper concluded that ignored pictures achieved abstract categorical levels of internal representation, and that these representations were inhibited during selection of a simultaneously presented picture. This conclusion, however, was premature. Observation of the figures used by Tipper suggests that objects within a category have greater structural similarity than do objects in different categories. The negative priming effect could therefore be at a structural level of representation. The present study examined priming across symbolic domains (pictures and words) where there was no structural relationship between objects. Negative priming was again observed and was equivalent to the negative priming observed within symbolic domain. These data suggest that ignored drawings and words do achieve abstract categorical levels of representation, and that the mechanisms underlying negative priming operate at, or beyond, this level."

In two experiments, sequences of 16 color photographs were presented at rates of 113, 167, or 333 msec per picture. In one group, subjects were given an immediate test of recognition memory for the pictures and in other groups they searched for a target picture. Even when the target had only been specified by a title (e.g., a boat) detection of a target was strikingly superior to recognition memory. Detection was slightly but significantly better for pictured than named targets. In a third experiment pictures were presented for 50, 70, 90 or 120 msec preceded and followed by a visual mask; at 120 msec recognition memory was as accurate as detection had been. The results, taken together with those in 1969 of Potter and Levy for slower rates of sequential presentation, suggest that on the average a scene is understood and so becomes immune to ordinary visual masking within about 100 msec but requires about 300 msec of further processing before the memory representation is resistant to conceptual masking from a following picture. Possible functions of a short-term conceptual memory, such as the control of eye fixations, are discussed."

Contrast balancing eliminates low spatial frequencies, so that both local and global forms must be identified based on high-spatial-frequency information. In all three experiments, response times (RTs) to global forms were slowed for contrast-balanced stimuli, suggesting that low spatial frequencies facilitate the analysis of global forms. In contrast, interference between local and global forms was little affected by contrast balancing, suggesting that interference does not depend on differences in spatial frequency between local and global forms. Consistent with earlier data, some evidence of a difference in interference for stimuli presented in the right versus left visual field was found. However, this difference was not affected by contrast balancing\u2014a finding that is at odds with the hypothesis that the hemifield asymmetry in interference reflects a hemispheric difference in inh..."

Other models of RF shape would predict a greater independence between orientation and spatial-frequency tuning. We have examined this by recording the responses of cat striate-cortex cells to a wide range of different spatial-frequency and orientation combinations. In almost all cells studied, peak orientation did not consistently vary with spatial frequency, but the majority of cells showed some change in peak spatial-frequency tuning with orientation. The amount of change in peak spatial frequency tended to be greater for cells that were narrowly tuned for orientation. However, cells narrowly (and also very broadly) tuned for spatial frequency tended to show considerable independence of spatial-frequency and orientation tuning, and in all but a few cells the degree of change was less than predicted by the classic RF model. Such cells were found to fire only to patterns whose local spatial spectra fell within a compact, restricted, roughly circular two-dimensional spatial-frequency region. We conclude that the two-dimensional RF shape of striate cells more closely approximates that predicted by a two-dimensional Gabor model or by a Gaussian-derivative model than it does the classic shape based on the output of geniculate cells with aligned RF's."

(1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

Subjects were shown figures consisting of a large C composed of smaller Cs and asked to identify the orientation of either the global C or its local elements. Prior to performing the task subjects were adapted to different spatial frequencies and the effect on subsequent performance was assessed. Two main results were found. First, the adapting frequency that most affected the global task was often lower than that most affecting the local task, suggesting that high and low frequencies independently code the structure of an image. Second, reaction time to global figures was often faster than to local figures at all levels of detectability, again suggesting a role of low-frequency channels in global processing."

Local cortical processors may coordinate their activity by maximizing the transmission of information coherently related to the context in which it occurs, thus forming synchronized population codes. This coordination involves contextual field (CF) connections that link processors within and between cortical regions. The effects of CF connections are distinguished from those mediating receptive field (RF) input; it is shown how CFs can guide both learning and processing without becoming confused with the transmission of RF information. Simulations explore the capabilities of networks built from local processors with both RF and CF connections. Physiological evidence for synchronization, CFs, and plasticity of the RF and CF connections is described. Coordination via CFs is related to perceptual grouping, the effects of context on contrast sensitivity, amblyopia, implicit influences of color in achromotopsia, object and word perception, and the discovery of distal environmental variables and their interactions through self-organization. Cortical computation could thus involve the flexible evaluation of relations between input signals by locally specialized but adaptive processors whose activity is dynamically associated and coordinated within and between regions through specialized contextual connections."

Latencies in naming word and picture targets were analyzed as a function of several characteristics of a preceding prime, including whether it was a word or a picture, its duration of exposure, the interval between the prime and target onset, and whether or not the prime was consciously identified and reported by the subject. Results indicated that a common semantic code is available that can represent the meaning of either a word or a picture. This semantic representation, however, appears to be more easily activated by picture primes than by word primes and seems to benefit the naming of picture targets more than the naming of word targets. Despite the advantage for pictures with respect to semantic activation, overall processing in the naming task was slower and more attention demanding for pictures than for words. Comparison of our data with data on classification, in which an opposite pattern occurs (overall processing appears to be slower and more attention demanding for words than for pictures), suggests that, on the average, pictures have faster and more automatic access to their meanings than to their names but that words have faster and more automatic access to their names than to their meanings. This conclusion concerning the relative ability of stimuli to activate different kinds of internal representations has implications for a theory of the basis and development of automaticity."

The global-precedence hypothesis, considered by many as a modern version of the Gestaltist claim about the perceptual primacy of wholes, has generated a large body of research, but the debate still remains very active. This article reviews the research within the global/local paradigm, and critically analyzes the assumptions underlying this paradigm. The extent to which this line of research contributes to understanding the role of wholistic processing in object perception is discussed. It is concluded that one should be very cautious in making inferences about wholistic processing from the processing advantage of the global level of stimulus structure. A distinction is proposed between global properties, defined by their position in the hierarchical structure of the stimulus, and wholistic properties, defined as a function of interrelations among component parts. It is suggested that a direct comparison between processing of wholistic and component properties is needed to support the hypothesis about the perceptual primacy of wholistic processing."

Their electrodermal responses to each stimulus were measured and the results showed higher peak amplitude skin conductance responses for familiar than for unfamiliar faces, regardless of whether they had been displayed supraliminally or subliminally. A parallel is drawn between elevated skin conductance responses to subliminal stimuli and findings of covert recognition of familiar faces in prosopagnosic patients, some of whom show increased electrodermal activity (EDA) to previously familiar faces. The supraliminal presentation data also served to replicate similar work by Tranel et al (1985). The results are considered alongside other data indicating the relation between non-conscious, \"automatic\" aspects of normal visual information processing and abilities which can be found to be preserved without awareness after brain injury."

Two issues were investigated: the level of internal representation achieved for the ignored object, and the subsequent fate of this representation. In Experiment 1 a prime display containing two superimposed objects was briefly presented. One second later a probe display was presented containing an object to be named. If the ignored object in the prime display was the same as the subsequent probe, naming latencies were impaired. This effect is termed negative priming. It suggests that internal representations of the ignored object may become associated with inhibition during selection. Thus, selection of a subsequent probe object requiring these inhibited representations is delayed. Experiment 2 replicated the negative priming effect with a shorter inter-stimulus interval. Experiment 3 examined the priming effects of both the ignored and the selected objects. The effect of both identity repetition and a categorical relationship between prime and probe stimuli were investigated. The data showed that for a stimulus selected from the prime display, naming of the same object in the probe display was facilitated. When the same stimulus was ignored in the prime display, however, naming of it in the probe display was again impaired (negative priming). That negative priming was also demonstrated with categorically related objects suggests that ignored objects achieve categorical levels of representation, and that the inhibition may be at this level."

This paper explores one aspect of cognition through the use of a simple model task in which human subjects are asked to commit attention to a position in visual space other than fixation. This instruction is executed by orienting a covert (attentional) mechanism that seems sufficiently time locked to external events that its trajectory can be traced across the visual field in terms of momentary changes in the efficiency of detecting stimuli. A comparison of results obtained with alert monkeys, brain injured and normal human subjects shows the relationship of this covert system to saccadic eye movements and to various brain systems controlling perception and motion. In accordance with Bartlett's insight, the possibility is explored that similar principles apply to orienting of attention toward sensory input and orienting to the semantic structures used in thinking."

The results show that representations of shapes, formed in a single trial and without attention, can last without decrement across 200 intervening trials and with temporal delays of up to a month. No explicit memory of the shapes was available, either immediately or after a delay. There were consistent individual differences in the amount of negative priming shown, and some participants showed only facilitation. There was a trend toward increased facilitation across time, as if the memory of the shape survived longer than an \"action tag\" attached to it, which specified whether it should be attended or ignored.

The orientation of each component was independent and varied randomly between horizontal and vertical. The observers were instructed to signal the orientation of one component (the target) and ignore the other. The dependent measure was the observers\u2019 choice reaction time (CRT) to signal the orientation of the target grating. CRTs to low-frequency targets were similar whether or not the high-frequency component was present, but CRTs to high-frequency targets were slowed by the presence of the low-frequency component. This asymmetric interference was obtained when the contrasts of the individual components were adjusted so as to produce equivalent CRTs when each was presented alone. Reducing the low-frequency contrast below the level needed to match the CRTs generated less interference, and in some cases generated asymmetric interference favoring the high-frequency component. The magnitude of low-frequency interference was also reduced when the stimulus onsets were gradual rather than abrupt. CRTs to compounds in which the component orientations were always the same but varied randomly across trials produced little evidence of a redundancy gain, and the obtained redundancy effect was less than that predicted from a simple model of suprathreshold probability summation between independent frequency and orientation-specific channels. The results are considered in terms of inhibitory interactions between transient and sustained channels."

The similarities between the two phenomena suggest that a common attentional mechanism underlies both, and this has been explicitly proposed by several attention theorists. In this article it is argued that the phenomena of semantic and perceptual priming are qualitatively different, perceptual priming reflecting a sensitivity change in the recognition process brought about by attention, and semantic priming reflecting a bias change in the recognition process brought about by attention. Because different mechanisms are required to produce sensitivity and bias changes, this implies that the attentional mechanisms responsible for semantic and perceptual priming are distinct. In terms of recent discussions of the modularity versus the unity of cognitive architecture, the present conclusion supports a modular architecture for attentional processes."

The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

The representation differs from established techniques in that the code elements are localized in spatial frequency as well as in space. Pixel-to-pixel correlations are first removed by subtracting a lowpass filtered copy of the image from the image itself. The result is a net data compression since the difference, or error, image has low variance and entropy, and the low-pass filtered image may represented at reduced sample density. Further data compression is achieved by quantizing the difference image. These steps are then repeated to compress the low-pass image. Iteration of the process at appropriately expanded scales generates a pyramid data structure. The encoding process is equivalent to sampling the image with Laplacian operators of many scales. Thus, the code tends to enhance salient image features. A further advantage of the present code is that it is well suited for many image analysis tasks as well as for image compression. Fast algorithms are described for coding and decoding."

Target pairs were preceded by a brief (200 ms) related or unrelated (prime) word presented to the nondominant eye. Each participant performed 2 blocks of association judgment task trials: 1 with primes that were legible, and 1 with primes that were masked by a pattern simultaneously presented to the dominant eye. Across 2 experiments, significantly larger masked priming effects were observed for participants who could not detect priming words (low-d' participants) than for participants who could partially see priming words (high-d' participants). This result suggests that undetectable masked primes can activate word meaning and that conscious attempts to process masked primes may inhibit unconscious activation. Additionally, evidence is presented that supports claims that spreading activation is the crucial mechanism responsible for unconscious priming."

The properties of the operator which approximates a signal at a given resolution were studied. It is shown that the difference of information between the approximation of a signal at the resolutions 2/sup j+1/ and 2/sup j/ (where j is an integer) can be extracted by decomposing this signal on a wavelet orthonormal basis of L/sup 2/(R/sup n/), the vector space of measurable, square-integrable n-dimensional functions. In L/sup 2/(R), a wavelet orthonormal basis is a family of functions which is built by dilating and translating a unique function psi (x). This decomposition defines an orthogonal multiresolution representation called a wavelet representation. It is computed with a pyramidal algorithm based on convolutions with quadrature mirror filters. Wavelet representation lies between the spatial and Fourier domains. For images, the wavelet representation differentiates several spatial orientations. The application of this representation to data compression in image coding, texture discrimination and fractal analysis is discussed. >"

An alternative projection algorithm is described that reconstructs a signal from a zero-crossing representation, which is stabilized by keeping the value of the wavelet transform integral between each pair of consecutive zero-crossings. The reconstruction algorithm has a fast convergence and each iteration requires O(N log/sup 2/ (N)) computation for a signal of N samples. The zero-crossings of a wavelet transform define a representation which is particularly well adapted for solving pattern recognition problems. As an example, the implementation and results of a coarse-to-fine stereo-matching algorithm are described. >"

In many situations, however, it is the higher level cognitive process being executed that influences the lower level features that are created. Rather than viewing the repertoire of features as being fixed by low-level processes, we present a theory in which people create features to subserve the representation and categorization of objects. Two types of category learning should be distinguished. Fixed space category learning occurs when new categorizations are representable with the available feature set. Flexible space category learning occurs when new categorizations cannot be represented with the features available. Whether fixed or flexible, learning depends on the featural contrasts and similarities between the new category to be represented and the individual's existing concepts. Fixed feature approaches face one of two problems with tasks that call for new features: If the fixed features are fairly high level and directly useful for categorization, then they will not be flexible enough to represent all objects that might be relevant for a new task. If the fixed features are small, subsymbolic fragments (such as pixels), then regularities at the level of the functional features required to accomplish categorizations will not be captured by these primitives. We present evidence of flexible perceptual changes arising from category learning and theoretical arguments for the importance of this flexibility. We describe conditions that promote feature creation and argue against interpreting them in terms of fixed features. Finally, we discuss the implications of functional features for object categorization, conceptual development, chunking, constructive induction, and formal models of dimensionality reduction."
