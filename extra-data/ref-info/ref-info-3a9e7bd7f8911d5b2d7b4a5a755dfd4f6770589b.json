With the SPARC microprocessor and the VxWorks implementation for that processor used as examples, some of those challenges are described and solutions offered. The most significant recent evolution in real-time computing is the shift from complex-instruction-set-computer (CISC) to RISC architecture. The minimalist RISC architecture runs very fast by running very simply and minimizing interactions outside of the CPU. This allows optimizations such as extensive pipelining and parallel instruction execution, which are difficult to implement in CISC machines. Also, although CISC machines perform many complex functions in hardware, RISC machines off-load these functions to software. Software can optimize these complex functions, thereby avoiding the use of microcoded instructions, which may actually be slower. Although RISC was not developed specifically for real time, RISC chips can perform extremely well in a real-time environment.<<ETX>>"

This paper has two objectives: first, to introduce one such scheme developed by Arthur Dempster and Glen Shafer, to a wider audience; second, to present results that can reduce the compu tationtime complexity from exponential to linear allowing this scheme to be implemented in many more systems. In order to enjoy this reduction, some assumptions about the structure of the type of evidence represented and combined must be made The assumption made here is that each piece of the evidence either confirms or denies a single proposition rather than a disjunction For any domain in which the assumption is justified the savings are available."
