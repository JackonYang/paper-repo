The authors also discuss the complexity issues and provide an overview of the basic theory of state-of-the-art polynomial time interior point methods for linear, conic quadratic, and semidefinite programming. The book's focus on well-structured convex problems in conic form allows for unified theoretical and algorithmical treatment of a wide spectrum of important optimization problems arising in applications."

In the main part of the paper we show that if U is an ellipsoidal uncertainty set, then for some of the most important generic convex optimization problems (linear programming, quadratically constrained programming, semidefinite programming and others) the corresponding robust convex program is either exactly, or approximately, a tractable problem which lends itself to efficientalgorithms such as polynomial time interior point methods."

The algorithm is a single phase interior-point type method; nevertheless, it yields either an approximate optimal solution or detects a possible infeasibility of the problem. In this paper we specialize the algorithm to the solution of general smooth convex optimization problems, which also possess nonlinear inequality constraints and free variables. We discuss an implementation of the algorithm for large-scale sparse convex optimization. Moreover, we present computational results for solving quadratically constrained quadratic programming and geometric programming problems, where some of the problems contain more than 100,000 constraints and variables. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is also practically efficient."

It aims at developing a thorough understanding of the most general theory for interior-point methods, a class of algorithms for convex optimization problems. The study of these algorithms has dominated the continuous optimization literature for nearly 15 years. In that time, the theory has matured tremendously, but much of the literature is difficult to understand, even for specialists. By focusing only on essential elements of the theory and emphasizing the underlying geometry, A Mathematical View of Interior-Point Methods in Convex Optimization makes the theory accessible to a wide audience, allowing them to quickly develop a fundamental understanding of the material."

These problems are too hard to solve in general. Therefore, relaxations such as the Lagrangian relaxation are used. The dual of the Lagrangian relaxation is the SDP relaxation. Thus SDP has enabled us to efficiently solve the Lagrangian relaxation and find good approximate solutions for these hard, possibly nonconvex, Q2P. This area has generated a lot of research recently. This has resulted in many strong and elegant theorems that describe the strength/performance of the bounds obtained from solving relaxations of these Q2P."

The general theory of path-following and potential reduction interior point polynomial time methods, interior point methods, interior point methods for linear and quadratic programming, polynomial time methods for nonlinear convex programming, efficient computation methods for control problems and variational inequalities, and acceleration of path-following methods are covered. In this book, the authors describe the first unified theory of polynomial-time interior-point methods. Their approach provides a simple and elegant framework in which all known polynomial-time interior-point methods can be explained and analyzed; this approach yields polynomial-time interior-point methods for a wide variety of problems beyond the traditional linear and quadratic programs. The book contains new and important results in the general theory of convex programming, e.g., their \"conic\" problem formulation in which duality theory is completely symmetric. For each algorithm described, the authors carefully derive precise bounds on the computational effort required to solve a given family of problems to a given precision. In several cases they obtain better problem complexity estimates than were previously known. Several of the new algorithms described in this book, e.g., the projective method, have been implemented, tested on \"real world\" problems, and found to be extremely efficient in practice.

Modern applications, with their emphasis on numerical methods and more complicated side conditions than equations, have demanded deeper understanding of the concept and how it fits into a larger theoretical picture. A major line of research has been the nonsmooth geometry of one-sided tangent and normal vectors to the set of points satisfying the given constraints. Another has been the game-theoretic role of multiplier vectors as solutions to a dual problem. Interpretations as generalized derivatives of the optimal value with respect to problem parameters have also been explored. Lagrange multipliers are now being seen as arising from a general rule for the subdifferentiation of a nonsmooth objective function which allows black-and-white constraints to be replaced by penalty expressions.

Mathematical models in all these areas give rise to very large systems of linear equations which could not be solved were it not for the fact that the matrices contain relatively few non-zero entries. Only comparatively recently, in the last fifteen years or so, has it become apparent that the equations can be solved even when the pattern is irregular, and it is primarily the solution of such problems that is considered in this book. The subject is intensely practical and this book is written with practicalities ever in mind. Whenever two methods are applicable, their rival merits are considered, and conclusions are based on practical experience where theoretical comparison is not possible. Non-numeric computing techniques have been included, as well as frequent illustrations, in an attempt to bridge the usually wide gap between the printed page and the working computer code. Despite this practical bias, it is recognized that many aspects of the subject are of interest in their own right, and the book aims to be suitable also for a student course, probably at MSc level. Exercises have been included to illustrate and strengthen understanding of the material, as well as to extend it. Efficient use of sparsity is a key to solving large problems in many fields. This book will supply both insight and answers for those attempting to solve these problems."

This important class of nonlinear programming problems has been intensively studied over the past decade and has played a crucial role in an extremely broad range of applications. The focus of the paper will be on posynomial programs and the slightly more general class of signomial programs. The approach used in studying posynomial programs has been generalized to a much broader class of optimization problems, and an excellent survey of that generalized theory recently appeared in a paper by E. L. Peterson [SIAM Rev., 18 (1976), pp. 1\u201351]. We do not consider that generalized theory here. It is our intent to provide the reader with an understanding of the basic results in posynomial and signomial programming that have played a crucial role in applications. After reviewing these basic results, we consider computational methods and applications. Three specific applications are considered in detail, and a bibliography indicating ..."

The objective of these robust formulations is to systematically combat the sensitivity of the optimal portfolio to statistical and modeling errors in the estimates of the relevant market parameters. We introduce \"uncertainty structures\" for the market parameters and show that the robust portfolio selection problems corresponding to these uncertainty structures can be reformulated as second-order cone programs and, therefore, the computational effort required to solve them is comparable to that required for solving convex quadratic programs. Moreover, we show that these uncertainty structures correspond to confidence regions associated with the statistical procedures employed to estimate the market parameters. Finally, we demonstrate a simple recipe for efficiently computing robust portfolios given raw market data and a desired level of confidence."

                "text": "Second-order cone programming (SOCP) problems are convex optimization problems in which a linear function is minimized over the intersection of an affine linear manifold with the Cartesian product of second-order (Lorentz) cones. Linear programs, convex quadratic programs and quadratically constrained convex quadratic programs can all be formulated as SOCP problems, as can many other problems that do not fall into these three categories. These latter problems model applications from a broad range of fields from engineering, control and finance to robust optimization and combinatorial optimization. On the other hand semidefinite programming (SDP)\u2014that is the optimization problem over the intersection of an affine set and the cone of positive semidefinite matrices\u2014includes SOCP as a special case. Therefore, SOCP falls between linear (LP) and quadratic (QP) programming and SDP. Like LP, QP and SDP problems, SOCP problems can be solved in polynomial time by interior point methods. The computational effort per iteration required by these methods to solve SOCP problems is greater than that required to solve LP and QP problems but less than that required to solve SDP\u2019s of similar size and structure. Because the set of feasible solutions for an SOCP problem is not polyhedral as it is for LP and QP problems, it is not readily apparent how to develop a simplex or simplex-like method for SOCP. While SOCP problems can be solved as SDP problems, doing so is not advisable both on numerical grounds and computational complexity concerns. For instance, many of the problems presented in the survey paper of Vandenberghe and Boyd [VB96] as examples of SDPs can in fact be formulated as SOCPs and should be solved as such. In \u00a72, 3 below we give SOCP formulations for four of these examples: the convex quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problem, problems involving fractional quadratic functions \u2217RUTCOR, Rutgers University, e-mail:alizadeh@rutcor.rutgers.edu.

In the simplex method for linear programming this issue is resolved by either the two-phase approach or using the so-called big M technique. In the interior point method, there is a more elegant way to deal with the initialization problem. Viz. the self-dual embedding technique proposed by Ye, Todd and Mizuno [30]. For linear programming this technique makes it possible to identify an optimal solution or conclude the problem to be infeasible/unbounded by solving tts embedded self-dual problem The embedded self-dual problem has a trivial initial solution and has the same stmctare as the original problem. Hence. it eliminates the need to consider the initialization problem at all. In this paper, we extend this approach to solve general conic convex programming, including semidefinite programmng. Since a nonlinear conic convex programming problem may lack the so-called strict complementarity property, it canses diffcairier in identifying solutions for the original problem; based on solutions for the embedded self-dual system. We provide numerous examples from semidefinite programming to illustrate various possibilities which have no analogue in the linear programming case."

                "text": "In the first part of this thesis, we introduce a specific class of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI) whose optimal solution can be characterized exactly. This family corresponds to the case where the associated linear operator maps the cone of positive semidefinite matrices onto itself. In this case, the optimal value equals the spectral radius of the operator. It is shown that some rank minimization problems, as well as generalizations of the structured singular value ($mu$) LMIs, have exactly this property.\n\nIn the same spirit of exploiting structure to achieve computational efficiency, an algorithm for the numerical solution of a special class of frequency-dependent LMIs is presented. These optimization problems arise from robustness analysis questions, via the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma. The procedure is an outer approximation method based on the algorithms used in the computation of hinf norms for linear, time invariant systems. The result is especially useful for systems with large state dimension.\n\nThe other main contribution in this thesis is the formulation of a convex optimization framework for semialgebraic problems, i.e., those that can be expressed by polynomial equalities and inequalities. The key element is the interaction of concepts in real algebraic geometry (Positivstellensatz) and semidefinite programming.\n\nTo this end, an LMI formulation for the sums of squares decomposition for multivariable polynomials is presented. Based on this, it is shown how to construct sufficient Positivstellensatz-based convex tests to prove that certain sets are empty. Among other applications, this leads to a nonlinear extension of many LMI based results in uncertain linear system analysis.\n\nWithin the same framework, we develop stronger criteria for matrix copositivity, and generalizations of the well-known standard semidefinite relaxations for quadratic programming.\n\nSome applications to new and previously studied problems are presented. A few examples are Lyapunov function computation, robust bifurcation analysis, structured singular values, etc. It is shown that the proposed methods allow for improved solutions for very diverse questions in continuous and combinatorial optimization."

We minimize the worst-case residual error using (convex) second-order cone programming, yielding an algorithm with complexity similar to one singular value decomposition of A. The method can be interpreted as a Tikhonov regularization procedure, with the advantage that it provides an exact bound on the robustness of solution and a rigorous way to compute the regularization parameter. When the perturbation has a known (e.g., Toeplitz) structure, the same problem can be solved in polynomial-time using semidefinite programming (SDP). We also consider the case when A,b are rational functions of an unknown-but-bounded perturbation vector. We show how to minimize (via SDP) upper bounds on the optimal worst-case residual. We provide numerical examples, including one from robust identification and one from robust interpolation."

                "text": "Interior methods are an omnipresent, conspicuous feature of the constrained optimization landscape today, but it was not always so. Primarily in the form of barrier methods, interior-point techniques were popular during the 1960s for solving nonlinearly constrained problems. However, their use for linear programming was not even contemplated because of the total dominance of the simplex method. Vague but continuing anxiety about barrier methods eventually led to their abandonment in favor of newly emerging, apparently more efficient alternatives such as augmented Lagrangian and sequential quadratic programming methods. By the early 1980s, barrier methods were almost without exception regarded as a closed chapter in the history of optimization. \nThis picture changed dramatically with Karmarkar's widely publicized announcement in 1984 of a fast polynomial-time interior method for linear programming; in 1985, a formal connection was established between his method and classical barrier methods. Since then, interior methods have advanced so far, so fast, that their influence has transformed both the theory and practice of constrained optimization. This article provides a condensed, selective look at classical material and recent research about interior methods for nonlinearly constrained optimization."

Although interior-point techniques, primarily in the form of barrier methods, were widely used during the 1960s for problems with nonlinear constraints, their use for the fundamental problem of linear programming was unthinkable because of the total dominance of the simplex method. During the 1970s, barrier methods were superseded, nearly to the point of oblivion, by newly emerging and seemingly more efficient alternatives such as augmented Lagrangian and sequential quadratic programming methods. By the early 1980s, barrier methods were almost universally regarded as a closed chapter in the history of optimization. This picture changed dramatically in 1984, when Narendra Karmarkar announced a fast polynomial-time interior method for linear programming; in 1985, a formal connection was established between his method and classical barrier methods. Since then, interior methods have continued to transform both the theory and practice of constrained optimization. We present a condensed, unavoidably incomplete look at classical material and recent research about interior methods."

These advances have recently started to significantly impact various fields of applied sciences and engineering where computational efficiency is essential. This paper focuses on two such fields: digital signal processing and communication. In the past, the widely used optimization methods in both fields had been the gradient descent or least squares methods, both of which are known to suffer from the usual headaches of stepsize selection, algorithm initialization and local minima. With the recent advances in conic and robust optimization, the opportunity is ripe to use the newly developed interior point optimization techniques and highly efficient software tools to help advance the fields of signal processing and digital communication. This paper surveys recent successes of applying interior point and robust optimization to solve some core problems in these two fields. The successful applications considered in this paper include adaptive filtering, robust beamforming, design and analysis of multi-user communication system, channel equalization, decoding and detection. Throughout, our emphasis is on how to exploit the hidden convexity, convex reformulation of semi-infinite constraints, analysis of convergence, complexity and performance, as well as efficient practical implementation."

The main tools employed are a semidefinite programming formulation of the sum of squares decomposition for multivariate polynomials, and some results from real algebraic geometry. The techniques provide a constructive approach for finding bounded degree solutions to the Positivstellensatz, and are illustrated with examples from diverse application fields."

There has not been such a unifying conference in the past fifteen years. The organizer s b lieve that this objective was met during the week of March 4 9. First, of the thirty-nine participants, o ne third represented the current group of emerging researchers in the field; furthermore, five of these thirteen participants were graduate students. Specifically, three (Langi, Naszodi and Papez) from the University of Calg ary, one (Jimenez) from the University of Alberta, and one (Garcia-Colin) from the University Colleg e, London. Next, a common feature of many of the lectures was an exposito ry component. This reflected the acknowledgement and approval of the participants of the unifying as pect of the Workshop. The prevailing intent of the lectures was to present the major problems and recent adv ances of their particular branch of Convexity. Of particular note were the expository lectures on the combina torics of polytopes, the lectures introducing some of the current topics of interests in linear and convex optim ization, and the lectures concerning the various measures associated with convex bodies. Finally, the consensus of the participants was that such a un ifying convexity workshop was not only timely but also overdue. Their enthusiasm for the meeting is well evidenced by the full program of thirty six lectures, and by a very faithful attendance at these lecture s. The smallest number of listeners at any lecture was thirty, and that number was attained only at the last lect ur on Thursday."

Optim., 6 (1996), pp. 342--361] and Kojima, Shindoh, and Hara [SIAM J. Optim., 7 (1997), pp. 86--125.] and recently rediscovered by Monteiro [SIAM J. Optim., 7 (1997), pp. 663--678] in a more explicit form. In analyzing these methods, a number of basic equalities and inequalities were developed in [Kojima, Shindoh, and Hara] and also in [Monteiro] through different means and in different forms. \nIn this paper, we give a concise derivation of the key equalities and inequalities for complexity analysis along the exact line used in linear programming (LP), producing basic relationships that have compact forms almost identical to their counterparts in LP. We also introduce a new formulation of the central path and variable-metric measures of centrality. These results provide convenient tools for deriving polynomiality results for primal--dual algorithms extended from LP to SDP using the aforementioned and related search directions. We present examples of such extensions, including the long-step infeasible-interior-point algorithm of Zhang [SIAM J. Optim., 4 (1994), pp. 208--227]."

                "text": "Concerning a unified theory of obtaining sharp inequalities of Chebyshev's type, the author [5] used a geometrical method based on the theory of convex sets. The method used there and the results suggest tha t the problem has a close connection with the theory of linear programming. This would be well understood if we note that the logical structure of the problem is a type of linear programming. In fact, the constraints given by the expectations of some functions are linear constraints for an unknown probability distribution, and the object is to maximize or minimize the probability of a given event, which can be interpreted as a linear functional of probability distributions. From this point of view the problem of Chebyshev inequalities is regarded as a linear programming in the space of measures. On the other hand, the inequalities of Cram~r-Rao's type are interpreted as a convex programming in the space of statistics in the sense that it is required to minimize the variance--which is a convex functional of statistics--subject to the conditions of unbiasedness, which are linear constraints in statistics. From these points of view it is natural that we are inclined to t reat these problems as special cases of programming in abstract linear spaces. Unfortunately, there seems to be no literature that discusses the programming in abstract spaces under the situations sufficiently general to be applied to our problems. Hurwicz's ingenious paper [4] gives a comprehensive discussion on this subject, but the main concern is concentrated on characterizing the optimal points (the optimal allocations)from the econometrical point of view; besides the assumptions are too stringent to apply to our problems. We shall construct a general theory of programming in abstract spaces in the following section, in which, it should be emphasized, the author owes many materials to Hurwicz's paper. The formulation of concave programming in linear spaces is stated in the first place, and"

How accurate is Gaussian elimination and what were the key breakthroughs in the development of error analysis for the method? The answers to these and many related questions are included here. \nThis book gives a thorough, up-to-date treatment of the behavior of numerical algorithms in finite precision arithmetic. It combines algorithmic derivations, perturbation theory, and rounding error analysis. Software practicalities are emphasized throughout, with particular reference to LAPACK and MATLAB. The best available error bounds, some of them new, are presented in a unified format with a minimum of jargon. Because of its central role in revealing problem sensitivity and providing error bounds, perturbation theory is treated in detail. \nHistorical perspective and insight are given, with particular reference to the fundamental work of Wilkinson and Turing, and the many quotations provide further information in an accessible format. \nThe book is unique in that algorithmic developments and motivations are given succinctly and implementation details minimized, so that attention can be concentrated on accuracy and stability results. Here, in one place and in a unified notation, is error analysis for most of the standard algorithms in matrix computations. Not since Wilkinson's Rounding Errors in Algebraic Processes (1963) and The Algebraic Eigenvalue Problem (1965) has any volume treated this subject in such depth. A number of topics are treated that are not usually covered in numerical analysis textbooks, including floating point summation, block LU factorization, condition number estimation, the Sylvester equation, powers of matrices, finite precision behavior of stationary iterative methods, Vandermonde systems, and fast matrix multiplication. \nAlthough not designed specifically as a textbook, this volume is a suitable reference for an advanced course, and could be used by instructors at all levels as a supplementary text from which to draw examples, historical perspective, statements of results, and exercises (many of which have never before appeared in textbooks). The book is designed to be a comprehensive reference and its bibliography contains more than 1100 references from the research literature. \nAudience \nSpecialists in numerical analysis as well as computational scientists and engineers concerned about the accuracy of their results will benefit from this book. Much of the book can be understood with only a basic grounding in numerical analysis and linear algebra. \nAbout the Author \nNicholas J. Higham is a Professor of Applied Mathematics at the University of Manchester, England. He is the author of more than 40 publications and is a member of the editorial boards of the SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications and the IMA Journal of Numerical Analysis. His book Handbook of Writing for the Mathematical Sciences was published by SIAM in 1993."

Our approach is based on the generalization of the technique of finite-dimensional Euclidean Jordan algebras to the case of infinite-dimensional JB-algebras of finite rank. This generalization enables us to develop polynomial-time primal-dual algorithms for ``infinite-dimensional second-order cone programs.'' We consider as an example a long-step primal-dual algorithm based on the Nesterov-Todd direction. It is shown that this algorithm can be generalized along with complexity estimates to the infinite-dimensional situation under consideration. An application is given to an important problem of control theory: multi-criteria analytic design of the linear regulator. The calculation of the Nesterov-Todd direction requires in this case solving one matrix differential Riccati equation plus solving a finite-dimensional system of linear algebraic equations on each iteration. The number of equations and unknown variables of this algebraic system is m+1, where m is a number of quadratic performance criteria.\n"

As mathematical models invade more and more disciplines, we can anticipate a demand for eigenvalue calculations in an ever richer variety of contexts.' Anyone who performs these calculations will welcome the reprinting of Parlett's book (originally published in 1980). In this unabridged, amended version, Parlett covers aspects of the problem that are not easily found elsewhere. The chapter titles convey the scope of the material succinctly. The aim of the book is to present mathematical knowledge that is needed in order to understand the art of computing eigenvalues of real symmetric matrices, either all of them or only a few. The author explains why the selected information really matters and he is not shy about making judgments. The commentary is lively but the proofs are terse."

It uses a Taylor polynomial of second order to approximate a primal-dual trajectory. The computations for the second derivative are combined with the computations for the centering direction. Computations in this approach do not require that primal and dual solutions be feasible. Expressions are given to compute all the higher-order derivatives of the trajectory of interest. The implementation ensures that a suitable potential function is reduced by a constant amount at each iteration.There are several salient features of this approach. An adaptive heuristic for estimating the centering parameter is given. The approach used to compute the step length is also adaptive. A new practical approach to compute the starting point is given. This approach treats primal and dual problems symmetrically.Computational results on a subset of problems available from netlib are given. On mutually tested problems the results show..."

We seek \"robust\" solutions to such programs, that is, solutions which minimize the (worst-case) objective while satisfying the constraints for every possible value of parameters within the given bounds. Assuming the data matrices are rational functions of the perturbation parameters, we show how to formulate sufficient conditions for a robust solution to exist as SDPs. When the perturbation is \"full,\" our conditions are necessary and sufficient. In this case, we provide sufficient conditions which guarantee that the robust solution is unique and continuous (Holder-stable) with respect to the unperturbed problem's data. The approach can thus be used to regularize ill-conditioned SDPs. We illustrate our results with examples taken from linear programming, maximum norm minimization, polynomial interpolation, and integer programming."

It is defined as the problem of finding a pair $(\\X,\\Y)$ of $n \\times n$ symmetric positive semidefinite matrices which lies in a given $n(n+1)/2$ dimensional affine subspace $\\FC$ of $\\SC^2$ and satisfies the complementarity condition $\\X \\bullet \\Y = 0$, where $\\SC$ denotes the $n(n+1)/2$-dimensional linear space of symmetric matrices and $\\X \\bullet \\Y$ the inner product of $\\X$ and $\\Y$. The problem enjoys a close analogy with the LCP in the Euclidean space. In particular, the central trajectory leading to a solution of the problem exists under the nonemptiness of the interior of the feasible region and a monotonicity assumption on the affine subspace $\\FC$. The aim of this paper is to establish a theoretical basis of interior-point methods with the use of Newton directions toward the central trajectory for the monotone SDLCP."

We review classical barrier-function methods for nonlinear programming based on applying a logarithmic transformation to inequality constraints. For the special case of linear programming, the transformed problem can be solved by a \u201cprojected Newton barrier\u201d method. This method is shown to be equivalent to Karmarkar\u2019s projective method for a particular choice of the barrier parameter. We then present details of a specific barrier algorithm and its practical implementation. Numerical results are given for several non-trivial test problems, and the implications for future developments in linear programming are discussed."

This result has caused great excitement and stimulated a flood of technical papers. Ordinarily there would be no need for a survey of work so recent. The current circumstances are obviously exceptional. Word of Khachiyan''s result has spread extraordinarily fast, much faster than comprehension of its significance. A variety of issues have in general not been well understood, including the exact character of the ellipsoid method and of Khachiyan''s result on polynomiality, its practical significance in linear programming, its implementation, its potential applicability to problems outside of the domain of linear programming, and its relationship to earlier work. Our aim here is to help clarify these important issues in the context of a survey of the ellipsoid method, its historical antecedents, recent developments, and current research."

                "text": "Chapters 2\u20137 make up Part II of the book: artificial neural networks. After introducing the basic concepts of neurons and artificial neuron learning rules in Chapter 2, Chapter 3 describes a particular formalism, based on signal-plus-noise, for the learning problem in general. After presenting the basic neural network types this chapter reviews the principal algorithms for error function minimization/optimization and shows how these learning issues are addressed in various supervised models. Chapter 4 deals with issues in unsupervised learning networks, such as the Hebbian learning rule, principal component learning, and learning vector quantization. Various techniques and learning paradigms are covered in Chapters 3\u20136, and especially the properties and relative merits of the multilayer perceptron networks, radial basis function networks, self-organizing feature maps and reinforcement learning are discussed in the respective four chapters. Chapter 7 presents an in-depth examination of performance issues in supervised learning, such as accuracy, complexity, convergence, weight initialization, architecture selection, and active learning. Par III (Chapters 8\u201315) offers an extensive presentation of techniques and issues in evolutionary computing. Besides the introduction to the basic concepts in evolutionary computing, it elaborates on the more important and most frequently used techniques on evolutionary computing paradigm, such as genetic algorithms, genetic programming, evolutionary programming, evolutionary strategies, differential evolution, cultural evolution, and co-evolution, including design aspects, representation, operators and performance issues of each paradigm. The differences between evolutionary computing and classical optimization are also explained. Part IV (Chapters 16 and 17) introduces swarm intelligence. It provides a representative selection of recent literature on swarm intelligence in a coherent and readable form. It illustrates the similarities and differences between swarm optimization and evolutionary computing. Both particle swarm optimization and ant colonies optimization are discussed in the two chapters, which serve as a guide to bringing together existing work to enlighten the readers, and to lay a foundation for any further studies. Part V (Chapters 18\u201321) presents fuzzy systems, with topics ranging from fuzzy sets, fuzzy inference systems, fuzzy controllers, to rough sets. The basic terminology, underlying motivation and key mathematical models used in the field are covered to illustrate how these mathematical tools can be used to handle vagueness and uncertainty. This book is clearly written and it brings together the latest concepts in computational intelligence in a friendly and complete format for undergraduate/postgraduate students as well as professionals new to the field. With about 250 pages covering such a wide variety of topics, it would be impossible to handle everything at a great length. Nonetheless, this book is an excellent choice for readers who wish to familiarize themselves with computational intelligence techniques or for an overview/introductory course in the field of computational intelligence.

The patterns are usually represented by points in a Euclidean space. One way to achieve separation is to construct a plane or a nonlinear surface such that one set of patterns lies on one side of the plane or the surface, and the other set of patterns on the other side. Recently, it has been shown that linear and ellipsoidal separation may be achieved by nonlinear programming. In this work it is shown that both linear and nonlinear separation may be achieved by linear programming."

                "text": "This paper deals with a class of primal--dual interior-point algorithms for semidefinite programming (SDP) which was recently introduced by Kojima, Shindoh, and Hara [SIAM J. Optim., 7 (1997), pp. 86--125]. These authors proposed a family of primal-dual search directions that generalizes the one used in algorithms for linear programming based on the scaling matrix X1/2S-1/2. They study three primal--dual algorithms based on this family of search directions: a short-step path-following method, a feasible potential-reduction method, and an infeasible potential-reduction method. However, they were not able to provide an algorithm which generalizes the long-step path-following algorithm introduced by Kojima, Mizuno, and Yoshise [Progress in Mathematical Programming: Interior Point and Related Methods, N. Megiddor, ed., Springer-Verlag, Berlin, New York, 1989, pp. 29--47]. In this paper, we characterize two search directions within their family as being (unique) solutions of systems of linear equations in symmetric variables. Based on this characterization, we present a simplified polynomial convergence proof for one of their short-step path-following algorithms and, for the first time, a polynomially convergent long-step path-following algorithm for SDP which requires an extra $\\sqrt{n}$ factor in its iteration-complexity order as compared to its linear programming counterpart, where n is the number of rows (or columns) of the matrices involved."

The analytic center minimizes the \"average\" output error and allows an easy-to-compute sequential algorithm. With little computational effort two ellipsoids centered at the analytic center can be obtained as well: One inscribes and the other outscribes the so-called membership set. Finally, a sequential algorithm is presented along with its convergence proof. The complexity of this algorithm in terms of the maximum number of Newton iterations is shown to be linear in the number of observed data points."

Before any optimizing routine can be invoked, considerable effort must be expended to formulate the underlying model and to generate the requisite computational data structures. AMPL is a new language designed to make these steps easier and less error-prone. AMPL closely resembles the symbolic algebraic notation that many modelers use to describe mathematical programs, yet it is regular and formal enough to be processed by a computer system; it is particularly notable for the generality of its syntax and for the variety of its indexing operations. We have implemented an efficient translator that takes as input a linear AMPL model and associated data, and produces output suitable for standard linear programming optimizers. Both the language and the translator admit straightforward extensions to more general mathematical programs that incorporate nonlinear expressions or discrete variables."

The new method is suitable when a priori bounds on the uncertain data are available, and its solution leads to more meaningful results, especially when compared with other methods such as total least-squares and robust estimation. Its superior performance is due to the fact that the new method guarantees that the effect of the uncertainties will never be unnecessarily over-estimated, beyond what is reasonably assumed by the a priori bounds. A geometric interpretation of the solution is provided, along with a closed form expression for it. We also consider the case in which only selected columns of the coefficient matrix are subject to perturbations."

We discuss how the search directions for the Nesterov--Todd (NT) method can be computed efficiently and demonstrate how they can be viewed as Newton directions. This last observation also leads to convenient computation of accelerated steps, using the Mehrotra predictor-corrector approach, in the NT framework. We also provide an analytical and numerical comparison of several methods using different search directions, and suggest that the method using the NT direction is more robust than alternative methods."

                "text": "In the words of the authors, the goal of this book was to \u201cbring together many of the important new ideas in learning, and explain them in a statistical framework.\u201d The authors have been quite successful in achieving this objective, and their work is a welcome addition to the statistics and learning literatures. Statistics has always been interdisciplinary, borrowing ideas from diverse \u008e elds and repaying the debt with contributions, both theoretical and practical, to the other intellectual disciplines. For statistical learning, this cross-fertilization is especially noticeable. This book is a valuable resource, both for the statistician needing an introduction to machine learning and related \u008e elds and for the computer scientist wishing to learn more about statistics. Statisticians will especially appreciate that it is written in their own language. The level of the book is roughly that of a second-year doctoral student in statistics, and it will be useful as a textbook for such students. In a stimulating article, Breiman (2001) argued that statistics has been focused too much on a \u201cdata modeling culture,\u201d where the model is paramount. Breiman argued instead for an \u201calgorithmic modeling culture,\u201d with emphasis on black-box types of prediction. Breiman\u2019s article is controversial, and in his discussion, Efron objects that \u201cprediction is certainly an interesting subject, but Leo\u2019s paper overstates both its role and our profession\u2019s lack of interest in it.\u201d Although I mostly agree with Efron, I worry that the courses offered by most statistics departments include little, if any, treatment of statistical learning and prediction. (Stanford, where Efron and the authors of this book teach, is an exception.) Graduate students in statistics certainly need to know more than they do now about prediction, machine learning, statistical learning, and data mining (not disjoint subjects). I hope that graduate courses covering the topics of this book will become more common in statistics curricula. Most of the book is focused on supervised learning, where one has inputs and outputs from some system and wishes to predict unknown outputs corresponding to known inputs. The methods discussed for supervised learning include linear and logistic regression; basis expansion, such as splines and wavelets; kernel techniques, such as local regression, local likelihood, and radial basis functions; neural networks; additive models; decision trees based on recursive partitioning, such as CART; and support vector machines. There is a \u008e nal chapter on unsupervised learning, including association rules, cluster analysis, self-organizing maps, principal components and curves, and independent component analysis. Many statisticians will be unfamiliar with at least some of these algorithms. Association rules are popular for mining commercial data in what is called \u201cmarket basket analysis.\u201d The aim is to discover types of products often purchased together. Such knowledge can be used to develop marketing strategies, such as store or catalog layouts. Self-organizing maps (SOMs) involve essentially constrained k-means clustering, where prototypes are mapped to a two-dimensional curved coordinate system. Independent components analysis is similar to principal components analysis and factor analysis, but it uses higher-order moments to achieve independence, not merely zero correlation between components. A strength of the book is the attempt to organize a plethora of methods into a coherent whole. The relationships among the methods are emphasized. I know of no other book that covers so much ground. Of course, with such broad coverage, it is not possible to cover any single topic in great depth, so this book will encourage further reading. Fortunately, each chapter includes bibliographic notes surveying the recent literature. These notes and the extensive references provide a good introduction to the learning literature, including much outside of statistics. The book might be more suitable as a textbook if less material were covered in greater depth; however, such a change would compromise the book\u2019s usefulness as a reference, and so I am happier with the book as it was written."

The given problem is and the chosen representation involves where h is measurable on X x S (relative to the Borel structure on X) and convex in the X argument, and C is a nonempty closed subset of X. In order to apply the theory of integral functionals in \u00a7 9 at its fullest, we shall assume X is a separable, reflexive Banach space (whose dual is identifiable with V under the pairing <x, y\u00bb, and where the measure space is complete and has, of course, a(S) = 1.

We shall assume further that h(x, s) is finite and lowersemicontinuous in .v for all s, and h(u(s),s) is summable in 5 for every ueU. (If X = /?\", the latter assumption can be weakened to the summability of /j(x, s) in 5 for each x e X.)

                "text": "When a decision maker is assessing a preference (utility) function for assets (wealth), it is natural for him to start by making some quantitative assessments of the certainty equivalents of a few simple gambles and some qualitative statements specifying any regions in which he feels risk-averse or risk-seeking and any regions in which he feels decreasingly or increasingly risk-averse or risk-seeking. Several questions then arise. Does any preference function exist which satisfies all the quantitative and qualitative restrictions simultaneously, that is, are the restrictions consistent? If so, how far do they determine the preference function? How might one fair a \"smooth\" function satisfying the restrictions? This paper is addressed to these questions. First the problem is introduced in some detail, and the concepts involved reviewed. Then the case is considered where the qualitative restrictions only specify regions of risk-aversion or risk-seeking. It turns out in this case that all the restrictions are linear in certain quantities, so that the existence problem is essentially one of satisfying linear constraints. Furthermore, finding the maximum or minimum solution at a specified point is exactly a linear programming problem. Also discussed briefly are the possibility that some smoothing problems might simply introduce a nonlinear objective function (though the general smoothing problem is more complicated) and the problem of making the derivative of the preference function continuous (which is not always possible). If regions of increasing or decreasing risk-aversion are also given, the problem becomes much more difficult."

The authors point out that the maximization of individual wealth is not an ordinary problem in variational calculus, because the individual does not control, and may even be ignorant of, some of the variables. The general theory of social games, in their view, offers a simplified conceptual model of economic behaviour, and a study of that theory can do much to throw light on certain basic concepts of economics, for example, that of utility.Theory of Games and Economic BehaviorBy John Von Neumann Oskar Morgenstern.

Let S be the boundary of a convex body in the d-dimensional Euclidean space E (d \u2265 3). It is well known that S is an ellipsoid if and only if the section of S given by any hyperplane is ellipsoidal. The question of whether it is actually necessary to consider \u201cany\u201d hyperplane to characterize S as ellipsoid or is enough to consider \u201csome\u201d hyperplanes is at the origin of an important family of characterizations of ellipsoids. In that context, we study whether we can restrict the hyperplanes to those that are parallel to two or three fixed hyperplanes and also whether we can consider only hyperplanes that contain one of two fixed linear varieties.

Convex bodies K1, . . . , Kd \u2282 R are said to be well separated if aff{x1, . . . , xd} is a nondegenerate hyperplane for every x1 \u2208 K1, . . . , xd \u2208 Kd. The main result in this talk says that if K1, . . . , Kd are well separated convex bodies in R and \u03b11, . . . , \u03b1d \u2208 [0, 1], then there exists a unique oriented halfspace, H, such that |H \u2229 Ki| = \u03b1i|Ki| for every i = 1, . . . , d, where |K| denotes the volume of the convex body K. The result is extended from convex bodies to measures. Andr\u00e1s Bezdek. Auburn University, Auburn, AL. On iterative processes generating dense point sets. There are several results in the literature concerning iterative processes in the plane. A typical problem starts with the description of a geometric construction, which when applied to an initial point set generates larger point sets. The problem usually is to prove that repeated expansions lead to an everywhere dense point set. We refer to D. Ismailescu, who started to investigate the construction \u201cadd the circumcenters (CC) (incenters (IC), orthocenters (OC) respectively) of all nondegenerate triangles formed by existing points.\u201d In a joint paper Iorio, Ismailecsu, Radoicic and Silva solved the planar IC and the planar CC problem and stated conjectures concerning the planar OC problem. The talk outlines the solutions of the following versions: planar OC problem (with G. Ambrus, 2005) 3-dimensional IC problem (with G. Ambrus, 2006) hyperbolic and spherical IC problem (with T. Bisztriczky, 2006) iterative processes in lattices (2007). Ted Bisztriczky. University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada. Classification of bicyclic 4-polytopes."

                "text": "We consider a symmetric random walk on a connected graph, where each edge is labeled with the probability of transition between the two adjacent vertices. The associated Markov chain has a uniform equilibrium distribution; the rate of convergence to this distribution, i.e., the mixing rate of the Markov chain, is determined by the second largest eigenvalue modulus (SLEM) of the transition probability matrix. In this paper we address the problem of assigning probabilities to the edges of the graph in such a way as to minimize the SLEM, i.e., the problem of finding the fastest mixing Markov chain on the graph. \nWe show that this problem can be formulated as a convex optimization problem, which can in turn be expressed as a semidefinite program (SDP). This allows us to easily compute the (globally) fastest mixing Markov chain for any graph with a modest number of edges (say, $1000$) using standard numerical methods for SDPs. Larger problems can be solved by exploiting various types of symmetry and structure in the problem, and far larger problems (say, 100,000 edges) can be solved using a subgradient method we describe. We compare the fastest mixing Markov chain to those obtained using two commonly used heuristics: the maximum-degree method, and the Metropolis--Hastings algorithm. For many of the examples considered, the fastest mixing Markov chain is substantially faster than those obtained using these heuristic methods. \nWe derive the Lagrange dual of the fastest mixing Markov chain problem, which gives a sophisticated method for obtaining (arbitrarily good) bounds on the optimal mixing rate, as well as the optimality conditions. Finally, we describe various extensions of the method, including a solution of the problem of finding the fastest mixing reversible Markov chain, on a fixed graph, with a given equilibrium distribution."

                "text": "Solving sparse linear systems of equations is a common and important application of a multitude of scientific and engineering applications. The SPOOLES software package provides this functionality with a collection of software objects. The first step to solving a sparse linear system is to find a good low-fill ordering of the rows and columns. The library contains several ways to perform this operation: minimum degree, generalized nested dissection, and multisection. The second step is to factor the matrix as a product of triangular and diagonal matrices. The library supports pivoting for numerical stability (when required), approximation techniques to reduce the storage for and work to compute the matrix factors, and the computations are based on BLAS3 numerical kernels to take advantage of high performance computing architectures. The third step is to solve the linear system using the computed factors. The library is written in ANSI C using object oriented design. Good design and efficient code sometimes conflict; generally we have preferred to cater to design. For large sparse matrices the serial code outperforms its FORTRAN predecessors, the reverse holds for moderate sized matrices or those that do not have good block structure. The present release of the library contains a serial factorization and solve, a multithreaded version using the Solaris and Posix thread packages, and an MPI version. There is considerable code overlap between the serial, threaded and MPI versions. This release of the package is totally within the public domain; there are absolutely no licensing restrictions as with other software packages. The development of this software was funded by DARPA and the DoD with the express purpose that others (academic, government, industrial and commercial) could easily incorporate the data structures and algorithms into application codes. All we ask is an acknowledgement in derivative codes and any publications from research that uses this software. And, we hope that any improvements will be communicated to others. 1 SPOOLES is an acronym for SParse Object-Oriented Linear Equations Solver. DARPA Contract DABT63-95-C-0122.

Decomposition into overcomplete systems is not unique, and several methods for decomposition have been proposed, including the method of frames (MOF), Matching pursuit (MP), and, for special dictionaries, the best orthogonal basis (BOB). \nBasis Pursuit (BP) is a principle for decomposing a signal into an \"optimal\" superposition of dictionary elements, where optimal means having the smallest l1 norm of coefficients among all such decompositions. We give examples exhibiting several advantages over MOF, MP, and BOB, including better sparsity and superresolution. BP has interesting relations to ideas in areas as diverse as ill-posed problems, in abstract harmonic analysis, total variation denoising, and multiscale edge denoising. \nBP in highly overcomplete dictionaries leads to large-scale optimization problems. With signals of length 8192 and a wavelet packet dictionary, one gets an equivalent linear program of size 8192 by 212,992. Such problems can be attacked successfully only because of recent advances in linear programming by interior-point methods. We obtain reasonable success with a primal-dual logarithmic barrier method and conjugate-gradient solver."

The 'lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described."

Analogously he defines a convex surface bounded by a plane curve. His determination of arc lengths is based on certain postulates. One of these is: If one of two convex arcs with common endpoints lies between the other and the line joining the endpoints, the length of the first arc is smaller than that of the second. The determination of surface areas is founded on an analogous postulate."

It unifies worst-case design, nominal design and tolerance design in a single framework by selecting appropriate norms to measure the distances from the nominal values. The method uses an advanced first-order second moment technique as an alternative to the simplicial algorithm. Yield estimation is calculated in the original space and no transformation to uncorrelated variables is required. The solution algorithms are based on the recently developed interior-point methods for semi-definite programming. One tutorial and one practical example explain the application."

The formulation is used to design filters that achieve (a) the minimal bandwidth for a given filter length; (b) the minimal filter length for a given bandwidth; (c) the maximal robustness to timing error for a given bandwidth and filter length. Bandwidth is measured either in spectral energy concentration terms or with respect to a spectral mask.

For the circuit to meet a given clocking specification, it is necessary for each combinational stage to satisfy a certain delay requirement. Roughly speaking, increasing the sizes of some transistors in a stage reduces the delay, with the penalty of increased area. The problem of transistor sizing is to minimize the area of a combinational stage, subject to its delay being less than a given specification. Although this problem has been recognized as a convex programming problem, most existing approaches do not take full advantage of this fact, and often give nonoptimal results. An efficient convex optimization algorithm has been used here. This algorithm is guaranteed to find the exact solution to the convex programming problem. We have also improved upon existing methods for computing the circuit delay as an Elmore time constant, to achieve higher accuracy, CMOS circuit examples, including a combinational circuit with 832 transistors are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the new algorithm. >"

Unfortunately,ML detection (MLD) is a nondeterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) problem, for which there is no known algorithm that can find the optimal solution with polynomial-time complexity (in the number of users). In this paper, a polynomial-time approximation method called semi-definite (SD) relaxation is applied to the MLD problem with antipodal data transmission. SD relaxation is an accurate approximation method for certain NP-hard problems. The SD relaxation ML (SDR-ML) detector is efficient in that its complexity is of the order of K3.5, where K is the number of users. We illustrate the potential of the SDR-ML detector by showing that some existing detectors, such as the decorrelator and the linear-minimum-mean-square-error detector, can be interpreted as degenerate forms of the SDR-ML detector. Simulation results indicate that the BER performance of the SDR-ML detector is better than that of these existing detectors and is close to that of the true ML detector, even when the cross-correlations between users are strong or the near-far effect is significant."

We observe that a wide variety of design objectives and constraints have a special form, i.e., they are posynomial functions of the design variables. As a result, the amplifier design problem can be expressed as a special form of optimization problem called geometric programming, for which very efficient global optimization methods have been developed. As a consequence we can efficiently determine globally optimal amplifier designs or globally optimal tradeoffs among competing performance measures such as power, open-loop gain, and bandwidth. Our method, therefore, yields completely automated sizing of (globally) optimal CMOS amplifiers, directly from specifications. In this paper, we apply this method to a specific widely used operational amplifier architecture, showing in detail how to formulate the design problem as a geometric program. We compute globally optimal tradeoff curves relating performance measures such as power dissipation, unity-gain bandwidth, and open-loop gain. We show how the method can he used to size robust designs, i.e., designs guaranteed to meet the specifications for a variety of process conditions and parameters."

Without proper education MRP II and JIT=TQC will not be successful and will not generate their true bene\u00aets. Suppliers are key to the success of MRP II and JIT=TQC. They therefore need to understand these disciplines. Purchasing in the 21st century is going to be marked by continuous changes, by who can gain the competitive edge \u00aerst, who will be the most \u0304exible and who will build the best supplier relationships. This will only be achieved by following the process as described in Schorr in a step by step fashion. An organization must however be willing to, as Schorr states in Chapter 16, `create the spark, ignite change'! Only then can it happen! If you really want to know something about purchasing then this is the book to read. It is most de\u00aenitely relevant and more importantly up to date.

A process step in the use of this fluid is water washing of the surface to remove fluid which has not become entrapped in a surface discontinuity. During this step, fluid entrapped in shallow defects absorbs a relatively high percentage of water which activates the water-soluble dyestuff while fluid in deep defects remains substantially water free and the water-soluble dyestuff remains substantially inactive. Thus, shallow defects fluoresce the color of the water-soluble dyestuff and deep defects fluoresce the color of the oil-soluble dyestuff."

Let A be the sum of transistor sizes, T the longest delay through the circuit, and K a positive constant. Using a distributed RC model, each of the following three programs is shown to be convex: 1) Minimize A subject to T < K. 2) Minimize T subject to A < K. 3) Minimize AT K . The convex equations describing T are a particular class of functions called posynomials. Convex programs have many pleasant properties, and chief among these is the fact that any point found to be locally optimal is certain to be globally optimal TILOS (Timed Logic Synthesizer) is a program that sizes transistors in CMOS circuits. Preliminary results of TILOS\u2019s transistor sizing algorithm are presented."

The pivot shaft is transverse to and spaced from the axis of the driving disc. The driving disc is driven by a belt which, when placed under driving tension urges the carriage to pivot about its pivot shaft in a direction urging the friction driving disc against the driven friction wheels. Additionally, the carriage is urged by a pair of springs in the same direction to insure proper frictional engagement of the driving disc with the driven wheels. In order to insure proper proportioning of pressure exerted by the driving disc against the driven wheels, the driving disc support is pivoted to the carriage on an axis lying in the plane of the friction face of the driving disc and intersecting the axis of the driving disc. The biasing springs are connected to the driving disc support and are oriented in relation thereto in such a way as to insure normal driving pressure between the driving disc and the driven wheels throughout the range of axial shifting of the carriage on its pivot shaft. The carriage pivot shaft is connected at its opposite ends to spaced walls of the transmission housings in a manner permitting vertical adjustment of either or both ends. These adjustments permit proper alignment of the driving disc with the driven wheels. A clutching device is provided to disengage the driving disc from the driven wheels to provide free wheeling. The planetary unit is carried on a shaft mounted on the spaced walls of the transmission housing in a manner permitting removal of the planetary unit and shaft as an assembly."
