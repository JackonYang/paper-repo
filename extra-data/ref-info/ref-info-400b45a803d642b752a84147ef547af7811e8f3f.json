The idea of a frequency curve, for example, evidently implies an infinite hypothetical population distributed in a definite manner; but equally evidently the idea of an infinite hypothetical population requires a more precise logical specification than is contained in that phrase. The same may be said of the intimately connected idea of random sampling. These ideas have grown up in the minds of practical statisticians and lie at the basis especially of recent work; there can be no question of their pragmatic value. It was no part of my original intention to deal with the logical bases of these ideas, but some comments which Dr Burnside has kindly made have convinced me that it may be desirable to set out for criticism the manner in which I believe the logical foundations of these ideas may be established."

The general problems of specification and inference for time-series are then also briefly surveyed. To conclude Part I, the relation is examined between the information (entropy) concept used in communication theory, associated with specification, and Fisher's information concept used in statistics, associated with inference. In Part II some detailed methods of analysis are described with special reference to stationary time-series. The first method is concerned with the analysis of probability chains (in which the variable X can assume only a finite number of values or 'states', and the time t is discrete). The next section deals with autoregressive and autocorrelation analysis, for series defined either for discrete or continuous time, including proper allowance for sampling fluctuations; in particular, least-squares estimation of unknown coefficients in linear autogressive representations, and Quenouille's goodness of fit test for the correlogram, are illustrated. Harmonic or periodogram analysis is theoretically equivalent to autocorrelation analysis, but in the case of time-series with continuous spectra is valueless in practice without some smoothing device, owing to the peculiar distributional properties of the observed periodogram; one such arithmetical device is described in Section 7. Finally the precise use of the likelihood function (when available) is illustrated by reference to two different theoretical series giving rise to the same autocorrelation function."

If there are k independent variables, there are 2 k possible linear equations to be examined; one equation using none of the variables, k using one variable, k(k \u2013 1)/2 using two variables, etc. Often there are several equally good candidates. Selection depends on whether one needs a simple interpolation formula or estimates of the effects of individual independent variables. Fractional factorial designs for sampling the 2 k possibilities and a new statistic proposed by C. Mallows simplify the search for the best candidate. With the new statistic, regression equations can be compared graphically with respect to both bias and random error."
