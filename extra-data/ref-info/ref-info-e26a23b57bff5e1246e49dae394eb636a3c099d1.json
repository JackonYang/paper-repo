Traditional approaches to this problem rely on an edge-based discontinuity model, and have problems with transparent phenomena. The authors introduce a layered model of scene segmentation based on explicitly representing the support of a homogeneous region. The model employs parallel robust estimation techniques, and uses a minimal-covering optimization to estimate the number of objects in the scene. Using a simple direct motion model of translating objects, they successfully segment real image sequences containing multiple motions.<<ETX>>"

The image sequence can be decomposed into a set of overlapping layers, where each layer's motion is described by a smooth flow field. The discontinuities in the description are then attributed to object opacities rather than to the flow itself, mirroring the structure of the scene. A set of techniques is devised for segmenting images into coherently moving regions using affine motion analysis and clustering techniques. It is possible to decompose an image into a set of layers along with information about occlusion and depth ordering. The techniques are applied to a flower garden sequence. The scene can be analyzed into four layers, and, the entire 30-frame sequence can be represented with a single image of each layer, along with associated motion parameters.<<ETX>>"

The motion estimation problem is formulated as a time varying motion parameter estimation over multiple frames. Robust regression techniques are used to estimate these parameters. The motion parameters for the different moving objects are obtained by successive estimations on regions for which the previously estimated motion parameters are not valid. The segmentation module combines all motion parameters and the gray level information in order to obtain the motion boundaries and to improve them by using time integration. Experimental results on real image sequences with static or moving camera in the presence of multiple moving objects are reported."

This merging process raises many issues. These include the treatment of outliers in component velocity measurements and the modeling of multiple motions within a patch which arise from occlusion boundaries or transparency. A new approach for dealing with these issues is presented. It is based on the use of a probabilistic mixture model to explicitly represent multiple motions within a patch. A simple extension of the EM-algorithm is used to compute a maximum likelihood estimate for the various motion parameters. Preliminary experiments indicate that this approach is computationally efficient, and that it can provide robust estimates of the optical flow values in the presence of outliers and multiple motions.<<ETX>>"

The dominant background changes in the image plane mostly due to camera operations and motion (zoom, pan, tilt, track etc.). We address the problem of computation of the dominant image transformation over time and demonstrate how this can be effectively used for efficient video representation through video mosaicing and image registration. We formulate the problem of dominant component estimation as that of model based robust estimation using M estimators with direct, multi resolution methods. In addition to 2D affine and plane projective models, that have been used in the past for describing image motion using direct methods, we also employ a true 3D model of motion and scene structure imaged with uncalibrated cameras. This model parameterizes the image motion as that due to a planar component and a parallax component. For rigid 3D scenes imaged under camera motion only, least squares (LS) methods with the plane and parallax parameterization are also presented. Furthermore, in the context of robust estimation, in contrast with previous approaches for similar problems, our algorithm employs an automatic computation of a scale parameter that is crucial in rejecting the non dominant components as outliers.<<ETX>>"

Image motion is represented by layers-image regions whose coherent motion can be approximated by some parametric motion model. The motion at every point is obtained by the parametric motion estimate of the entire layer, corrected by a residual flow which captures the difference between the real image motion and the layer's motion model. The new approach is able to construct accurate flow fields in the presence of multiple motions, motion boundaries, and transparent motions."

The approach exploits brightness information to organize and constrain the interpretation of the motion by using segmented regions of piecewise smooth brightness to hypothesize planar regions in the scene. Parametric flow models are fitted to these regions an a two step process which first computes a coarse fit and then refines it using a generalization of the standard area-based regression approaches. Since the assumption of planarity is likely to be violated, we allow local deformations from the planar assumption. This parametric+deformation model exploits the strong constraints of parametric approaches while retaining the adaptive nature of regularization approaches.<<ETX>>"

The MPEG flower garden sequence is decomposed into a set of four static layer images. Given these four images and a small number of motion parameters, one can resynthesize the original 30-frame sequence remarkably well.<<ETX>>"

A novel combination of the Hough Transform, and robust statistical methods results in unbiased estimates for multiple motions, parallel segmentation and estimation and increased robustness to noise and changes of illumination. The algorithm is fast, due to application of multiresolution in both image and parameter space. A simple, translational motion model and a complex one coping with rotation and change of scale are applied. Also, an accuracy measure for the derived estimate is introduced. The paper includes experimental tests of this new approach and its comparison with several other widely-cited methods. The experiments were aimed at assessing the effect of noise, change of illumination and multiple motions on the algorithms performance. The results show that our approach is significantly more robust than other methods.<<ETX>>"

                "text": "Motion in image sequences can result from the motion of the observer (egomotion) and from the presence of independently moving objects (IMOs) within the field of view of the observer. Any vision system intended for all observer capable of motion needs the ability to distinguish between these two possibilities in order to successfully perform navigation and collision avoidance tasks. \nOne approach to motion segmentation is to perform a statistical clustering on a set of local constraints on 3-D motion in the image. This thesis proposes two new methods, based on the EM algorithm, to perform robust motion segmentation on image sequences that contain IMOs. The first method uses statistical clustering of linear and bilinear constraints (derived from computed optical flow using subspace methods) on 3-D translation and rotation. The problems of outlier detection and determining number of processes and their initial parameters for the EM algorithm are considered. Also, analysis of the effects of IMO boundaries on linear constraints, as well as a derivation for the removal of bias inherent in translation estimates from linear constraints, are presented. Effects of fixation on detection of IMOs are considered. A framework for hypothesizing about motions underlying a set of constraint clusters is detailed. \nThere exist situations in which 3-D motion constraints are not sufficient to perform segmentation. The second method tracks depth-structure over time and evaluates rigidity allowing IMOs to be identified as outliers. \nResults obtained from four image sequences are presented. The first sequence is synthetic optic flow generated from a depth map and contains one IMO. The second sequence was captured from a robot moving in an industrial environment. The third sequence is similar to the second, except the flow has been generated using a regularly spaced grid which assumes no prior segmentation of the image. The fourth sequence illustrates a case in which the 3-D constraints are insufficient to perform the segmentation, and the estimation of depth structure is needed to solve the problem. \nFinally, directions for future research into this problem are presented."

For linear approximations to perspective projection (weak/para perspective), and for the case of image velocities, elegant linear methods have been devised for robust estimation. For reconstruction under arbitrary view transformations, linear projective methods using point correspondences have been suggested. In this paper, the authors present a formulation for 3D motion and structure analysis using motion parallax defined with respect to an arbitrary plane in the environment. It is shown that if an image coordinate system is warped using plane projective transformation with respect to a reference view, the residual image motion is dependent only on the epipoles and has a simple relation to the 3D structure. The author's computational scheme avoids point/line correspondence and is based on hierarchical estimation and image warping working directly with spatio-temporal image intensities. Results on real images demonstrate how this analysis simplifies ego and multiple motion analysis, and stable scene-centered 3D reconstruction."

The method assumes that the distribution of image intensities associated with each tissue type can be expressed as a multivariate likelihood function of three weighted signal intensity values (T(1), T(2), P(D)) at each location within that tissue regions. The method further assumes that the underlying tissue regions are piecewise contiguous and can be characterized by a Markov random field prior. In classifying the tissue types, the method models the likelihood of realizing the images as a finite multivariate-mixture function. The class parameters associated with the tissue types (i.e. the weighted intensity means, variances and correlation coefficients of the multivariate function, as well as the number of voxels within regions of the tissue types of are estimated by maximum likelihood. The estimation fits the class parameters to the image data via the expectation-maximization algorithm. The number of classes associated with the tissue types is determined by the information criterion of minimum description length. The method segments the tissue regions, given the estimated class parameters, by maximum a posteriori probability. The prior is constructed by the tissue-region membership of the first- and second-order neighborhood. The method is tested by a few sets of T(1), T(2), and P(D) weighted images of the brain acquired with a 1.5 Tesla whole body scanner. The number of classes and the associated class parameters are automatically estimated. The regions of different brain tissues are satisfactorily segmented."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."

                "text": "of the number of bits required to write down the observed data, has been reformulated to extend the classical maximum likelihood principle. The principle permits estimation of the number of the parameters in statistical models in addition to their values and even of the way the parameters appear in the models; i.e., of the model structures. The principle rests on a new way to interpret and construct a universal prior distribution for the integers, which makes sense even when the parameter is an individual object. Truncated realvalued parameters are converted to integers by dividing them by their precision, and their prior is determined from the universal prior for the integers by optimizing the precision. 1. Introduction. In this paper we study estimation based upon the principle of minimizing the total number of binary digits required to rewrite the observed data, when each observation is given with some precision. Instead of attempting at an absolutely shortest description, which would be futile, we look for the optimum relative to a class of parametrically given distributions. This Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, which we introduced in a less comprehensive form in [25], turns out to degenerate to the more familiar Maximum Likelihood (ML) principle in case the number of parameters in the models is fixed, so that the description length of the parameters themselves can be ignored. In another extreme case, where the parameters determine the data, it similarly degenerates to Jaynes's principle of maximum entropy, [14]. But the main power of the new criterion is that it permits estimates of the entire model, its parameters, their number, and even the way the parameters appear in the model; i.e., the model structure. Hence, there will be no need to supplement the estimated parameters with a separate hypothesis test to decide whether a model is adequately parameterized or, perhaps, over parameterized."
