An algorithm is described for solving template-layout problems with a digital computer. The method of solution requires that the irregular shapes be enclosed, singly or in combination, in minimum area rectangles called modules. Individual modules will contain from one to perhaps eight optimally fitted irregular pieces. The modules are then packed into the given stock sheet(s) so as to optimize a specified objective function. The packing is carried out with a dynamic programming algorithm, which converts the multivariable problem into a multistage one. Successive iterations of the algorithm are used to determine whether higher order modules (containing more irregular-shaped pieces) improve the solution. A detailed description of the algorithm is given. An illustrative example is included and its computer solution is described. The paper concludes with an extension of the algorithm to an improved version which can be expected to yield solutions more closely approaching the true optimum."

It is shown that one can determine through the use of relatively simple numerical techniques whether a given arbitrary plane curve is open or closed, whether it is singly or multiply connected, and what area it encloses. Further, one can cause a given figure to be expanded, contracted, elongated, or rotated by an arbitrary amount. It is shown that there are a number of ways of encoding arbitrary geometric curves to facilitate such manipulations, each having its own particular advantages and disadvantages. One method, the so-called rectangular-array type of encoding, is discussed in detail. In this method the slope function is quantized into a set of eight standard slopes. This particular representation is one of the simplest and one that is most readily utilized with present-day computing and display equipment."

The subjective aspects of a line drawing are examined. Different encoding schemes are compared, with emphasis on the so-called chain code which is convenient for highly irregular line drawings. The properties of chain-coded line drawings are derived, and algorithms are developed for analyzing line drawings to determine various geometric features. Procedures are described for rotating, expanding, and smoothing line structures, and for establishing the degree of similarity between two contours by a correlation technique. Three applications are described in detail: automatic assembly of jigsaw puzzles, map matching, and optimum two-dimensional template layout"
