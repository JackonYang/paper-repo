The algorithm directly maximizes a stochastic variant of the leave-one-out KNN score on the training set. It can also learn a low-dimensional linear embedding of labeled data that can be used for data visualization and fast classification. Unlike other methods, our classification model is non-parametric, making no assumptions about the shape of the class distributions or the boundaries between them. The performance of the method is demonstrated on several data sets, both for metric learning and linear dimensionality reduction."

We show that when the metric we learn is used in simple classifiers, it yields substantial improvements over standard alternatives on a variety of problems.

A Gaussian is centered on each object in the high-dimensional space and the densities under this Gaussian (or the given dissimilarities) are used to define a probability distribution over all the potential neighbors of the object. The aim of the embedding is to approximate this distribution as well as possible when the same operation is performed on the low-dimensional \"images\" of the objects. A natural cost function is a sum of Kullback-Leibler divergences, one per object, which leads to a simple gradient for adjusting the positions of the low-dimensional images. Unlike other dimensionality reduction methods, this probabilistic framework makes it easy to represent each object by a mixture of widely separated low-dimensional images. This allows ambiguous objects, like the document count vector for the word \"bank\", to have versions close to the images of both \"river\" and \"finance\" without forcing the images of outdoor concepts to be located close to those of corporate concepts."

In this paper, we show how to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric for kNN classification from labeled examples. The Mahalanobis metric can equivalently be viewed as a global linear transformation of the input space that precedes kNN classification using Euclidean distances. In our approach, the metric is trained with the goal that the k-nearest neighbors always belong to the same class while examples from different classes are separated by a large margin. As in support vector machines (SVMs), the margin criterion leads to a convex optimization based on the hinge loss. Unlike learning in SVMs, however, our approach requires no modification or extension for problems in multiway (as opposed to binary) classification. In our framework, the Mahalanobis distance metric is obtained as the solution to a semidefinite program. On several data sets of varying size and difficulty, we find that metrics trained in this way lead to significant improvements in kNN classification. Sometimes these results can be further improved by clustering the training examples and learning an individual metric within each cluster. We show how to learn and combine these local metrics in a globally integrated manner."

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind."

The method can be used for recognition or verification applications where the number of categories is very large and not known during training, and where the number of training samples for a single category is very small. The idea is to learn a function that maps input patterns into a target space such that the L/sub 1/ norm in the target space approximates the \"semantic\" distance in the input space. The method is applied to a face verification task. The learning process minimizes a discriminative loss function that drives the similarity metric to be small for pairs of faces from the same person, and large for pairs from different persons. The mapping from raw to the target space is a convolutional network whose architecture is designed for robustness to geometric distortions. The system is tested on the Purdue/AR face database which has a very high degree of variability in the pose, lighting, expression, position, and artificial occlusions such as dark glasses and obscuring scarves."

Given a regression or classification problem in which we wish to predict a response variable Y from an explanatory variable X, we treat the problem of dimensionality reduction as that of finding a low-dimensional \"effective subspace\" for X which retains the statistical relationship between X and Y. We show that this problem can be formulated in terms of conditional independence. To turn this formulation into an optimization problem we establish a general nonparametric characterization of conditional independence using covariance operators on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. This characterization allows us to derive a contrast function for estimation of the effective subspace. Unlike many conventional methods for dimensionality reduction in supervised learning, the proposed method requires neither assumptions on the marginal distribution of X, nor a parametric model of the conditional distribution of Y. We present experiments that compare the performance of the method with conventional methods."

The model can be represented by a particular type of Boltzmann machine with a bipartite graph structure that we call the combination machine. This machine is closely related to the Harmonium model defined by Smolensky. In the first part of the paper we analyze properties of this distribution representation scheme. We show that arbitrary distributions of binary vectors can be approximated by the combination model. We show how the weight vectors in the model can be interpreted as high order correlation patterns among the input bits, and how the combination machine can be used as a mechanism for detecting these patterns. We compare the combination model with the mixture model and with principle component analysis. In the second part of the paper we present two algorithms for learning the combination model from examples. The first learning algorithm is the standard gradient ascent heuristic for computing maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters of the model. Here we give a closed form for this gradient that is significantly easier to compute than the corresponding gradient for the general Boltzmann machine. The second learning algorithm is a greedy method that creates the hidden units and computes their weights one at a time. This method is a variant of projection pursuit density estimation. In the third part of the paper we give experimental results for these learning methods on synthetic data and on natural data of handwritten digit images."

We show how the external teacher can be replaced by internally derived teaching signals. These signals are generated by using the assumption that different parts of the perceptual input have common causes in the external world. Small modules that look at separate but related parts of the perceptual input discover these common causes by striving to produce outputs that agree with each other (Fig. la). The modules may look at different modalities (such as vision and touch), or the same modality at different times (for example, the consecutive two-dimensional views of a rotating three-dimensional object), or even spatially adjacent parts of the same image. Our simulations show that when our learning procedure is applied to adjacent patches of two-dimensional images, it allows a neural network that has no prior knowledge of the third dimension to discover depth in random dot stereograms of curved surfaces."

One approach consists of using generic truths about the spatiotemporal structure of the physical world as constraints on the types of quantities learned. The learning methodology employed here embodies one such truth: that perceptually salient properties (such as stereo disparity) tend to vary smoothly over time. Unfortunately, the units of an artificial neural network tend to encode superficial image properties, such as individual grey-level pixel values, which vary rapidly over time. However, if the states of units are constrained to vary slowly, then the network is forced to learn a smoothly varying function of the training data. We implemented this temporal-smoothness constraint in a backpropagation network which learned stereo disparity from random-dot stereograms. Temporal smoothness was formalised with the use of regularisation theory by modifying the standard cost function minimised during training of a network. Temporal smoothness was found to be similar to other techniques for improving generalisation, such as early stopping and weight decay. However, in contrast to these, the theoretical underpinnings of temporal smoothing are intimately related to fundamental characteristics of the physical world. Results are discussed in terms of regularisation theory and the physically realistic assumptions upon which temporal smoothing is based."

We propose to use the RCA algorithm, which is a simple and efficient algorithm for learning a full ranked Mahalanobis metric (Shental et al., 2002). We first show that RCA obtains the solution to an interesting optimization problem, founded on an information theoretic basis. If the Mahalanobis matrix is allowed to be singular, we show that Fisher's linear discriminant followed by RCA is the optimal dimensionality reduction algorithm under the same criterion. We then show how this optimization problem is related to the criterion optimized by another recent algorithm for metric learning (Xing et al., 2002), which uses the same kind of side information. We empirically demonstrate that learning a distance metric using the RCA algorithm significantly improves clustering performance, similarly to the alternative algorithm. Since the RCA algorithm is much more efficient and cost effective than the alternative, as it only uses closed form expressions of the data, it seems like a preferable choice for the learning of full rank Mahalanobis distances."

In this paper we learn distance functions by training binary classifiers with margins. The classifiers are defined over the product space of pairs of points and are trained to distinguish whether two points come from the same class or not. The signed margin is used as the distance value. Our main contribution is a distance learning method (DistBoost), which combines boosting hypotheses over the product space with a weak learner based on partitioning the original feature space. Each weak hypothesis is a Gaussian mixture model computed using a semi-supervised constrained EM algorithm, which is trained using both unlabeled and labeled data. We also consider SVM and decision trees boosting as margin based classifiers in the product space. We experimentally compare the margin based distance functions with other existing metric learning methods, and with existing techniques for the direct incorporation of constraints into various clustering algorithms. Clustering performance is measured on some benchmark databases from the UCI repository, a sample from the MNIST database, and a data set of color images of animals. In most cases the DistBoost algorithm significantly and robustly outperformed its competitors."

For instance, data can often be clustered in many \"plausible\" ways, and if a clustering algorithm such as K-means initially fails to find one that is meaningful to a user, the only recourse may be for the user to manually tweak the metric until sufficiently good clusters are found. For these and other applications requiring good metrics, it is desirable that we provide a more systematic way for users to indicate what they consider \"similar.\" For instance, we may ask them to provide examples. In this paper, we present an algorithm that, given examples of similar (and, if desired, dissimilar) pairs of points in \u211dn, learns a distance metric over \u211dn that respects these relationships. Our method is based on posing metric learning as a convex optimization problem, which allows us to give efficient, local-optima-free algorithms. We also demonstrate empirically that the learned metrics can be used to significantly improve clustering performance."

Although this approach has met with considerable success, the causal semantics of these models can make it difficult to infer the posterior distribution over the hidden variables. In this paper we propose an alternative two-layer model based on exponential family distributions and the semantics of undirected models. Inference in these \"exponential family harmoniums\" is fast while learning is performed by minimizing contrastive divergence. A member of this family is then studied as an alternative probabilistic model for latent semantic indexing. In experiments it is shown that they perform well on document retrieval tasks and provide an elegant solution to searching with keywords."

This way of combining individual expert models makes it hard to generate samples from the combined model but easy to infer the values of the latent variables of each expert, because the combination rule ensures that the latent variables of different experts are conditionally independent when given the data. A product of experts (PoE) is therefore an interesting candidate for a perceptual system in which rapid inference is vital and generation is unnecessary. Training a PoE by maximizing the likelihood of the data is difficult because it is hard even to approximate the derivatives of the renormalization term in the combination rule. Fortunately, a PoE can be trained using a different objective function called contrastive divergence whose derivatives with regard to the parameters can be approximated accurately and efficiently. Examples are presented of contrastive divergence learning using several types of expert on several types of data."

This rule is independent of the underlying joint distribution on the sample points and their classifications, and hence the probability of error R of such a rule must be at least as great as the Bayes probability of error R^{\\ast} --the minimum probability of error over all decision rules taking underlying probability structure into account. However, in a large sample analysis, we will show in the M -category case that R^{\\ast} \\leq R \\leq R^{\\ast}(2 --MR^{\\ast}/(M-1)) , where these bounds are the tightest possible, for all suitably smooth underlying distributions. Thus for any number of categories, the probability of error of the nearest neighbor rule is bounded above by twice the Bayes probability of error.

                "text": "Abstract : At this early stage in the development of cognitive science, methodological issues are both open and central. There may have been times when developments in neuroscience, artificial intelligence, or cognitive psychology seduced researchers into believing that their discipline was on the verge of discovering the secret of intelligence. But a humbling history of hopes disappointed has produced the realization that understanding the mind will challenge the power of all these methodologies combined. The work reported in this chapter rests on the conviction that a methodology that has a crucial role to play in the development of cognitive science is mathematical analysis. The success of cognitive science, like that of many other sciences, will, I believe, depend upon the construction of a solid body of theoretical results: results that express in a mathematical language the conceptual insights of the field; results that squeeze all possible implications out of those insights by exploiting powerful mathematical techniques. This body of results, which I will call the theory of information processing, exists because information is a concept that lends itself to mathematical formalization. One part of the theory of information processing is already well-developed. The classical theory of computation provides powerful and elegant results about the notion of effective procedure, including languages for precisely expressing them and theoretical machines for realizing them."
