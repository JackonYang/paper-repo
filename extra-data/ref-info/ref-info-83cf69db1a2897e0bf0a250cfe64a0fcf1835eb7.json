The drop in threshold was rather small compared to that found in human dark adaptation, and the final threshold reached was not nearly as low as one would expect in an eye adapted for nocturnal vision. Pirenne (1954) has emphasized that there is a big discrepancy (a factor of 103-106) between the lowest threshold obtained by electro-physiological methods and the much lower thresholds found by psychophysical methods in humans (Hecht, Shlaer & Pirenne, 1942). In addition, the existence of a random maintained discharge from retinal ganglion cells (Kuffler, FitzHugh & Barlow, 1957) raises some doubts about the relative parts played by the retina and the central nervous system in determining thresholds. We therefore set out to measure the absolute threshold of the large type of ganglion cell (Rushton, 1949) isolated by metallic micro-electrodes of the type used by Granit & Svaetichin (1939). The opportunity was taken of following threshold through the period of dark adaptation, and some observations of the Purkinje shift were made."

                "text": "THE DISCHARGES carried in the optic nerve fibers contain all the information which the central nervous system receives from the retina. A correct interpretation of discharge patterns therefore constitutes an important step in the analysis of visual events. Further, investigations of nervous activity arising in the eye reveal many aspects of the functional organization of the neural elements within the retina itself. Following studies of discharges in the optic nerve of the eel\u2019s eye by Adrian and Matthews (2,3), Hartline and his colleagues described the discharge pattern in the eye of the Limulus in a series of important and lucid papers (for a summary see 20). In the Limulus the relationship between the stimulus to the primary receptor cell and the nerve discharges proved relatively simple, apparently because the connection between sense cell and nerve fiber was a direct one. Thus, when stimulation is confined to one receptor the discharge in a single Limulus nerve fiber will provide a good indication of excitatory events which take place as a result of photochemical processes. Discharges last for the duration of illumination and their frequency is a measure of stimulus strength. Lately, however, it was shown by Hartline et al. (22) that inhibitory interactions may be revealed when several receptors are excited. On the whole, the Limulus preparation shows many features which are similar to other simple sense organs, for instance, stretch receptors. In the latter, however, instead of photochemical events, stretch-deformation acts as the adequate stimulus on sensory terminals and is translated into a characteristic discharge pattern. The discharge from the cold-blooded vertebrate retina (mainly frogs) proved much more complex. Hartline found three main types when recording from single optic nerve fibers: (i) \u201con\u201d discharges, similar to those in the Limulus, firing for the duration of the light stimulus, (ii) \u201coff\u201d discharges appearing when a light stimulus was withdrawn, and (iii) \u2018con-off\u201d discharges, a combination of the former two, with activity confined mainly to onset and cessation of illumination. The mammalian discharge patterns were studied in a number of species by Granit and his co-workers in the course of their extensive work on the physiology of the visual system (summaries in 13, 15). On the whole, they did not observe any fundamental differences between frog and mammalian discharge types (see later)."

It has been possible in many types of visual sense organ to record nerve impulse discharges set up by the stimulus of light ; in work on a simple eye (Limulus), Hartline showed that visual sense cells, like other sensory nerve endings that have been investigated, set up impulses of frequency related to the strength of the stimulus, and Hartline later confirmed this for single opticnerve fibres from the frog's retina. But here the response was complicated by fibres responding when the light was extinguished\u2014the well-known off-discharge found by Adrian and R. Matthews in the eel's optic nerve.

Ten flashes at each of several intensities near threshold were used. 2. For the purpose of statistical analysis, the number of impulses (x) falling within a critical period following each flash was used as an index of the response. Histograms of x were plotted and used to calculate rates of transfer of information by the ganglion cell for the case of an ideal experiment, the yes-no choice, in which flashes of intensity I and blanks are to be distinguished. 3. The information rate increased (a) with increasing stimulus intensity and (b) with the number of identical flashes or blanks presented successively in a block. The intensity chosen as threshold by the experimenter, who observed the impulses visually and aurally, corresponded to an average information rate for single flashes of 0.7 bit/flash, compared to the maximum possible rate of 1 bit/flash. A threshold intensity giving 0.4 or more bit/flash, if presented in blocks of six identical flashes, corresponded to 0.95 or more bit/block, or near certainty. Thus the calculation of information rates using the index x provides an estimate of threshold at least as sensitive as those obtained during an experiment, which were made only after observing the responses to five to ten flashes of the same intensity. 4. The index x has statistical properties similar to those of the \"index of neural activity\" used by Tanner and Swets (1954) in their statistical model of human vision, and represents a possible physical interpretation of their index. However, x gave values (0.5 to 1.5) of the parameter called the slope which were consistently smaller than their values (2.1 to 3.1)."

                "text": "The discharge of impulses from the muscle spindle of the frog, when subjected to a constant mechanical stimulus (stretch), may show great irregularity. This is most noticeable when the muscle is near its resting length. The mean rate of impulses is then very low, and successive intervals appear to vary in a random manner. As the muscle is stretched, the rate of afferent discharge increases and irregularities become less obvious (Matthews, 1931). A possible explanation of the random discharge at low frequency has been suggested by Katz (1950a, b), on the basis of observations on single sensory nerve endings. Depolarization of the terminal branches of an axon in a muscle spindle was found to be responsible for the initiation of sensory impulses, the rate of the discharges depending upon the intensity of the local potential change. Fluctuations of the level of depolarization would therefore cause irregularity of the intervals between successive impulses. Such fluctuations of potential might be due directly to thermal agitation of ions in the nerve terminals, or they might be produced indirectly by molecular agitation in the mechanical receptor substance. At present, little is known about the mechanical receptor system, but the effects of thermal agitation in nerve endings can be subjected to a tentative theoretical analysis (see Fatt & Katz, 1952). Thus, the finer the diameter of a fibre, the larger will be the amplitude of 'voltage noise' at the terminal. For example, for an extremely fine ending, 0-1 ,u in diameter, a voltage fluctuation of the order of 0 5 mV r.m.s. has been estimated. The present experiments were planned to investigate whether this simple source of physical random disturbance could explain the observed fluctuations of impulse discharge. The irregularity was measured over a large range of frequencies of firing, applying various amounts of stretch to the muscle."

The present investigation is an extension to the cochlear nucleus in the medulla oblongata of the same technique of recording action potentials with submicroscopic microelectrodes (6). Action potentials from single elements in the cochlear nucleus have already been successfully recorded by Galambos and Davis (2, 3, 4) with an earlier type of microelectrode. The original purpose of the present investigation was to repeat their previous observations with a finer technique. There is a certain difference in behavior between the elements examined in the present investigation and those studied previously. The \u201cresponse area\u201d of an element is the area on an intensity-frequency plot that includes all tones that evoke a positive response. The response areas of the new elements show a sharp limit on the high-frequency side and very gradual elevation of threshold on the low-frequency side. The elements studied previously had, on the contrary, fairly narrow response areas with a clear maximum of sensitivity for a certain frequency that was characteristic of the element under observation. The new and the previous elements behaved differently in one other aspect: spontaneous discharges of impulses in the new elements were not inhibited by the application of any pure tone, while in the previous elements some tones inhibited and other tones enhanced the spontaneous repetitive activity."

One feature of particular interest was the occurrence of rhythmic potential oscillations in the ganglion and of rhythmic bursts of impulses in the nerve, due apparently to synchronous activity in the nerve cells. The tendency to synchronization is now recognized to play a considerable part in the reactions of the cerebral cortex, and it has become important to know more about the conditions which promote it. The optic ganglion of Dytiscus is in some ways an ideal preparation for a study of this kind. It has a relatively complex structureindeed according to Zawarzin [1914] it is equivalent to the retina and optic lobes of a vertebrate-but its electrical reactions are simple and there is the great advantage that its activity can be readily controlled. It has therefore been re-examined in the hope that the results would show what might be expected of nerve cells in general. Although they illustrate a principle which has been invoked before, many of the results can be simply explained and they suggest an explanation for some of the reactions of the cerebral cortex."

An attempt has been made here to throw further light on these problems by studying the electrical changes in a sensory nerve fibre at a point close to its peripheral terminals. It is clear that only the last aspect of the problem (c) is directly amenable to electrical investigation, but such a study may also provide important clues to the preceding links of the process (a and b). A suitable preparation was obtained from the muscle spindle of the frog. The electric response in the sensory axon close to the spindle differs in certain respects from a simple nerve spike, and some of these features can be related to the local events which take place in the sense organ. In the present paper the action potential in the terminal portions of the fibre will be described. It will also be shown that the initiation of an impulse at a sensory nerve ending does not invariably lead to a propagated message in the main axon. In the following paper, stretching of the muscle will be shown to depolarize the sensory nerve endings and thereby give rise to a repetitive discharge of impulses."

                "text": "The function of the lateral-line organ of Japanese eel has been examined precisely by means of recording the impulse discharges from a single nerve fiber supplying the organ, which was activated by various kinds of natural and artificial stimulations. The results obtained are summarised, as follows.1) Examinations by water flow.With a calm water flow only thin nerve fibers could be excited. Somewhat higher rates of flow first excite the thicker fibers. The aspect of discharges was not changed by the direction of the water flow. The number of discharges from a single nerve fiber increased with increase of the flow rate. The maximum discharge frequency attained was different in fibers with different diameters. The relation between the average number of spikes and the logarithm of the flow rate was nearly linear in every single fiber examined.2) Examinations by pressure and touch.Applying pressures of various grades on the skin surface along the lateralline, results were obtained, which were similar to those above mentioned qualitatively and quantitatively. However, some very thick fibers of phasic nature were' very sensitive to the impulse shock and had a relatively low thresholds. They showed sometimes inhibitory phenomena during stimulation, and facilitatoryeffect after the cessation of the stimulation. The lateral-line organ of fish has, too, a dual innervation of slow and phasic fibers, as many other sensory organs have.3) Examination by mechanical vibrations.In all fibers examined, the discharges were seen to appear in every cycle of mechanical vibrations, provided that the vibration frequency was relatively low. With very low frequencies we had generally a few spikes in each cycle, which changed into one-for-one relation in the middle range of frequency (20-50 cps.). When the stimulus frequency was further increased, there appeared the discharge deficit oftener, the more frequent the stimulus. The largest frequency producing one-for-one appearance of the spikes was different in different fibers, owing to the different diameters. The thicker the fiber the higher it was. The thinnest fiber could follow the vibrations of under 10 cps. only. On the contrary most of the thicker fibers could follow those of 50 cps., and the thickest one even to those near 100 cps.4) The D. C. stimulation of the receptor easily evokes the iterative firing of the nerve fiber. The average number of spikes had a linear relationship with the logarithm of the current strength. The threshold for repetitive discharges could not be determined precisely, but it was certain that weak currents made the thinner fibers discharge more easily than the thicker fibers. Many fibers were excited by the ingoing current and a few by the outgoing one.5) The A. C. stimulation of the receptor evoked, also, discharges in every stimulus cycle. For the low stimulus frequency there were a few spikes in the negative phase only. With the increase of the stimulus frequency the number of spikes in one stimulus cycle decreased gradually, to become the one-for-one appearance, to random falling out of the spikes, and finally to a stage where there resulted only one impulse in many stimulus cycles. The maximum frequency for one-for-one appearance of the spikes was related to the fiber diameter, the thicker fiber being able to follow a higher frequency. The upper limit could not be determined owing to the disturbances brought by the stimulus current itself.The strength of the stimulating current caused changes in the aspect of the discharges. Namely, an increase in strength brought more spikes to appear in the negative phase. With very low frequency it resulted in some spikes appearing in the positive phase, too. If the stimulus frequency is high, and if the current is sufficiently strong, then the one-for-one appearance of the spikes continued to follow much higher frequency, than when it is weak."

For that reason it was considered justified to limit this review en\u00ad tirely to thermal receptors. The temperature movements in the skin have been subject to theoretical as well as experimental investigations by Hensel (2, 3), who has developed effective methods for recording the intracutaneous temperature gradient in stationary conditions as well as a precision-flow-ca lorimeter for measuring the steady heat flow given off from small skin areas, the mean error of the method being only \u00b1 0.0001 cal. cm.2 sec.-1 The new \"Stromungskalorime ter\" constructed by Hensel (4) can be used clinically also for the determination of the blood flow through the skin. For details, see Hensel's monograph \"Physiologie der Thermoreception\" in Ergebnisse der Physiologie (5). The depths of cold receptors in the tongue of the cat have been recorded in aIi objective way by Hensel, Strom, and Zotterman (6). This method is based on the recording of the spike potential of specific cold fibres in the lingual nerve set up by applying rapid cold jumps to the tongue and by simul\u00ad taneous recording of the temperature changes. The depth of the cold recep\u00ad tors was calculated from determinations of (a) the threshold, (b) the tempera\u00ad ture change of the thermode, (c) the latency of the specific cold spikes, (d) the thermal diffusion coefficient of the tongue. From a great number of meas\u00ad urements on the tongue of the cat, a mean value of 0.18 mm. \u00b10.04 was ob\u00ad tained. The cold receptors are thus situated closely beneath the epithelium. At this depth an abundance of afferent nerve endings of various configura\u00ad tions have been described by histologists (ef. Sanders (7)). The investigations of the receptive field for thermoceptors has often led to much debate. The question is, as Jenkins (8) formulates it, whether it should be compared with an unsensitive surface with spread circumscript sensitive spots or rather as a continuum with peaks, valleys, and plateaus. The peaks should then cor\u00ad respond to the spots according to the classical view. Hensel (5) maintains 1 The survey of the literature pertaining to this review was concluded in June,"

It is the characteristic position an animal assumes when at rest and from which all active movements originate. Such a normal position is generally not defined by the organism's physical centre of gravity, but is actively achieved and maintained. An orientation of this type is possible only if receptors are available which are sensitive to the magnitude and relative direction of gravitational force. It is the purpose of this study to investigate such receptors in the invertebrate statocyst by recording action potentials from the primary afferent neurones. The organ classically associated with geo-Qrientation is the statocyst, a term which has been applied to the vertebrate utriculus and sacculus as well as to the invertebrate equilibrium organ (Fraenkel & Gunn, 1940; von Buddenbrock, 1952). For the purpose of clarity, the vertebrate utriculus and sacculus will be referred to as otolith organs, following the usage of Lowenstein (1950), and the analogous invertebrate structure as a statocyst. The statocyst can be described as an ectodermal sac, fluid-filled and lined by hairs which are in contact with a relatively dense mass, the statolith. Such structures occur in all major metazoan phyla (Plate, 1924; Kolmer, 1926) and their appearance in the Hydromedusae, which are still at a tissue level of organization, qualify them in a real sense as the first organ to appear in the animal kingdom. The most intensive investigation of statocysts, both from a morphological and physiological standpoint, has occurred in the decapod crustacea. Within this group, including lobsters, shrimps and crabs, a statocyst occurs in the basal segment of each antennule, thereby being readily accessible to experimental manipulation with a minimum of trauma to the animal.

Two series of experiments were necessary, the first to determine the amount of energy in each ray, the second to observe the corresponding visual effect. The energy was determined as heat by the use of the bolometer, the heat dispersed by a prism being very nearly proportionate to the energy."

Two experiments are reported which test some predictions of the theory for the case of the signal-known-exactly. These experiments demonstrate that the human observer tends toward optimum behavior, where optimum behavior is defined as that behavior which maximizes the expected gain from the decision. Their results show the proportion of correct detections to be dependent upon the proportion of false alarms; they indicate that neural activity is a power function of signal intensity. The data also demand a re-evaluation of the threshhold concept. Predictions are made for the data obtained using two different methods of response, forced-choice end yes-no, and the internal consistency of the theory is demonstrated. The predictions of the theory are compared with contrasting predictions of conventional sensory theory; the data are also related to conventional theory."
