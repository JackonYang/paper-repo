A Markov process on a torus In this paper we construct a stationary process on the square lattice formed by all the pairs of positive and negative integers, in which the random variables, Xmn,, say, are identically normally distributed and satisfy a Markovian property. We do this by first constructing a similar such process on a lattice torus and letting the size of the latter tend to infinity."

My contribution to a conference at Sheffield in 1973 aimed, at least in part, to supply such a review and forms the basis of this monograph; but in these prefatory remarks I must still make clear what I decided to discuss, and what I have omitted. Broadly speaking, the coverage is that included in seminars and lectures I have given on this theme since 1969. We may divide problems of spatial pattern (in contrast with complete random chaos) into (i) detecting departures from randomness, Oi) analysing such departures when detected, for example, in relation to some stochastic model and (iii) special problems which require separate consideration; for example, sophisticated problems of pattern recognition in specific fields, such as the computer reading of handwriting or recognition of chromosomes."

                "text": "The partition function of a two-dimensional \"ferromagnetic\" with scalar \"spins\" (Ising model) is computed rigorously for the case of vanishing field. The eigenwert problem involved in the corresponding computation for a long strip crystal of finite width ($n$ atoms), joined straight to itself around a cylinder, is solved by direct product decomposition; in the special case $n=\\ensuremath{\\infty}$ an integral replaces a sum. The choice of different interaction energies ($\\ifmmode\\pm\\else\\textpm\\fi{}J,\\ifmmode\\pm\\else\\textpm\\fi{}{J}^{\\ensuremath{'}}$) in the (0 1) and (1 0) directions does not complicate the problem. The two-way infinite crystal has an order-disorder transition at a temperature $T={T}_{c}$ given by the condition $sinh(\\frac{2J}{k{T}_{c}}) sinh(\\frac{2{J}^{\\ensuremath{'}}}{k{T}_{c}})=1.$ The energy is a continuous function of $T$; but the specific heat becomes infinite as $\\ensuremath{-}log |T\\ensuremath{-}{T}_{c}|$. For strips of finite width, the maximum of the specific heat increases linearly with $log n$. The order-converting dual transformation invented by Kramers and Wannier effects a simple automorphism of the basis of the quaternion algebra which is natural to the problem in hand. In addition to the thermodynamic properties of the massive crystal, the free energy of a (0 1) boundary between areas of opposite order is computed; on this basis the mean ordered length of a strip crystal is ${(\\mathrm{exp} (\\frac{2J}{\\mathrm{kT}}) tanh(\\frac{2{J}^{\\ensuremath{'}}}{\\mathrm{kT}}))}^{n}.$"

                "text": "Sliding block codes are an intriguing alternative to the block codes used in the development of classical information theory. The fundamental analytical problem associated with the use of a sliding block code (SBC) for source encoding with respect to a fidelity criterion is that of determining the entropy of the coder output. Several methods of calculating and of bounding the output entropy of an SBC are presented. The local and global behaviors of a well-designed SBC also are discussed. The so-called \"101-coder,\" which eliminates all the isolated zeros from a binary input, plays a central role. It not only provides a specific example for application of the techniques developed for calculating and bounding the output entropy, but also serves as a medium for obtaining indirect insight into the problem of characterizing a good SBC. An easily implementable SBC subclass is introduced in which the outputs can be calculated by simple logic circuitry. The study of this subclass is shown to be closely linked with the theory of algebraic group codes."
