However, this introduces a challenging learning scenario where the relation expressed by a pair of entities found in a sentence is unknown. For example, a sentence containing Balzac and France may express BornIn or Died, an unknown relation, or no relation at all. Because of this, traditional supervised learning, which assumes that each example is explicitly mapped to a label, is not appropriate. We propose a novel approach to multi-instance multi-label learning for RE, which jointly models all the instances of a pair of entities in text and all their labels using a graphical model with latent variables. Our model performs competitively on two difficult domains."

This paper formulates image categorization as a multi-label classification problem using recent advances in matrix completion. Under this setting, classification of testing data is posed as a problem of completing unknown label entries on a data matrix that concatenates training and testing features with training labels. We propose two convex algorithms for matrix completion based on a Rank Minimization criterion specifically tailored to visual data, and prove its convergence properties. A major advantage of our approach w.r.t. standard discriminative classification methods for image categorization is its robustness to outliers, background noise and partial occlusions both in the feature and label space. Experimental validation on several datasets shows how our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, while effectively capturing semantic concepts of classes."

Machine learning approaches to this task require either manual annotation or, in the case of distant supervision, existing structured sources of the same schema. The need for existing datasets can be avoided by using a universal schema: the union of all involved schemas (surface form predicates as in OpenIE, and relations in the schemas of preexisting databases). This schema has an almost unlimited set of relations (due to surface forms), and supports integration with existing structured data (through the relation types of existing databases). To populate a database of such schema we present matrix factorization models that learn latent feature vectors for entity tuples and relations. We show that such latent models achieve substantially higher accuracy than a traditional classification approach. More importantly, by operating simultaneously on relations observed in text and in pre-existing structured DBs such as Freebase, we are able to reason about unstructured and structured data in mutually-supporting ways. By doing so our approach outperforms stateof- the-Art distant supervision."

By assuming the underlying matrix has a low rank, our formulation is able to handle three problems simultaneously: i) multi-label learning, where each item has more than one label, ii) transduction, where most of these labels are unspecified, and iii) missing data, where a large number of features are missing. We obtained satisfactory results on several real-world tasks, suggesting that the low rank assumption may not be as restrictive as it seems. Our method allows for different loss functions to apply on the feature and label entries of the matrix. The resulting nuclear norm minimization problem is solved with a modified fixed-point continuation method that is guaranteed to find the global optimum."

However, previous work has failed to address the problem of false negative training examples mislabeled due to the incompleteness of knowledge bases. To tackle this problem, we propose a simple yet novel framework that combines a passage retrieval model using coarse features into a state-of-the-art relation extractor using multi-instance learning with fine features. We adapt the information retrieval technique of pseudorelevance feedback to expand knowledge bases, assuming entity pairs in top-ranked passages are more likely to express a relation. Our proposed technique significantly improves the quality of distantly supervised relation extraction, boosting recall from 47.7% to 61.2% with a consistently high level of precision of around 93% in the experiments."

We investigate an alternative paradigm that does not require labeled corpora, avoiding the domain dependence of ACE-style algorithms, and allowing the use of corpora of any size. Our experiments use Freebase, a large semantic database of several thousand relations, to provide distant supervision. For each pair of entities that appears in some Freebase relation, we find all sentences containing those entities in a large unlabeled corpus and extract textual features to train a relation classifier. Our algorithm combines the advantages of supervised IE (combining 400,000 noisy pattern features in a probabilistic classifier) and unsupervised IE (extracting large numbers of relations from large corpora of any domain). Our model is able to extract 10,000 instances of 102 relations at a precision of 67.6%. We also analyze feature performance, showing that syntactic parse features are particularly helpful for relations that are ambiguous or lexically distant in their expression."

When a sentence and a knowledge base refer to the same entity pair, this approach heuristically labels the sentence with the corresponding relation in the knowledge base. However, this heuristic can fail with the result that some sentences are labeled wrongly. This noisy labeled data causes poor extraction performance. In this paper, we propose a method to reduce the number of wrong labels. We present a novel generative model that directly models the heuristic labeling process of distant supervision. The model predicts whether assigned labels are correct or wrong via its hidden variables. Our experimental results show that this model detected wrong labels with higher performance than baseline methods. In the experiment, we also found that our wrong label reduction boosted the performance of relation extraction."

Crucially, these approaches are trained based on the assumption that each sentence which mentions the two related entities is an expression of the given relation. Here we argue that this leads to noisy patterns that hurt precision, in particular if the knowledge base is not directly related to the text we are working with. We present a novel approach to distant supervision that can alleviate this problem based on the following two ideas: First, we use a factor graph to explicitly model the decision whether two entities are related, and the decision whether this relation is mentioned in a given sentence; second, we apply constraint-driven semi-supervision to train this model without any knowledge about which sentences express the relations in our training KB. We apply our approach to extract relations from the New York Times corpus and use Freebase as knowledge base. When compared to a state-of-the-art approach for relation extraction under distant supervision, we achieve 31% error reduction."

Recently, researchers have developed multi-instance learning algorithms to combat the noisy training data that can come from heuristic labeling, but their models assume relations are disjoint --- for example they cannot extract the pair Founded(Jobs, Apple) and CEO-of(Jobs, Apple). \n \nThis paper presents a novel approach for multi-instance learning with overlapping relations that combines a sentence-level extraction model with a simple, corpus-level component for aggregating the individual facts. We apply our model to learn extractors for NY Times text using weak supervision from Free-base. Experiments show that the approach runs quickly and yields surprising gains in accuracy, at both the aggregate and sentence level."

Therefore the heuristic for generating negative examples has a seriousflaw. Building on a state-of-the-art distantly-supervised extraction algorithm, we proposed an algorithm that learns from only positive and unlabeled labels at the pair-of-entity level.

However, the accuracy is still not satisfying. In this paper, we point out and analyze some critical factors in DS which have great impact on accuracy, including valid entity type detection, negative training examples construction and ensembles. We propose an approach to handle these factors. By experimenting on Wikipedia articles to extract the facts in Freebase (the top 92 relations), we show the impact of these three factors on the accuracy of DS and the remarkable improvement led by the proposed approach."

MMMF can be formulated as a semi-definite programming (SDP) and learned using standard SDP solvers. However, current SDP solvers can only handle MMMF problems on matrices of dimensionality up to a few hundred. Here, we investigate a direct gradient-based optimization method for MMMF and demonstrate it on large collaborative prediction problems. We compare against results obtained by Marlin (2004) and find that MMMF substantially outperforms all nine methods he tested."

This paper investigates the incorporation of diverse lexical, syntactic and semantic knowledge in feature-based relation extraction using SVM. Our study illustrates that the base phrase chunking information is very effective for relation extraction and contributes to most of the performance improvement from syntactic aspect while additional information from full parsing gives limited further enhancement. This suggests that most of useful information in full parse trees for relation extraction is shallow and can be captured by chunking. We also demonstrate how semantic information such as WordNet and Name List, can be used in feature-based relation extraction to further improve the performance. Evaluation on the ACE corpus shows that effective incorporation of diverse features enables our system outperform previously best-reported systems on the 24 ACE relation subtypes and significantly outperforms tree kernel-based systems by over 20 in F-measure on the 5 ACE relation types."

Suppose that we observe m entries selected uniformly at random from a matrix M. Can we complete the matrix and recover the entries that we have not seen?We show that one can perfectly recover most low-rank matrices from what appears to be an incomplete set of entries. We prove that if the number m of sampled entries obeys $$m\\ge C\\,n^{1.2}r\\log n$$ for some positive numerical constant C, then with very high probability, most n\u00d7n matrices of rank r can be perfectly recovered by solving a simple convex optimization program. This program finds the matrix with minimum nuclear norm that fits the data. The condition above assumes that the rank is not too large. However, if one replaces the 1.2 exponent with 1.25, then the result holds for all values of the rank. Similar results hold for arbitrary rectangular matrices as well. Our results are connected with the recent literature on compressed sensing, and show that objects other than signals and images can be perfectly reconstructed from very limited information."

These systems often rely on Collaborating Filtering (CF), where past transactions are analyzed in order to establish connections between users and products. The two more successful approaches to CF are latent factor models, which directly profile both users and products, and neighborhood models, which analyze similarities between products or users. In this work we introduce some innovations to both approaches. The factor and neighborhood models can now be smoothly merged, thereby building a more accurate combined model. Further accuracy improvements are achieved by extending the models to exploit both explicit and implicit feedback by the users. The methods are tested on the Netflix data. Results are better than those previously published on that dataset. In addition, we suggest a new evaluation metric, which highlights the differences among methods, based on their performance at a top-K recommendation task."

Motivated by the problem of automatically constructing and extending such taxonomies, in this paper we present a new algorithm for automatically learning hypernym (is-a) relations from text. Our method generalizes earlier work that had relied on using small numbers of hand-crafted regular expression patterns to identify hypernym pairs. Using \"dependency path\" features extracted from parse trees, we introduce a general-purpose formalization and generalization of these patterns. Given a training set of text containing known hypernym pairs, our algorithm automatically extracts useful dependency paths and applies them to new corpora to identify novel pairs. On our evaluation task (determining whether two nouns in a news article participate in a hypernym relationship), our automatically extracted database of hypernyms attains both higher precision and higher recall than WordNet."

Recently, Ma, Goldfarb and Chen proposed a fixed-point continuation algorithm for solving the nuclear norm minimization problem (Math. Program., doi:10.1007/s10107-009-0306-5, 2009). By incorporating an approximate singular value decomposition technique in this algorithm, the solution to the matrix rank minimization problem is usually obtained. In this paper, we study the convergence/recoverability properties of the fixed-point continuation algorithm and its variants for matrix rank minimization. Heuristics for determining the rank of the matrix when its true rank is not known are also proposed. Some of these algorithms are closely related to greedy algorithms in compressed sensing. Numerical results for these algorithms for solving affinely constrained matrix rank minimization problems are reported."

We have begun a research effort aimed at automatically mapping information from text sources into structured representations, such as knowledge bases. Our approach to this task is to use machine-learning methods to induce routines for extracting facts from text. We describe two learning methods that we have applied to this task--a statistical text classification method, and a relational learning method--and our initial experiments in learning such information-extraction routines. We also present an approach to decreasing the cost of learning information-extraction routines by learning from \"weakly\" labeled training data."

The tightest convex relaxation of this problem is the linearly constrained nuclear norm minimization. Although the latter can be cast as a semidefinite programming problem, such an approach is computationally expensive to solve when the matrices are large. In this paper, we propose fixed point and Bregman iterative algorithms for solving the nuclear norm minimization problem and prove convergence of the first of these algorithms. By using a homotopy approach together with an approximate singular value decomposition procedure, we get a very fast, robust and powerful algorithm, which we call FPCA (Fixed Point Continuation with Approximate SVD), that can solve very large matrix rank minimization problems (the code can be downloaded from http://www.columbia.edu/~sm2756/FPCA.htm for non-commercial use). Our numerical results on randomly generated and real matrix completion problems demonstrate that this algorithm is much faster and provides much better recoverability than semidefinite programming solvers such as SDPT3. For example, our algorithm can recover 1000 \u00d7 1000 matrices of rank 50 with a relative error of 10\u22125 in about 3\u00a0min by sampling only 20% of the elements. We know of no other method that achieves as good recoverability. Numerical experiments on online recommendation, DNA microarray data set and image inpainting problems demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms."

Beyond the discussion of the whys and wherefores of the logistic function, I also hope to illuminate the general distinction between the \\generative/causal/class-conditional\" and the \\discriminative/diagnostic/ predictive\" directions for the modeling of data. Crudely put, the belief network community has tended to focus on the former while the neural network community has tended to focus on the latter (although there are numerous papers in both communities going against their respective grains). It is the author's view that these two directions are two sides of the same coin, a corollary of which is that the two network-based communities are in closer contact than one might otherwise think. To illustrate some of the issues involved, I discuss the simplest nonlinear neural network|a logistic function of a linear combination of the input variables (also known in statistics as a logistic regression). The logistic function has had a lengthy history in classical statistics and in neural networks. In statistics it plays a leading role in the methodology of logistic regression, where it makes an important contribution to the literature on classi cation. The logistic function has also appeared in many guises in neural network research. In early work, in which continuous time formalisms tended to dominate, it was justi ed via its being the solution to a particular di erential equation. In later work, with the emphasis on discrete time, it was generally used more heuristically as one of the many possible smooth, monotonic \\squashing\" functions that map real values into a bounded interval. More recently, however, with the increasing focus on learning, the probabilistic properties of the logistic function have begun to"

The heuristic is to replace the (nonconvex) rank objective with the sum of the singular values of the matrix, which is the dual of the spectral norm. We show that this problem can be reduced to a semidefinite program, hence efficiently solved. To motivate the heuristic, we, show that the dual spectral norm is the convex envelope of the rank on the set of matrices with norm less than one. We demonstrate the method on the problem of minimum-order system approximation."

The scheme first transforms A to a bidiagonal matrix J, then diagonalizes J. The scheme described here is complicated but does not suffer from the computational difficulties which occasionally afflict some previously known methods. Some applications are mentioned, in particular the use of the pseudo-inverse $A^I = V\\Sigma ^I U^* $ to solve least squares problems in a way which dampens spurious oscillation and cancellation."
