The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge."

In particular, we address the problem of the detection of visual contours in noise/clutter by optimizing a global criterion which combines local intensity and geometry information. We analyze the convergence rates of A* search algorithms using results from information theory to bound the probability of rare events within the Bayesian ensemble. This analysis determines characteristics of the domain, which we call order parameters, that determine the convergence rates. In particular, we present a specific admissible A* algorithm with pruning which converges, with high probability, with expected time O(N) in the size of the problem. In addition, we briefly summarize extensions of this work which address fundamental limits of target contour detectability (i.e. algorithm independent results) and the use of non-admissible heuristics."

This principle consists of two parts. The first is the maximum entropy principle for feature binding (or fusion): for a given set of observed feature statistics, a distribution can be built to bind these feature statistics together by maximizing the entropy over all distributions that reproduce them. The second part is the minimum entropy principle for feature selection: among all plausible sets of feature statistics, we choose the set whose maximum entropy distribution has the minimum entropy. Computational and inferential issues in both parts are addressed; in particular, a feature pursuit procedure is proposed for approximately selecting the optimal set of features. The minimax entropy principle is then corrected by considering the sample variation in the observed feature statistics, and an information criterion for feature pursuit is derived. The minimax entropy principle is applied to texture modeling, where a novel Markov random field (MRF) model, called FRAME (filter, random field, and minimax entropy), is derived, and encouraging results are obtained in experiments on a variety of texture images. The relationship between our theory and the mechanisms of neural computation is also discussed."

The chapters in this volume cover the three main paradigms for evaluating computer vision algorithms. The paradigms are: (1) evaluations that are independently administered, (2) evaluation of a set of algorithms by one research group, and (3) evaluation methods that feature ground truthing procedures as a major component."

Our approach is related to recent work in active vision on \"where to look next\" and motivated by the \"divide-and-conquer\" strategy of parlour games. We choose \"tests\" (matched filters for short road segments) one at a time in order to remove as much uncertainty as possible about the \"true hypothesis\" (road position) given the results of the previous tests. The tests are chosen online based on a statistical model for the joint distribution of tests and hypotheses. The problem of minimizing uncertainty (measured by entropy) is formulated in simple and explicit analytical terms. At each iteration new image data are examined and a new entropy minimization problem is solved (exactly), resulting in a new image location to inspect, and so forth. We report experiments using panchromatic SPOT satellite imagery with a ground resolution of ten meters."

We studied the statistics of natural images including the scale invariant properties, then generic prior models were learned to duplicate the observed statistics, based on minimax entropy theory. The resulting Gibbs distributions have potentials of the form U(I; /spl Lambda/, S)=/spl Sigma//sub /spl alpha/=1//sup k//spl Sigma//sub x,y//spl lambda//sup (/spl alpha/)/((F/sup (/spl alpha/)/*I)(x,y)) with S={F/sup (1)/, F/sup (2)/,...,F/sup (K)/} being a set of filters and /spl Lambda/={/spl lambda//sup (1)/(),/spl lambda//sup (2)/(),...,/spl lambda//sup (K)/()} the potential functions. The learned Gibbs distributions confirm and improve the form of existing prior models such as line-process, but, in contrast to all previous models, inverted potentials were found to be necessary. We find that the partial differential equations given by gradient descent on U(I; /spl Lambda/, S) are essentially reaction-diffusion equations, where the usual energy terms produce anisotropic diffusion, while the inverted energy terms produce reaction associated with pattern formation, enhancing preferred image features. We illustrate how these models can be used for texture pattern rendering, denoising, image enhancement, and clutter removal by careful choice of both prior and data models of this type, incorporating the appropriate features."

Calciclastic submarine fans are consequently rarely described and are poorly understood. Subsequently, very little is known especially in mud-dominated calciclastic submarine fan systems. Presented in this study are a sedimentological core and petrographic characterisation of samples from eleven boreholes from the Lower Carboniferous of Bowland Basin (Northwest England) that reveals a >250 m thick calciturbidite complex deposited in a calciclastic submarine fan setting. Seven facies are recognised from core and thin section characterisation and are grouped into three carbonate turbidite sequences. They include: 1) Calciturbidites, comprising mostly of highto low-density, wavy-laminated bioclast-rich facies; 2) low-density densite mudstones which are characterised by planar laminated and unlaminated muddominated facies; and 3) Calcidebrites which are muddy or hyper-concentrated debrisflow deposits occurring as poorly-sorted, chaotic, mud-supported floatstones.
