Dr Jackendoff has attempted to take a broader view of semantics, studying the important contribution it makes to the syntactic patterns of English.The research is carried out in the framework of an interpretive theory, that is, a theory of grammar in which syntactic structures are given interpretations by an autonomous syntactic component. The book investigates a wide variety of semantic rules, stating them in considerable detail and extensively treating their consequences for the syntactic component of the grammar. In particular, it is shown that the hypothesis that transformations do not change meaning must be abandoned; but equally stringent restrictions on transformations are formulated within the interpretive theory.Among the areas of grammar discussed are the well-known problems of case relations, pronominalization, negation, and quantifiers. In addition, the author presents semantic analyses of such neglected areas as adverbs and intonation contours; he also proposes radically new approaches to the so-called Crossover Principle, the control problem for complement subjects, parentheticals, and the interpretation of nonspecific noun phrases."

In particular, I will look at the phenomenon of type coercion, and how this behavior can be accounted for by the grammar in a systematic way. I suggest that the ambiguity exhibited by adjectives, aspectual verbs, experiencer verbs, and many causatives is the result of type coercion operations. That is, every lexical item exhibits some degree of ambiguity, what I call logical polysemy. This behavior is captured by enriching the lexical semantic representation for lexical items while also allowing a word\u2019s semantic type to shift or be coerced in particular contexts. By allowing both verbs and nouns to shift in type, we can \u201cspread the semantic load\u201d in the lexicon more evenly, while still capturing the ways in which words can extend their meanings, i.e. the creative use of words."

We suggest that the discrepancies arise because of an inadequate representation of the native speaker\u2019s knowledge of the English verb system. Drawing on linguistic research into the verbal classification scheme of English, we construct a \u2018dictionary-neutral\u2019 summary of the semantic-syntactic relationships pertinent to the verb bake, designed to enable the lexicographer to make principled decisions about the content and presentation for a specific dictionary.

This paper presents another such proposal, one that differs from previous proposals mainly in that it represents an attempt to be highly restrictive, perhaps erring in that direction. By argument structure of a lexical item I mean simply a labelled listing of the arguments that a lexical item can have. I will adopt the labelling proposed by Gruber (1976) (Actor, Theme, Goal, Source), though the actual labels themselves are not important. These are called thematic relations. Now suppose that a lexical item has an argument structure, and we apply some morphological rule to that lexical item to derive a new lexical item, with a new argument structure. What we want to characterize in this paper is the function that will relate the old argument structure to the new argument structure. One way to do this would be to dive right in and write a notation for writing argument structure transformations in. This is essentially what past proposals have done. What I intend to do instead is to specify two functions (\"internalize X\" and \"externalize X\"), each parameterized by the thematic relations. Since there are finitely many thematic relations, there are finitely many functions, and the claim is that these exhaust the possibilities. Before these functions can be specified, there are a number of topics that must be discussed which are independent of these functions. For example, we must have a theory of exactly how many argument types (thematic relations) there are. Furthermore, we must determine whether there is any further structure to the argument structure of a verb than"

Of central importance in this effort is the axiomatization of what might be called \"commonsense metaphysics\". This includes a number of areas that figure in virtually every domain of discourse, such as scalar notions, granularity, time, space, material, physical objects, causality, functionality, force, and shape. Our approach to lexical semantics is then to construct core theories of each of these areas, and then to define, or at least characterize, a large number of lexical items in terms provided by the core theories. In the TACITUS system, processes for solving pragmatics problems posed by a text will use the knowledge base consisting of these theories in conjunction with the logical forms of the sentences in the text to produce an interpretation. In this paper we do not stress these interpretation processes; this is another, important aspect of the TACITUS project, and it will be described in subsequent papers."

The overall aim of the project is to design lexical entries, primarily for predicators, which will express the linguistic knowledge which a speaker of a given languag~ possesses in relation to lexical items. Our more limited purpose in this paper is to discuss certain alternations in the syntax of English verbs, specifically, alternations in transitivity which are not reflected by corresponding alternations in morphological form. The aim, in general, is to determine the minimum which must be said in a lexical entry in order to account for this particular aspect of English lexical knowledge. And our methodological approach is one which seeks, where possible, to rely solely upon principles which have been shown to be independently necessary within a well articulated general theory of grammar, in this instance, the theory developed in ~homsky's Lectures on Government and Binding (1981) and in a variety of publications since. The ideas which we employ in this discussion are, for the most part, ideas which are around, in the literature and in unpublished papers and discussions, and we wish to apologize in advance for the almost inevitable occasions in which we will fail properly to attribute them to their true originators. In the first section of the paper, a certain amount of descriptive apparatus is set up to account for the observed syntactic behavior of selected English verb types. In the second and third sections, we setabout dismantling this apparatus, in so far as we can, in an effort to arrive at an understanding of thefundamental grammatical elements involved. This is a preliminary -version of our work, and assumptions \u00b7made early in the paper will be contradicted, intentionally, in later parts. Our terminological usage in this preliminary version is also somewhat inconsistent. Thus, for example, we first use the terms ergative and unaccusative interchangeably. Later,. however, we will 'distinguish \"ergatives\" (like break, operz etc.) which have transitive and intransitive uses, from \"unaccusatives', (like appear, arrive, arise, etc.), which have only the intransitive use but also allow There-Insertion..There are other rough spots in the exposition which we will attempt to eliminate in later versions."

It offers a methodology which makes it possible to demonstrate, on an empirical basis, that syntax is neither \u201cautonomous\u201d nor \u201carbitrary\u201d, but that it follows from \u201csemantics\u201d. It is shown that every grammatical construction encodes a certain semantic structure, which can be revealed and rigorously stated, so that the meanings encoded in grammar can be compared in a precise and illuminating way, within one language and across language boundaries. The author develops a semantic metalanguage based on lexical universals or near-universals (and, ultimately, on a system of universal semantic primitives), and shows that the same semantic metalanguage can be used for explicating lexical, grammatical and pragmatic aspects of language and thus offers a method for an integrated linguistic description based on semantic foundations. Analyzing data from a number of different languages (including English, Russian and Japanese) the author explores the notion of ethnosyntax and, via semantics, links syntax and morphology with culture. She attemps to demonstrate that the use of a semantic metalanguage based on lexical universals makes it possible to rephrase the Humboldt-Sapir-Whorf hypothesis in such a way that it can be tested and treated as a program for empirical research."

HPSG's grammar contains fewer than twenty (very general) rules; its predecessor required over 350 to achieve roughly the same coverage. This simplification of the grammar is made possible by an enrichment of the structure and content of lexical entries, using both inheritance mechanisms and lexical rules to represent the linguistic information in a general and efficient form. We will argue that our mechanisms for structure-sharing not only provide the ability to express important linguistic generalization about the lexicon, but also make possible an efficient, readily modifiable implementation that we find quite adequate for continuing development of a large natural language system."

We begin by showing how these assumptions come to grief over the prob\u00ad lems posed by the phenomenon of polysemy, when one word, like chicken, is used to refer at one time to a kind of bird and at another to a kind of meat. It is argued, first that the inclusion of multiple lexical entries leads to undesirable complications in the syntax, and second that pragmatic schemata that generate multiple uses must be inde\u00ad pendently available, since the same phenomena appear in ostensive reference. An account of \"deferred ostension\" is presented, in which it is shown why you can point at some things to identify others; this account is then extended to the multiple uses of \"descriptive terms.\" We proceed to argue that with descriptions, there is no way to tell which of the uses of a word is specified by the rules of language, either in practice or in principle; the semantics/pragmatics distinction cannot be drawn. In that case, we argue, the idealization to the knowledge of the ideal speaker-listener in a perfectly homogeneous speech-community is considerably more pernicious for semantics than for syntax or phonology, as we must pre\u00ad sume as well a community in which extralinguistic beliefs and practices are uniform. We conclude that it is more reasonable to describe the speaker's knowledge of wordmeanings as part of his knowledge of the (heterogeneous) collective beliefs of the community, which we can idealize as his \"system of normal beliefs,\" borrowing our model from game theory. Against this idealization, we show, it is possible to explain a number of disparate linguistic phenom\u00ad ena, such as speaker judgments that some word uses are \"acceptable,\" the phenomena associated with \"partial moti\u00ad vation,\" metaphorical word-uses, and change in meaning.

The strategies that are most actively being explored can perhaps be classified in two groups. The first group of proposals tries to come up with a theory of logical space capable of weighting information content in subtle ways. Data semantics, for example, (Veltman (1983), Landman (1986)) and situation semantics (Barwise and Perry 1983) fall within this group. The second group of proposals centers around the idea that at some level propositional content must be represented in terms of sentence-like structures, as Frege and Russell suggested. The structured meaning approach (a variant of Carnap\u2019s intensional isomorphism approach), developed in Cresswell (1985) and related work falls in this second group."

In support of this we give a fragment of an axiomatization for word-sense disambiguation, nounphrase (and verb) reference, and case disambiguation. We describe an inference engine (Frail3) which actually takes this axiomatization and uses it to drive the semantic interpretation process. We claim three benefits from this scheme. First, the interface between semantic interpretation and pragmatics has always been problematic, since all of the above tasks in general require pragmatic inference. Now the interface is trival, since both semantic interpretation and pragmatics use the same vocabulary and inference engine. The second benefit, related to the first, is that semantic guidance of syntax is a side effect of the interpretation. The third benefit is the elegance of the semantic interpretation theory. A few simple rules capture a remarkable diversity of semantic phenomena."

                "text": "We use words to talk about the world. Therefore, to understand what words mean, we must have a prior explication of how we view the world. In a sense, efforts in the past to decompose words into semantic primitives were attempts to link word meaning to a theory of the world, where the set of semantic primitives constituted the theory of the world. With the advent of naive physics and research programs to formalize commonsense knowledge in a number of areas in predicate calculus or some other formal language, we now have at our disposal means for building much richer theories of varlous aspects of the world, and consequently, we are in a much better position to address the problems of le~cal semantics. In the TACITUS project for using commonsense.knowledge in the understanding of texts about mechanical devices and their failures, we have been developing various commonsense theories that are needed to mediate between the way we talk about the behavior of such devices and causal models of their operation (Hobbs et M., 1986). The theories cover a number of areas that figure in virtually every domain of discourse, such as scalar notions, granularity, structured systems, time, space, material, physical objects, causality, functionality, force, and shape. Our approach has been to construct core t h e o r i e s of each of these areas. These core theories may use English words as their predicates, but the principal criterion for adequacy of the core theory is elegance, whatever that is, and this can usually be achieved better using predicates that are not lexically realized. It is easier to achieve elegance if one does not have to be held responsible to linguistic evidence. Predicates that are lexically realized are then pushed to the periphery of the theory. A large number of lexical items can be defined, or at least characterized, in terms provided by the core theories. The hypothesis is that once these core theories have been formulated in the right way, it will be straightforward to explicate the meanings of a great many words. The phrase \"in the right way\" is key in this strategy. The world is"

This long-awaited book contains both detailed specifications of the theory and extensive illustrations of its power to describe large parts of English grammar. Experts who wish to evaluate the theory and students learning GPSP for the first time will find this book an invaluable guide.The initial chapters lay out the theoretical machinery of GPSP in a readily intelligible way. Combining informal discussion with precise formalization, the authors describe all major aspects of their grammatical system, including a complete theory of syntactic features, phrase structure rules, meta rules, and feature instantiation principles. The book then shows just what a GPSP analysis of English syntax can accomplish. Topics include the internal structure of phrases, unbounded dependency constructions of many varieties, and coordinate conjunction a construction long considered the sticking point for phrase structure approaches to syntax.The book concludes with a well developed proposal for a model theoretic semantic system to go along with GPSP syntax. Throughout, the authors maintain the highest standards of explicitness and rigor in developing and assessing their grammatical system. Their aim is to provide the best possible test of the hypothesis that syntactic description can be accomplished in a single-level system. And more generally, it is their intention to formulate a grammatical framework in which linguistic universals follow directly from the form of the system and therefore require no explicit statement. Their book sets new methodological standards for work in generative grammar while presenting a grammatical system of extraordinary scope.\""

The principal intended area of application is the representation of lexical entries for natural language processing, and we use examples from this domain throughout. In this paper we present the syntax and inference mechanisms for the language. The goal of the DATR enterprise is the design of a simple language that (i) has the necessary expressive power to encode the lexical entries presupposed by contemporary work in the unification grammar tradition, (ii) can express all the evident generalizations about such entries, (iii) has an explicit theory of inference, (iv) is computationally tractable, and (v) has an explicit declarative semantics. The present paper is primarily concerned with (iii), though the examples used may hint at our strategy in respect of (i) and (ii)."

Until recently, thematic roles were invoked only in research that treated semantics non-formally (i.e. not model-theoretically). The level of semantic rigor behind these notions in this literature is suggested by the characterizations in (1) of some of the roles from Andrews (1985) and Jackendoff (1985), which are very typical of the way roles are introduced in this literature."

First, it is narrow linguistically. It fails to take into account the phenomenon of verb aspect. The trichotomy is not one of verbs as lexical types but of predications. Second, the trichotomy is narrow ontologically. It is a specification in the context of human agency of the more fundamental, topic-neutral trichotomy, event-process-state.The central component in this ontological trichotomy, event, can be sharply differentiated from its two flanking components by adapting a suggestion by Geoffrey N. Leech and others that the contrast between perfective and imperfective aspect in verbs corresponds to the count/mass distinction in the domain of nouns. With the help of two distinctions, of \u201ccardinal count\u201d adverbials versus frequency adverbials, and of occurrence versus associated occasion, two interrelated criteria for event predication are developed. Accordingly, \u201cMary capsized the boat\u201d is an event predication because (a) it is equivalent to \u201cThere was at least one capsizing of the boat by Mary,\u201d or (b) because it admits cardinal count adverbials, e.g., \u201cat least once,\u201d \u201ctwice,\u201d \u201cthree times.\u201d Ontologically speaking, events are defined as those occurrences that are inherently countable."

This paperl does not attempt to present a semantic theory of a natural language, but rather to characterize the form of such a theory. A semantic theory of a natural language is part of a linguistic description of that language. Our problem, on the other hand, is part of the general theory of language, fully on a par with the problem of characterizing the structure of grammars of natural languages. A characterization of the abstract form of a semantic theory is given by a metatheory which answers such questions as these: What is the domain of a semantic theory? What are the descriptive and explanatory goals of a semantic theory? What mechanisms are employed in pursuit of these goals? What are the empirical and methodological constraints upon a semantic theory? The present paper approaches the problem of characterizing the form of semantic theories by describing the structure of a semantic theory of English. There can be little doubt but that the results achieved will apply directly to semantic theories of languages closely related to English. The question of their applicability to semantic theories of more distant languages will be left for subsequent investigations to explore. Nevertheless, the present investigation will provide results that can be applied to semantic theories of languages unrelated to English and suggestions about how to proceed with the construction of such theories. We may put our problem this way: What form should a semantic theory of a natural language take to accommodate in the most revealing way the facts about the semantic structure of that language supplied by descriptive research? This question is of primary importance at the present stage of the development of semantics because semantics suffers not from a dearth of facts about meanings and meaning relations in natural languages, but rather from the lack of an adequate theory to organize, systematize, and generalize these facts. Facts about the semantics of natural languages have been contributed in abundance by many diverse fields, including philosophy, linguistics, philology, and \u2026"

For each tensed clause, PUNDIT processes the main verb and its grammatical categories of tense, perfect, and progressive in order to extract three complementary pieces of temporal information. The first is whether a situation has actual time associated with it. Secondly, for each situation that is presumed to take place in actual time, PUNDIT represents its temporal structure as one of three situation types: a state, process, or transition event. The temporal structures of each of these situation types consist of one or more intervals. The intervals are characterized by two features: kinesis, which pertains to their internal structure, and boundedness, which constrains the manner in which they get located in time. Thirdly, the computation of temporal location exploits the three temporal indices proposed in Reichenbach 1947: event time, speech time, and reference time. Here, however, event time is formulated as a single component of the full temporal structure of a situation in order to provide an integrated treatment of tense and aspect."

Complex sentences present a difficult problem in this framework. No simple \"projection method\" has been found by which we could compute their presuppositions from those of their constituent clauses. This paper presents a way to eliminate the projection problem. A recursive definition of \"satisfaction of presuppositions\" is proposed that makes it unnecessary to have any explicit method for assigning presuppositions to compound sentences. A theory of presuppositions becomes a theory of contraints on successive contexts in a fully explicit discourse."

In the TACITUS project at SRI we have developed an approach to abductive inference, called \u201cweighted abduction\u201d, that has resulted in a significant simplification of how the problem of interpreting texts is conceptualized. The interpretation of a text is the minimal explanation of why the text would be true. More precisely, to interpret a text, one must prove the logical form of the text from what is already mutually known, allowing for coercions, merging redundancies where possible, and making assumptions where necessary. It is shown how such \u201clocal pragmatics\u201d problems as reference resolution, the interpretation of compound nominals, the resolution of syntactic ambiguity and metonymy, and schema recognition can be solved in this manner. Moreover, this approach of \u201cinterpretation as abduction\u201d can be combined with the older view of \u201cparsing as deduction\u201d to produce an elegant and thorough integration of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, one that spans the range of linguistic phenomena from phonology to discourse structure. Finally, we discuss means for making the abduction process efficient, possibilities for extending the approach to other pragmatics phenomena, and the semantics of the weights and costs in the abduction scheme."

On this view, the resulting compositional semantic structures of (la)-(ld) could be represented as (2a)-(2d) respectively, which I will refer to as the R-analysis of the semantics of infinitive complements, implying a compositional analysis of control. (R here stands for Rosenbaum, for I believe this analysis reflects an implicit semantic assumption that has been passed on, without much question, since the original syntactic analyses of Rosenbaum (1967).) For concreteness, these are formulated as expressions of Montague's in tensional logic, and are labeled with the logical types of their parts purely for reasons of perspicuity. Here, r(A) is the logical type corresponding to category A, and r(VP) = ((NP, r(S)), i.e., the type assignment of Mon tague's \"Universal Grammar\" is assumed (cf. ?1 below)."

This paper proposes an ontology based on such notions as causation and consequence, rather than on purely temporal primitives. A central notion in the ontology is that of an elementary event-complex called a \"nucleus.\" A nucleus can be thought of as an association of a goal event, or \"culmination,\" with a \"preparatory process\" by which it is accomplished, and a \"consequent state,\" which ensues. Natural-language categories like aspects, futurates, adverbials, and when-clauses are argued to change the temporal/aspectual category of propositions under the control of such a nucleic knowledge representation structure. The same concept of a nucleus plays a central role in a theory of temporal reference, and of the semantics of tense, which we follow McCawley, Partee, and Isard in regarding as an anaphoric category. We claim that any manageable formalism for natural-language temporal descriptions will have to embody such an ontology, as will any usable temporal database for knowledge about events which is to be interrogated using natural language."

It outlines both the general concepts which underlie our research and the details of KRL-0, an experimental implementation of some of these concepts. KRL is an attempt to integrate procedural knowledge with a broad base of declarative forms. These forms provide a variety of ways to express the logical structure of the knowledge, in order to give flexibility in associating procedures (for memory and reasoning) with specific pieces of knowledge, and to control the relative accessibility of different facts and descriptions. The formalism for declarative knowledge is based on structured conceptual objects with associated descriptions. These objects form a network of memory units with several different sorts of linkages, each having well-specified implications for the retrieval process. Procedures can be associated directly with the internal structure of a conceptual object. This procedural attachment allows the steps for a particular operation to be determined by characteristics of the specific entities involved. The control structure of KRL is based on the belief that the next generation of intelligent programs will integrate data-directed and goal-directed processing by using multi-processing. It provides for a priority-ordered multi-process agenda with explicit (user-provided) strategies for scheduling and resource allocation. It provides procedure directories which operate along with process frameworks to allow procedural parameterization of the fundamental system processes for building, comparing, and retrieving memory structures. Future development of KRL will include integrating procedure definition with the descriptive formalism."

Facts of nature require explanations, mathematical propositions demand proof, and plans for action call for justification. Though explaining, proving, and justifying all count as intellectual activities, it would be alien to most modern frameworks to envisage a general scheme within which these activities would be interrelated, and common denominators established. Still, such a program is hardly unreasonable since all three activities involve understanding. One wants to understand nature, one wants to understand mathematical propositions, and one wants to understand plans for action."

                "text": "Virtually all AI and object-oriented programming languages include inheritance systems. Common examples are FRL, KRL, KLONE, NETL, Simula, Smalltalk, Flavors, and Ada. Systems that permit exceptions to inherited properties, which involves a form of nonmonotonic reasoning, remained unformalized until quite recently. The lack of a formal theory hid some defects in existing implementations. One defect was an incorrect treatment of networks with multiple grounded expansions. (A grounded expansion is the nonmonotonic equivalent of a \"theory\" in ordinary monotonic reasoning.) Another defect was a tendency to reason incorrectly when redundant statements are presented. \nWe present a formal mathematical theory of inheritance and show how the defects in existing systems can be corrected. Our formalism bears some relation to default and nonmonotonic logics, but includes an important hierarchical notion the other systems lack. We prove theorems about the consistency, existence, uniqueness, and constructibility of grounded expansions, and we provide a formal semantics for inheritance in terms of constructible lattices of predicates. \nThe formal theory of inheritance is then applied to the formal analysis of a massively parallel computer architecture known as a parallel marker propagation machine (PMPM), of which the best-known example is Fahlman's NETL Machine. This machine has been proposed as a high speed inference engine for AI. We show that a PMPM can perform correct inheritance reasoning only in certain limited cases. However, through a technique known as \"conditioning,\" the topology of a network can be altered to force the PMPM to produce correct results. We show that conditioning is always possible, and present a simple yet efficient conditioning algorithm. \nAn extension to the usual notion of inheritance allows us to infer, if Fred is a citizen and Dick a crook, that Fred dislikes Dick from the relation \"citizens dislike crooks.\" An exception to such a relation might be \"gullible citizens don't dislike elected crooks.\" We extend our earlier results by developing a formal theory of inheritable relations, including exceptions and their interaction with the IS-A \nhierarchy, and showing how a correct implementation on a PMPM may be achieved through conditioning. \n*This research was sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DOD), ARPA Order No. 3597, monitored by the Air Force Avionics Laboratory Under Contract F33615-81-K-1539.

                "text": "Our objective is to understand the notion of type in programming languages, present a model of typed, polymorphic programming languages that reflects recent research in type theory, and examine the relevance of recent research to the design of practical programming languages.\nObject-oriented languages provide both a framework and a motivation for exploring the interaction among the concepts of type, data abstraction, and polymorphism, since they extend the notion of type to data abstraction and since type inheritance is an important form of polymorphism. We develop a \u03bb-calculus-based model for type systems that allows us to explore these interactions in a simple setting, unencumbered by complexities of production programming languages.\nThe evolution of languages from untyped universes to monomorphic and then polymorphic type systems is reviewed. Mechanisms for polymorphism such as overloading, coercion, subtyping, and parameterization are examined. A unifying framework for polymorphic type systems is developed in terms of the typed \u03bb-calculus augmented to include binding of types by quantification as well as binding of values by abstraction.\nThe typed \u03bb-calculus is augmented by universal quantification to model generic functions with type parameters, existential quantification and packaging (information hiding) to model abstract data types, and bounded quantification to model subtypes and type inheritance. In this way we obtain a simple and precise characterization of a powerful type system that includes abstract data types, parametric polymorphism, and multiple inheritance in a single consistent framework. The mechanisms for type checking for the augmented \u03bb-calculus are discussed.\nThe augmented typed \u03bb-calculus is used as a programming language for a variety of illustrative examples. We christen this language Fun because fun instead of \u03bb is the functional abstraction keyword and because it is pleasant to deal with.\nFun is mathematically simple and can serve as a basis for the design and implementation of real programming languages with type facilities that are more powerful and expressive than those of existing programming languages. In particular, it provides a basis for the design of strongly typed object-oriented languages."

For example, constructing the category of \u201cthings to sell at a garage sale\u201d can be instrumental to achieving the goal of selling unwanted possessions. These categories differ from common categories (e.g., \u201cfruit,\u201d \u201cfurniture\u201d) in that ad hoc categories violate the correlational structure of the environment and are not well established in memory. Regarding the latter property, the category concepts, concept-to-instance associations, and instance-to-concept associations structuring ad hoc categories are shown to be much less established in memory than those of common categories. Regardless of these differences, however, ad hoc categories possess graded structures (i.e., typicality gradients) as salient as those structuring common categories. This appears to be the result of a similarity comparison process that imposes graded structure on any category regardless of type."

This work extends previous research on the semi-automatic extraction of lexical information from machine-readable versions of conventional dictionaries (MRDs) (see e.g. the papers and references in Boguraev & Briscoe, 1989; Walker et al., 1988). The motivation for this and previous research using MRDs is that entirely manual development of lexicons for practical NLP applications is infeasible, given the labour-intensive nature of lexicography (e.g. Atkins, 1988) and the resources likely to be allocated to NLP in the foreseeable future. In this paper, we motivate a particular approach to lexical semantics, briefly demonstrate its computational tractability, and explore the possibility of extracting the lexical information this approach requires from MRDs and, to some extent, textual corpora."
