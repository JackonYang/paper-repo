The dynamic link architecture exploits correlations in the fine-scale temporal structure of cellular signals to group neurons dynamically into higher-order entities. These entities represent a rich structure and can code for high-level objects. To demonstrate the capabilities of the dynamic link architecture, a program was implemented that can recognize human faces and other objects from video images. Memorized objects are represented by sparse graphs, whose vertices are labeled by a multiresolution description in terms of a local power spectrum, and whose edges are labeled by geometrical distance vectors. Object recognition can be formulated as elastic graph matching, which is performed here by stochastic optimization of a matching cost function. The implementation on a transputer network achieved recognition of human faces and office objects from gray-level camera images. The performance of the program is evaluated by a statistical analysis of recognition results from a portrait gallery comprising images of 87 persons. >"

The system is an application of the dynamic link architecture, which owes its strength to an enhancement of tradition neural networks by a new kind of variable to express the hierarchical grouping of neurons. This capability is used to group primitive local feature detectors (Gabor-based wavelets) into composite feature detectors (jets) and to preserve neighborhood relationships between jets when they lose position information on the way from the image domain to the object domain. Due to the potential for grouping, objects can be represented as attributed graphs, with jets serving as attributes. Recognition is formulated as graph matching and is implemented as a topologically constrained diffusion of image-object links. A hierarchical sequence of matches, from low-frequency components of jets to high-frequency components, is used. Size invariance is achieved by interposing diffusion steps in magnification space. The system is implemented on a network of transputers"

Gray-level images are represented by a resolution hierarchy of local Gabor components, which are all scaled and rotated versions of each other. The components centered on one image point form a Gabor jet. A single jet provides a distortion-insensitive local representation of part of an image. Object recognition is achieved by matching image point jets to jets in stored prototype patterns. For a selected image jet the best matches are determined, under a constraint preserving spatial arrangement. The procedure amounts to labeled graph matching, with Gabor jets forming labels to nodes and topology determining links. A contrast-insensitive similarity measure provides for invariance with respect to lighting conditions. The authors have formulated the matching procedure as an optimization task solved by diffusion of match points. This diffusion is controlled by a potential determined by jet similarity and the topology-preserving constraint. The algorithm implements a neural network architecture.<<ETX>>"

Using the two-dimensional (2D) spatial and spectral response profiles described in the previous two reports, we test Daugman's generalization of Marcelja's hypothesis that simple receptive fields belong to a class of linear spatial filters analogous to those described by Gabor and referred to here as 2D Gabor filters. 2. In the space domain, we found 2D Gabor filters that fit the 2D spatial response profile of each simple cell in the least-squared error sense (with a simplex algorithm), and we show that the residual error is devoid of spatial structure and statistically indistinguishable from random error. 3. Although a rigorous statistical approach was not possible with our spectral data, we also found a Gabor function that fit the 2D spectral response profile of each simple cell and observed that the residual errors are everywhere small and unstructured. 4. As an assay of spatial linearity in two dimensions, on which the applicability of Gabor theory is dependent, we compare the filter parameters estimated from the independent 2D spatial and spectral measurements described above. Estimates of most parameters from the two domains are highly correlated, indicating that assumptions about spatial linearity are valid. 5. Finally, we show that the functional form of the 2D Gabor filter provides a concise mathematical expression, which incorporates the important spatial characteristics of simple receptive fields demonstrated in the previous two reports. Prominent here are 1) Cartesian separable spatial response profiles, 2) spatial receptive fields with staggered subregion placement, 3) Cartesian separable spectral response profiles, 4) spectral response profiles with axes of symmetry not including the origin, and 5) the uniform distribution of spatial phase angles. 6. We conclude that the Gabor function provides a useful and reasonably accurate description of most spatial aspects of simple receptive fields. Thus it seems that an optimal strategy has evolved for sampling images simultaneously in the 2D spatial and spatial frequency domains."

Diffculties of this \"conventional theory\" are traced back to a specific deficiency: there is no way to express relations between active cells (as for instance their representing parts of the same object). A new theory is proposed to cure this deficiency. It introduces a new kind of dynamical control, termed synaptic modulation, according to which synapses switch between a conducting and a non- conducting state. The dynamics of this variable is controlled on a fast time scale by correlations in the temporal fine structure of cellular signals. Furthermore, conventional synaptic plasticity is replaced by a refined version. Synaptic modulation and plasticity form the basis for short-term and long-term memory, respectively. Signal correlations, shaped by the variable network, express structure and relationships within objects. In particular, the figure-ground problem may be solved in this way. Synaptic modulation introduces flexibility into cerebral networks which is necessary to solve the invariance problem. Since momentarily useless connections are deactivated, interference between different memory traces can be reduced, and memory capacity increased, in comparison with conventional associative memory."

The conjecture is supported and illustrated by dynamic simulation. Applications to sensory segmentation, to invariant pattern recognition, and to resonant projection between homeomorphic structures are discussed."
