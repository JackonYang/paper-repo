Our method uses local criteria and yet produces results that reflect global properties of the image. We develop a framework that provides specific definitions of what it means for an image to be under- or over-segmented. We then present an efficient algorithm for computing a segmentation that is neither under- nor over-segmented according to these definitions. Our segmentation criterion is based on intensity differences between neighboring pixels. An important characteristic of the approach is that it is able to preserve detail in low-variability regions while ignoring detail in high-variability regions, which we illustrate with several examples on both real and synthetic images."

Rather than focusing on local features and their consistencies in the image data, our approach aims at extracting the global impression of an image. We treat image segmentation as a graph partitioning problem and propose a novel global criterion, the normalized cut, for segmenting the graph. The normalized cut criterion measures both the total dissimilarity between the different groups as well as the total similarity within the groups. We show that an efficient computational technique based on a generalized eigenvalue problem can be used to optimize this criterion. We have applied this approach to segmenting static images and found results very encouraging."

A single segmentation can be determined using a linear number of evaluations of a uniformity predicate. However, minimising the number of regions is shown to be an NP-complete problem. We also show that the variational approach to segmentation, based on minimising a criterion combining the overall variance of regions and the number of regions, also gives rise to an NP-complete problem.When a library of object models is available, segmenting the image becomes a problem of scene analysis. A sufficient condition for the reconstruction of a 3D scene from a 2D image to be solvable in polynomial time is that the scene contains no cycles of mutually occluding objects and that no range information can be deduced from the image. It is known that relaxing the no cycles condition renders the problem NP-complete. We show that relaxing the no range information condition also produces an NP-complete problem."

Recently, a number of authors have demonstrated good performance on this task using methods that are based on eigenvectors of the affinity matrix. These approaches are extremely attractive in that they are based on simple eigendecomposition algorithms whose stability is well understood. Nevertheless, the use of eigendecompositions in the context of segmentation is far from well understood. In this paper we give a unified treatment of these algorithms, and show the close connections between them while highlighting their distinguishing features. We then prove results on eigenvectors of block matrices that allow us to analyze the performance of these algorithms in simple grouping settings. Finally, we use our analysis to motivate a variation on the existing methods that combines aspects from different eigenvector segmentation algorithms. We illustrate our analysis with results on real and synthetic images."

The data to be clustered are represented by an undirected adjacency graph G with arc capacities assigned to reflect the similarity between the linked vertices. Clustering is achieved by removing arcs of G to form mutually exclusive subgraphs such that the largest inter-subgraph maximum flow is minimized. For graphs of moderate size ( approximately 2000 vertices), the optimal solution is obtained through partitioning a flow and cut equivalent tree of G, which can be efficiently constructed using the Gomory-Hu algorithm (1961). However for larger graphs this approach is impractical. New theorems for subgraph condensation are derived and are then used to develop a fast algorithm which hierarchically constructs and partitions a partially equivalent tree of much reduced size. This algorithm results in an optimal solution equivalent to that obtained by partitioning the complete equivalent tree and is able to handle very large graphs with several hundred thousand vertices. The new clustering algorithm is applied to the image segmentation problem. The segmentation is achieved by effectively searching for closed contours of edge elements (equivalent to minimum cuts in G), which consist mostly of strong edges, while rejecting contours containing isolated strong edges. This method is able to accurately locate region boundaries and at the same time guarantees the formation of closed edge contours. >"

Feature space of any nature can be processed, and as an example, color image segmentation is discussed. The segmentation is completely autonomous, only its class is chosen by the user. Thus, the same program can produce a high quality edge image, or provide, by extracting all the significant colors, a preprocessor for content-based query systems. A 512/spl times/512 color image is analyzed in less than 10 seconds on a standard workstation. Gray level images are handled as color images having only the lightness coordinate."

We describe two polynomial-time digraph algorithms for finding the global minima of this energy. One of the algorithms is completely general, minimizing the functional for any choice of modeling information. It runs in a few seconds on a 256/spl times/256 image. The other algorithm applies to a subclass of functionals, but has the advantage of being extremely parallelizable. Neither algorithm requires initialization."

Properties of the mean shift are reviewed and its convergence on lattices is proven. The proposed filtering method associates with each pixel in the image the closest local mode in the density distribution of the joint domain. Segmentation into a piecewise constant structure requires only one more step, fusion of the regions associated with nearby modes. The proposed technique has two parameters controlling the resolution in the spatial and range domains. Since convergence is guaranteed, the technique does not require the intervention of the user to stop the filtering at the desired image quality. Several examples, for gray and color images, show the versatility of the method and compare favorably with results described in the literature for the same images."

Development of these clustering algorithms was based on examples from two-dimensional space because we wanted to copy the human perception of gestalts or point groupings. On the other hand, all the methods considered apply to higher dimensional spaces and even to general metric spaces. Advantages of these methods include determinacy, easy interpretation of the resulting clusters, conformity to gestalt principles of perceptual organization, and invariance of results under monotone transformations of interpoint distance. Brief discussion is made of the application of cluster detection to taxonomy and the selection of good feature spaces for pattern recognition. Detailed analyses of several planar cluster detection problems are illustrated by text and figures. The well-known Fisher iris data, in four-dimensional space, have been analyzed by these methods also. PL/1 programs to implement the minimal spanning tree methods have been fully debugged."

In this framework, a user labels an image as positive if the image contains the concept. Each example image is a bag of instances (sub-images) where only the bag is labeled-not the individual instances (sub-images). From a small collection of positive and negative examples, the system learns the concept and uses it to retrieve images that contain the concept from a large database. The learned \"concepts\" are simple templates that capture the color, texture and spatial properties of the class of images. We introduced this method earlier in the domain of natural scene classification using simple, low resolution sub-images as instances. In this paper, we extend the bag generator (the mechanism which takes an image and generates a set of instances) to generate more complex instances using multiple cues on segmented high resolution images. We show that this method can be used to learn certain object class concepts (e.g. cars) in addition, to natural scenes."

Classic applications are illustrated such as Shaw's picture description language (1969) applied to bubble chamber photographs, and Ledley's chromosome grammar ( 1965). The student with no particular interest in pattern recognition, who nevertheless desires to grasp a quick overview of what formal language theory is all about, could read this chapter. A minimum of preliminary definitions and notation must be waded through before learning about-types of grammars (regular, context-free, context-sensitive), equivalency of grammars, syntaxdirected translations, and deterministic, nondeterministic, and stochastic systems. Higher dimensional grammars are treated in Chapter Three, i.e., those allowing more complex primitive description and interconnection capabilities. Tree, web, plex, and shape grammars are each described with accompanying examples which make the material very easy to absorb. Chapter Four, on recognition and translation of syntactic structures, presents that integral part of formal language theory known as automata theory. The one-to-one correspondences between types of string grammars and automata are presented here, namely finite automation/regular grammar, push-down automaton/context-free grammar, linear-bounded automaton/ context-sensitive grammar, and Turing machine/unrestricted grammar. Quite properly, the authors restrict their attention to the finite and push-down automata used to accept or reject input strings and to automata for tree recognition, since these are the models thus far proved to be most useful for syntactic pattern recognition tasks. Chapter Five introduces stocastic grammars, languages, and recognizers. The material is well covered and brings the reader up to date (1978). As the authors mention, the impact of this theory on syntactic pattern processing has not been thoroughly realized, and references are cited for one interested in pursuing the topic further. The final chapter deals with grammatical inference and exemplifies the principalideas underlying the problem of obtaining a pattern grammar from a set of samples. Again, the material in this chapter is presented in a logical and easy to understand format. By this time the reader is beginning to understand the limitations of the linguistic aspect of syntactic pattern recognition (Reviewer's opinion), and will draw his or her attention to some of the material which came out of this work in the late sixties, which can be described as structural pattern recognition, and which is the topic of the book review which follows."

The goal is to preprocess the point set S, such that queries can be answered as efficiently as possible. We assume that the dimension d is a constant independent of n. Although reasonably good solutions to this problem exist when d is small, as d increases the performance of these algorithms degrades rapidly. We present a randomized algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor searching. Given any set of n points S \u2282 E, and a constant \u01eb > 0, we produce a data structure, such that given any query point, a point of S will be reported whose distance from the query point is at most a factor of (1 + \u01eb) from that of the true nearest neighbor. Our algorithm runs in O(log n) expected time and requires O(n log n) space. The data structure can be built in O(n) expected time. The constant factors depend on d and \u01eb. Because of the practical importance of nearest neighbor searching in higher dimensions, we have implemented a practical variant of this algorithm, and show empirically that for many point distributions this variant of the algorithm finds the nearest neighbor in moderately large dimension significantly faster than existing practical approaches."
