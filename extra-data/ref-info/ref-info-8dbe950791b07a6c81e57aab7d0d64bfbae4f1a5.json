Given a machine segmentation and a GT reference, performance measures are needed. We propose to consider the image segmentation problem as one of data clustering and, as a consequence, to use measures for comparing clusterings developed in statistics and machine learning. By doing so, we obtain a variety of performance measures which have not been used before in computer vision. In particular, some of these measures have the highly desired property of being a metric. Experimental results are reported on both synthetic and real data to validate the measures and compare them with others."

The first set is designed for the situation where ground truth is available; while the second for the situation where ground truth is not available. Based on a test bank of more than 50 images for which ground truth is available, we computed both sets of evaluation measures and then correlated the two sets. Experimental results show that the first set of measures proposed agree with human (subjective) visual evaluation and the second set of measures correlates well with the first set, an indication of the usefulness of this set of measures in assessing the quality of image segmentation results even when ground truth is not available."

A tool is used to objectively compare a machine generated segmentation against the specified ground truth. Four research groups have contributed to evaluate their own algorithm for segmenting a range image into planar patches."

However, it is well known that elemental segmentation techniques based on boundary or region information often fail to produce accurate segmentation results. Hence, in the last few years, there has been a tendency towards algorithms which take advantage of the complementary nature of such information. This paper reviews different segmentation proposals which integrate edge and region information and highlights 7 different strategies and methods to fuse such information. In contrast with other surveys which only describe and compare qualitatively different approaches, this survey deals with a real quantitative comparison. In this sense, key methods have been programmed and their accuracy analyzed and compared using synthetic and real images. A discussion justified with experimental results is given and the code is available on Internet."

We present an automated framework for evaluating the performance of range image segmentation algorithms. Automated tuning of algorithm parameters in this framework results in performance as good as that previously obtained with careful manual tuning by the algorithm developers. Use of multiple training and test sets of images provides the basis for a test of the significance of performance differences between algorithms. The framework implementation includes range images, ground truth overlays, program source code, and shell scripts. This framework should make it possible to objectively and reliably compare the performance of range image segmentation algorithms; allow informed experimental feedback for the design of improved segmentation algorithms. The framework is demonstrated using range images, but in principle it could be used to evaluate region segmentation algorithms for any type of image."

The control scheme of texture segmentation has been conceptualized as two modular processes: (1) feature computation and (2) segmentation of homogeneous regions based on the feature values. Three feature extraction methods are considered: gray level co-occurrence matrix, Laws' texture energy and Gabor multi-channel filtering. Three segmentation algorithms are considered: fuzzy c-means clustering, square-error clustering and split-and-merge. A set of 35 real scene images with manually-specified ground truth was compiled. Performance is measured against ground truth on real images using region-based and pixel-based performance metrics."

Compared to other commonly used features such as edges, there are relatively few work on curvilinear structure detection and its performance evaluation. In this paper we propose a novel supervised methodology for evaluating the performance of curvilinear structure detection algorithms. We consider the two aspects of performance, namely the detection rate and detection accuracy, respectively in contrast to their mixed handling in earlier approaches that typically produces biased impression of detection quality. By doing so, the proposed performance measures lead to a more informative and precise performance characterization. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach using both synthetic and real examples."

Optimization of the parameter set is a particularly critical task since the range of parameter variability is often quite large: parameter selection depends on surface type, sensors and the required speed which strongly of affect performance. A framework for parameter optimization is proposed based on genetic algorithms. Such algorithms allow a general approach that has been successfully applied on different state-of-the-art segmenters and different range image databases."

These criteria depend on a measure of similarity between two different clusterings of the same set of data; the measure essentially considers how each pair of data points is assigned in each clustering."

The clustering problem has been addressed in many contexts and by researchers in many disciplines; this reflects its broad appeal and usefulness as one of the steps in exploratory data analysis. However, clustering is a difficult problem combinatorially, and differences in assumptions and contexts in different communities has made the transfer of useful generic concepts and methodologies slow to occur. This paper presents an overviewof pattern clustering methods from a statistical pattern recognition perspective, with a goal of providing useful advice and references to fundamental concepts accessible to the broad community of clustering practitioners. We present a taxonomy of clustering techniques, and identify cross-cutting themes and recent advances. We also describe some important applications of clustering algorithms such as image segmentation, object recognition, and information retrieval."

The measure, Bk , is derived from the matching matrix, [mij ], formed by cutting the two hierarchical trees and counting the number of matching entries in the k clusters in each tree. The mean and variance of Bk are determined under the assumption that the margins of [mij ] are fixed. Thus, Bk represents a collection of measures for k = 2, \u2026, n \u2013 1. (k, Bk ) plots are found to be useful in portraying the similarity of two clusterings. Bk is compared to other measures of similarity proposed respectively by Baker (1974) and Rand (1971). The use of (k, Bk ) plots for studying clustering methods is explored by a series of Monte Carlo sampling experiments. An example of the use of (k, Bk ) on real data is given."

The criterion, called variation of information (VI), measures the amount of information lost and gained in changing from clustering \\({\\cal C}\\) to clustering \\({\\cal C}'\\). The criterion makes no assumptions about how the clusterings were generated and applies to both soft and hard clusterings. The basic properties of VI are presented and discussed from the point of view of comparing clusterings. In particular, the VI is positive, symmetric and obeys the triangle inequality. Thus, surprisingly enough, it is a true metric on the space of clusterings."

Any clustering method has to embed the documents in a suitable similarity space. While several clustering methods and the associated similarity measures have been proposed in the past, there is no systematic comparative study of the impact of similarity metrics on cluster quality, possibly because the popular cost criteria do not readily translate across qualitatively different metrics. We observe that in domains such as YAHOO that provide a categorization by human experts, a useful criteria for comparisons across similarity metrics is indeed available. We then compare four popular similarity measures (Euclidean, cosine, Pearson correlation and extended Jaccard) in conjunction with several clustering techniques (random, self-organizing feature map, hyper-graph partitioning, generalized kmeans, weighted graph partitioning), on high dimensionai sparse data representing web documents. Performance is measured against a human-imposed classification into news categories and industry categories. We conduct a number of experiments and use t-tests to assure statistical significance of results. Cosine and extended Jaccard similarities emerge as the best measures to capture human categorization behavior, while Euclidean performs poorest. Also, weighted graph partitioning approaches are clearly superior to all others."

                "text": "In~[1] a cluster algorithm for graphs was introduced called the Markov cluster algorithm or MCL~algorithm. The algorithm is based on simulation of (stochastic) flow in graphs by means of alternation of two operators, expansion and inflation. The results in~[2] establish an intrinsic relationship between the corresponding algebraic process (MCL~process) and cluster structure in the iterands and the limits of the process. Several kinds of experiments conducted with the MCL~algorithm are described here. Test cases with varying homogeneity characteristics are used to establish some of the particular strengths and weaknesses of the algorithm. In general the algorithm performs well, except for graphs which are very homogeneous (such as weakly connected grids) and for which the natural cluster diameter (i.e. the diameter of a subgraph induced by a natural cluster) is large. This can be understood in terms of the flow characteristics of the MCL~algorithm and the heuristic on which the algorithm is grounded. A generic performance criterion for clusterings of weighted graphs is derived, by a stepwise refinement of a simple and appealing criterion for simple graphs. The most refined criterion uses a particular Schur convex function, several properties of which are established. A metric is defined on the space of partitions, which is useful for comparing different clusterings of the same graph. The metric is compared with the metric known as the equivalence mismatch coefficient. The performance criterion and the metric are used for the quantitative measurement of experiments conducted with the MCL~algorithm on randomly generated test graphs with 10000 nodes. Scaling the MCL~algorithm requires a regime of pruning the stochastic matrices which need to be computed. The effect of pruning on the quality of the retrieved clusterings is also investigated.

The method can be used with any clustering algorithm; it provides a means of rationally defining an optimum number of clusters, and can also detect the lack of structure in data.
