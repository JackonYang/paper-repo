As a step towards this goal, this paper proposes a method to automatically generate the semantical annotations for a sports video by integrating the text(c1osed-caption) and image stream. we first segment the text data and extract segments which are meaningful to grasp the story of the video, then extract the actors, the actions and the events of each scene which are useful for information retrieval by using the linguistic cues and the domain knowledge. We also segment the image stream so that each segment can associate with each text segment extracted above by using the image cues. Finally we can annotate the video by associating the text segments with the image segments. Some experimental results are presented and discussed in this paper."

This challenging but important subject has mostly been ignored in the past due to several problems one of which is the lack of realistic and annotated video datasets. Our first contribution is to address this limitation and to investigate the use of movie scripts for automatic annotation of human actions in videos. We evaluate alternative methods for action retrieval from scripts and show benefits of a text-based classifier. Using the retrieved action samples for visual learning, we next turn to the problem of action classification in video. We present a new method for video classification that builds upon and extends several recent ideas including local space-time features, space-time pyramids and multi-channel non-linear SVMs. The method is shown to improve state-of-the-art results on the standard KTH action dataset by achieving 91.8% accuracy. Given the inherent problem of noisy labels in automatic annotation, we particularly investigate and show high tolerance of our method to annotation errors in the training set. We finally apply the method to learning and classifying challenging action classes in movies and show promising results."

Learning the joint distribution of image regions and words has many applications. We consider in detail predicting words associated with whole images (auto-annotation) and corresponding to particular image regions (region naming). Auto-annotation might help organize and access large collections of images. Region naming is a model of object recognition as a process of translating image regions to words, much as one might translate from one language to another. Learning the relationships between image regions and semantic correlates (words) is an interesting example of multi-modal data mining, particularly because it is typically hard to apply data mining techniques to collections of images. We develop a number of models for the joint distribution of image regions and words, including several which explicitly learn the correspondence between regions and words. We study multi-modal and correspondence extensions to Hofmann's hierarchical clustering/aspect model, a translation model adapted from statistical machine translation (Brown et al.), and a multi-modal extension to mixture of latent Dirichlet allocation (MoM-LDA). All models are assessed using a large collection of annotated images of real scenes. We study in depth the difficult problem of measuring performance. For the annotation task, we look at prediction performance on held out data. We present three alternative measures, oriented toward different types of task. Measuring the performance of correspondence methods is harder, because one must determine whether a word has been placed on the right region of an image. We can use annotation performance as a proxy measure, but accurate measurement requires hand labeled data, and thus must occur on a smaller scale. We show results using both an annotation proxy, and manually labeled data."

We propose to extend the notion of spatial interest points into the spatio-temporal domain and show how the resulting features often reflect interesting events that can be used for a compact representation of video data as well as for its interpretation. To detect spatio-temporal events, we build on the idea of the Harris and Forstner interest point operators and detect local structures in space-time where the image values have significant local variations in both space and time. We then estimate the spatio-temporal extents of the detected events and compute their scale-invariant spatio-temporal descriptors. Using such descriptors, we classify events and construct video representation in terms of labeled space-time points. For the problem of human motion analysis, we illustrate how the proposed method allows for detection of walking people in scenes with occlusions and dynamic backgrounds."

While each of these can be conducted independently, recognition improves when interactions between these elements are considered. Motivated by psychological studies of human perception, we present a Bayesian approach which unifies the inference processes involved in object classification and localization, action understanding and perception of object reaction. Traditional approaches for object classification and action understanding have relied on shape features and movement analysis respectively. By placing object classification and localization in a video interpretation framework, we can localize and classify objects which are either hard to localize due to clutter or hard to recognize due to lack of discriminative features. Similarly, by applying context on human movements from the objects on which these movements impinge and the effects of these movements, we can segment and recognize actions which are either too subtle to perceive or too hard to recognize using motion features alone."

In particular, we develop a Dynamically Multi-Linked Hidden Markov Model (DML-HMM) to interpret group activities involving multiple objects captured in an outdoor scene. The model is based on the discovery of salient dynamic interlinks among multiple temporal events using DPNs. Object temporal events are detected and labeled using Gaussian Mixture Models with automatic model order selection. A DML-HMM is built using Schwarz's Bayesian Information Criterion based factorisation resulting in its topology being intrinsically determined by the underlying causality and temporal order among different object events. Our experiments demonstrate that its performance on modelling group activities in a noisy outdoor scene is superior compared to that of a Multi-Observation Hidden Markov Model (MOHMM), a Parallel Hidden Markov Model (PaHMM) and a Coupled Hidden Markov Model (CHMM)."

Most approaches use co-occurrence of \"nouns\" and image features over large datasets to determine the correspondence, but many correspondence ambiguities remain. We further constrain the correspondence problem by exploiting additional language constructs to improve the learning process from weakly labeled data. We consider both \"prepositions\" and \"comparative adjectives\" which are used to express relationships between objects. If the models of such relationships can be determined, they help resolve correspondence ambiguities. However, learning models of these relationships requires solving the correspondence problem. We simultaneously learn the visual features defining \"nouns\" and the differential visual features defining such \"binary-relationships\" using an EM-based approach."

The fundamental idea, inspired by work in speech recognition, is to divide the inference problem into two levels. The lower level is performed using standard independent probabilistic temporal event detectors such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) to propose candidate detections of low level temporal features. The outputs of these detectors provide the input stream for a stochastic context-free grammar parsing mechanism. The grammar and parser provide longer range temporal constraints, disambiguate uncertain low level detections, and allow the inclusion of a priori knowledge about the structure of temporal events in a given domain. To achieve such a system we provide techniques for generating a discrete symbol stream from continuous low level detectors and for enforcing temporal exclusion constraints during parsing. We demonstrate the approach in several experiments using both visual and other sensing data."

In this paper, we present a context sensitive grammar in an And-Or graph representation which will produce a large set of composite graphical templates to account for the wide variabilities of cloth configurations, such as T-shirts, jackets, etc. In a supervised learning phase, we ask an artist to draw sketches on a set of dressed people, and we decompose the sketches into categories of cloth and body components: collars, shoulders, cuff, hands, pants, shoes etc. Each component has a number of distinct subtemplates (sub-graphs). These sub-templates serve as leafnodes in a big And-Or graph where an And-node represents a decomposition of the graph into sub-configurations with Markov relations for context and constraints (soft or hard), and an Or-node is a switch for choosing one out of a set of alternative And-nodes (sub-configurations) - similar to a node in stochastic context free grammar (SCFG). This representation integrates the SCFG for structural variability and the Markov (graphical) model for context. An algorithm which integrates the bottom-up proposals and the topdown information is proposed to infer the composite cloth template from the image."

This is tremendously challenging due to the huge variation in imaged appearance of each character and the weakness and ambiguity of available annotation. However, we demonstrate that high precision can be achieved by combining multiple sources of information, both visual and textual. The principal novelties that we introduce are: (i) automatic generation of time stamped character annotation by aligning subtitles and transcripts; (ii) strengthening the supervisory information by identifying when characters are speaking; (iii) using complementary cues of face matching and clothing matching to propose common annotations for face tracks. Results are presented on episodes of the TV series \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d."

The learning is unsupervised in the sense that we are given a training dataset of images containing the object in cluttered backgrounds but we do not know the position or boundary of the object. The structure learning is performed by a bottom-up and top-down process. The bottom-up process is a novel form of hierarchical clustering which recursively composes proposals for simple structures to generate proposals for more complex structures. We combine standard clustering with the suspicious coincidence principle and the competitive exclusion principle to prune the number of proposals to a practical number and avoid an exponential explosion of possible structures. The hierarchical clustering stops automatically, when it fails to generate new proposals, and outputs a proposal for the object model. The top-down process validates the proposals and fills in missing elements. We tested our approach by using it to learn a hierarchical compositional model for parsing and segmenting horses on Weizmann dataset. We show that the resulting model is comparable with (or better than) alternative methods. The versatility of our approach is demonstrated by learning models for other objects (e.g., faces, pianos, butterflies, monitors, etc.). It is worth noting that the low-levels of the object hierarchies automatically learn generic image features while the higher levels learn object specific features."

In these cases, the observations are usually modeled as multinomial distributions over a discrete vocabulary, and the HMM parameters are set to maximize the likelihood of the observations. This paper presents a new Markovian sequence model, closely related to HMMs, that allows observations to be represented as arbitrary overlapping features (such as word, capitalization, formatting, part-of-speech), and defines the conditional probability of state sequences given observation sequences. It does this by using the maximum entropy framework to fit a set of exponential models that represent the probability of a state given an observation and the previous state. We present positive experimental results on the segmentation of FAQ\u2019s."

By parameterized gesture we mean gestures that exhibit a systematic spatial variation; one example is a point gesture where the relevant parameter is the two-dimensional direction. Our approach is to extend the standard hidden Markov model method of gesture recognition by including a global parametric variation in the output probabilities of the HMM states. Using a linear model of dependence, we formulate an expectation-maximization (EM) method for training the parametric HMM. During testing, a similar EM algorithm simultaneously maximizes the output likelihood of the PHMM for the given sequence and estimates the quantifying parameters. Using visually derived and directly measured three-dimensional hand position measurements as input, we present results that demonstrate the recognition superiority of the PHMM over standard HMM techniques, as well as greater robustness in parameter estimation with respect to noise in the input features. Finally, we extend the PHMM to handle arbitrary smooth (nonlinear) dependencies. The nonlinear formulation requires the use of a generalized expectation-maximization (GEM) algorithm for both training and the simultaneous recognition of the gesture and estimation of the value of the parameter. We present results on a pointing gesture, where the nonlinear approach permits the natural spherical coordinate parameterization of pointing direction."

Our method represents the human body and its parts by an AND/OR graph, which is a multi-level mixture of Markov random fields (MRFs). Max-margin learning, which is a generalization of the training algorithm for support vector machines (SVMs), is used to learn the parameters of the AND/OR graph model discriminatively. There are four advantages from this combination of AND/OR graphs and max-margin learning. Firstly, the AND/OR graph allows us to handle enormous articulated poses with a compact graphical model. Secondly, max-margin learning has more discriminative power than the traditional maximum likelihood approach. Thirdly, the parameters of the AND/OR graph model are optimized globally. In particular, the weights of the appearance model for individual nodes and the relative importance of spatial relationships between nodes are learnt simultaneously. Finally, the kernel trick can be used to handle high dimensional features and to enable complex similarity measure of shapes. We perform comparison experiments on the base ball datasets, showing significant improvements over state of the art methods."

We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results.

                "text": "In many multivariate domains, we are interested in analyzing the dependency structure of the underlying distribution, e.g., whether two variables are in direct interaction. We can represent dependency structures using Bayesian network models. To analyze a given data set, Bayesian model selection attempts to find the most likely (MAP) model, and uses its structure to answer these questions. However, when the amount of available data is modest, there might be many models that have non-negligible posterior. Thus, we want compute the Bayesian posterior of a feature, i.e., the total posterior probability of all models that contain it. In this paper, we propose a new approach for this task. We first show how to efficiently compute a sum over the exponential number of networks that are consistent with a fixed order over network variables. This allows us to compute, for a given order, both the marginal probability of the data and the posterior of a feature. We then use this result as the basis for an algorithm that approximates the Bayesian posterior of a feature. Our approach uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, but over orders rather than over network structures. The space of orders is smaller and more regular than the space of structures, and has much a smoother posterior \u201clandscape\u201d. We present empirical results on synthetic and real-life datasets that compare our approach to full model averaging (when possible), to MCMC over network structures, and to a non-Bayesian bootstrap approach."

In Study 1, temporal order overrode covariation information, leading to spurious causal inferences when the temporal cues were misleading. In Study 2, both temporal order and intervention contributed to accurate causal inference well beyond that achievable through covariational data alone. Together, the studies show that people use both temporal-order and interventional cues to infer causal structure and that these cues dominate the available statistical information. A hypothesis-driven account of learning is endorsed, whereby people use cues such as temporal order to generate initial models and then test these models against the incoming covariational data."

One of the hard problems in this area is how to effectively learn the structure of a belief network from incomplete data--that is, in the presence of missing values or hidden variables. In a recent paper, I introduced an algorithm called Structural EM that combines the standard Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, which optimizes parameters, with structure search for model selection. That algorithm learns networks based on penalized likelihood scores, which include the BIC/MDL score and various approximations to the Bayesian score. In this paper, I extend Structural EM to deal directly with Bayesian model selection. I prove the convergence of the resulting algorithm and show how to apply it for learning a large class of probabilistic models, including Bayesian networks and some variants thereof."

We define a concept of word-by-word alignment between such pairs of sentences. For any given pair of such sentences each of our models assigns a probability to each of the possible word-by-word alignments. We give an algorithm for seeking the most probable of these alignments. Although the algorithm is suboptimal, the alignment thus obtained accounts well for the word-by-word relationships in the pair of sentences. We have a great deal of data in French and English from the proceedings of the Canadian Parliament. Accordingly, we have restricted our work to these two languages; but we feel that because our algorithms have minimal linguistic content they would work well on other pairs of languages. We also feel, again because of the minimal linguistic content of our algorithms, that it is reasonable to argue that word-by-word alignments are inherent in any sufficiently large bilingual corpus."
