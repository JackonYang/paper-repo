                "text": "This paper reports on a novel technique for literature indexing and searching in a mechanized library system. The notion of relevance is taken as the key concept in the theory of information retrieval and a comparative concept of relevance is explicated in terms of the theory of probability. The resulting technique called \u201cProbabilistic Indexing,\u201d allows a computing machine, given a request for information, to make a statistical inference and derive a number (called the \u201crelevance number\u201d) for each document, which is a measure of the probability that the document will satisfy the given request. The result of a search is an ordered list of those documents which satisfy the request ranked according to their probable relevance.\nThe paper goes on to show that whereas in a conventional library system the cross-referencing (\u201csee\u201d and \u201csee also\u201d) is based solely on the \u201csemantical closeness\u201d between index terms, statistical measures of closeness between index terms can be defined and computed. Thus, given an arbitrary request consisting of one (or many) index term(s), a machine can elaborate on it to increase the probability of selecting relevant documents that would not otherwise have been selected.\nFinally, the paper suggests an interpretation of the whole library problem as one where the request is considered as a clue on the basis of which the library system makes a concatenated statistical inference in order to provide as an output an ordered list of those documents which most probably satisfy the information needs of the user."

Two drawbacks of the available automatic indexing methods are the absence of reliable linguistic inputs during the indexing process and the lack of formal, analytical proofs concerning the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The precision weighting procedure described in the present study uses relevance criteria to weight the terms occurring in user queries as a function of the balance between relevant and nonrelevant documents in which these terms occur; this approximates a semantic know-how of term importance. Formal mathematical proofs are given under well-defined conditions of the effectiveness of the method."

These techniques are presented as a natural extension of weighting methods using information about the distribution of index terms in documents in general. A series of relevance weighting functions is derived and is justified by theoretical considerations. In particular, it is shown that specific weighted search methods are implied by a general probabilistic theory of retrieval. Different applications of relevance weighting are illustrated by experimental results for test collections."

Utilized is the well-known probabilistic model of a two-class, discrete-measurement pattern environment (no Gaussian or statistical independence assumptions are made). The minimum-error recognition rule (Bayes) is used, with the unknown pattern environment probabilities estimated from the data relative frequencies. In calculating the mean accuracy over all such environments, only three parameters remain in the final equation: n, m , and the prior probability p_{c} of either of the pattern classes. With a fixed design pattern sample, recognition accuracy can first increase as the number of measurements made on a pattern increases, but decay with measurement complexity higher than some optimum value. Graphs of the mean accuracy exhibit both an optimal and a maximum acceptable value of n for fixed m and p_{c} . A four-place tabulation of the optimum n and maximum mean accuracy values is given for equally likely classes and m ranging from 2 to 1000 . The penalty exacted for the generality of the analysis is the use of the mean accuracy itself as a recognizer optimality criterion. Namely, one necessarily always has some particular recognition problem at hand whose Bayes accuracy will be higher or lower than the mean over all recognition problems having fixed n, m , and p_{c} ."

The relevant computing procedures are published in the Algorithm section of the same issue of Applied Statistics. The use of the MST in the interpretation of vector diagrams arising in multivariate analysis is illustrated by an example."

Execution time is proportional to the square of the number of nodes of the graph; a minimal spanning tree for a graph of 50 nodes is generated in 0.1 seconds on an IBM System 360/67. Previous algorithms [2, 3, 4, 5] require an amount of computation which depends on the graph topology and edge lengths and are best suited to graphs with few edges."
