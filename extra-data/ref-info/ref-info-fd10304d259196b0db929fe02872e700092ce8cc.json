If the features are not uniquely characterized by their local appearances, as is often the case in programmable assembly, the matching technique must base its decisions on the relative structure of the features. In this paper we describe a technique that uses the relative positions and orientations of the features to determine the correspondence between features of an object model and features observed in a picture. A graph is constructed in which maximal cliques (i.e., completely connected subgraphs) represent mutually consistent assignments of model features to observed features. The technique is a robust, general-purpose way to match structures. However, in practical applications its use is restricted to moderately sized graphs because the algorithm that locates maximal cliques is apparently exponential. For tasks that require the analysis of large graphs a few techniques are presented to reformulate them so that smaller graphs are sufficient."

The technique forms all possible pairs of image features and model features which match on the basis of local evidence alone. For each possible pair of matching features the parameters of an RST (rotation, scaling, and translation) transformation are derived. Clustering in the space of all possible RST parameter sets reveals a good global transformation which matches many image features to many model features. Results with a variety of data sets are presented which demonstrate that the technique does not require sophisticated feature detection and is robust with respect to changes of image orientation and content.

The matching is a specification of the geometrical disparity between the images and may be used to partially reconstruct the three-dimensional structure of the scene. Sets of candidate matching points are selected independently in each image. These points are the locations of small, distinct features which are likely to be detectable in both images. An initial network of possible matches between the two sets of candidates is constructed. Each possible match specifies a possible disparity of a candidate point in a selected reference image. An initial estimate of the probability of each possible disparity is made, based on the similarity of subimages surrounding the points. These estimates are iteratively improved by a relaxation labeling technique making use of the local continuity property of disparity that is a consequence of the continuity of real world surfaces. The algorithm is effective for binocular parallax, motion parallax, and object motion. It quickly converges to good estimates of disparity, which reflect the spatial organization of the scene."
