                "text": "The main factors limiting the performance of the peripheral parts of the visual system can be specified, and doing this clarifies the nature of the interpretive tasks that must be performed by the central parts of the system. It is argued that the critical factor that hinders development of better resolving power is the difficulty of confining light within the waveguide-like outer segment, and that for sensitivity this critical factor is the thermal decomposition of photosensitive pigments. Knowledge of these limits makes many surprising details of the eye intelligible. Understanding the difficulties posed by the narrow dynamic range of nerve fibres may give similar insight into the coding of the retinal image for transmission to the brain. Our level of understanding changes when we come to the visual cortex, for although we do not lack good anatomical and neurophysiological data, these do not make the principles of operation self-evident in the way that the structure of the eye immediately suggests that it is an image-forming device. The cortex converts the representation of the visual field that it receives into reliable knowledge of the world around us, and the trouble may be that we lack good models of how this can be done. A system that can respond to single quanta and resolve almost to the diffraction limit is unlikely to employ grossly inefficient methods for those higher functions upon which its whole utility depends, and so it is worth seeking out the limiting factors. The quality of human performance at certain higher perceptual tasks is high compared with the limit of reliable statistical inference; hence much of the sample of information available in a visual image must be effectively utilized. But there are strong limitations on the connectivity in the cortex, so that one is forced to consider how the relevant information can be collected together. Three stages of dealing with the visual image are proposed: the improvement of the cortical map in primary visual cortex by processes analogous to spatial and temporal interpolation ; the detection of linking features in this map; and the concentration of this information by non-topographical mapping in adjacent visual areas."

The varied ways in which this information is presented in the eyes of vertebrates and invertebrates raise questions about the consequences of the function of optical structures for vision. The purpose of this chapter is to review the effects of optical filtering on eye function emphasizing such unresolved issues, for example, as the function of optical filtering in the eyes of animals with high (suprahuman) visual acuity. Aspects of optical filtering will be reviewed commencing with the physical basis of transparency of the ocular media. The effects of interference and absorption filters will be examined. Polarization filters, which are covered by Waterman (this volume, Part B), and visual pigments, which have been recently reviewed by several authors in the Handbook of Sensory Physiology Vol. VII/I and Hamdorf (this volume), will be omitted. Filtering that results from the spatial arrangements and the physical properties of the photoreceptor cells will also be discussed. The unifying nature of this topic lends itself to a consideration of these factors independent of phylogenetic classification, and for this reason examples will be drawn freely from both the vertebrates and invertebrates."

                "text": "1. The contrast sensitivity of the optomotor response of the fly Musca domestica was measured using a moving sinusoidal grating as the stimulus. In parallel experiments intracellular recordings were made from photoreceptors and first order visual interneurones to to determine their responses to the same threshold stimuli. Measurements of the spatial modulation transfer function for photoreceptors confirm that the optics of the eye were intact during recordings. 2. At the lowest intensity at which one can obtain an optomotor response, the photoreceptor signal is a train of discrete depolarizations, or bumps. With constant intensity stimuli, the temporal distribution of bumps followed the Poisson distribution with a mean rate of proportional to luminance. The mean bump rate at the threshold intensity for a behavioural response is 1.7 +/\u2010 0.7 s\u20101 (mean +/\u2010 S.D., n = 25). 3. Calibrations and the statistical properties of the bump train indicate that a bump represents one effective photon, implying that the bump : photon ratios are quantum capture efficiencies. 4. At low intensities the first order interneurones (the large monopolar cells or LMCs) show hyperpolarizing bumps each triggered by a receptor bump. Using a point source stimulus, centred in the field of view, the LMC bump rate is six times that in a single receptor viewing the same stimulus, as expected from the known projection of six receptor axons to each LMC. When using an extended stimulus (the grating), the bump rate is 18\u201020 times that in receptors. Comparison with earlier work suggests that this increased lateral summation of receptor inputs to LMCs only occurs at very low intensities. 5. In both receptor and LMCs the amplitudes and wave forms of bumps depend upon the position of a point source stimulus within the field of view. With the light in the periphery of the field the bumps are smaller and slower than when the light is in the centre. This difference in response suggests that spatial stimulation is brought about by lateral interactions, possibly between receptors. 6. At higher mean intensities the signal\u2010to\u2010noise ratios in receptors responding to the appropriate threshold stimuli increase with intensity. This is suggestive of a decrease in the extent of spatial and/or temporal summation in the optomotor pathway."

The reciprocal nature of these spatio-temporal interactions can be particularly clearly ap\u00ad preciated if the threshold contrast is determined for a grating target whose luminance perpendicular to the bars is given by where m is the contrast, v the spatial frequency, and \u0192 the temporal frequency of the target.

Such a pattern was set up as a display on a cathode-ray oscil\u00ad loscope and Figs. 1 and 2 show the results of threshold-contrast measurements made by the author (a well-corrected myope).

                "text": "THE DISCHARGES carried in the optic nerve fibers contain all the information which the central nervous system receives from the retina. A correct interpretation of discharge patterns therefore constitutes an important step in the analysis of visual events. Further, investigations of nervous activity arising in the eye reveal many aspects of the functional organization of the neural elements within the retina itself. Following studies of discharges in the optic nerve of the eel\u2019s eye by Adrian and Matthews (2,3), Hartline and his colleagues described the discharge pattern in the eye of the Limulus in a series of important and lucid papers (for a summary see 20). In the Limulus the relationship between the stimulus to the primary receptor cell and the nerve discharges proved relatively simple, apparently because the connection between sense cell and nerve fiber was a direct one. Thus, when stimulation is confined to one receptor the discharge in a single Limulus nerve fiber will provide a good indication of excitatory events which take place as a result of photochemical processes. Discharges last for the duration of illumination and their frequency is a measure of stimulus strength. Lately, however, it was shown by Hartline et al. (22) that inhibitory interactions may be revealed when several receptors are excited. On the whole, the Limulus preparation shows many features which are similar to other simple sense organs, for instance, stretch receptors. In the latter, however, instead of photochemical events, stretch-deformation acts as the adequate stimulus on sensory terminals and is translated into a characteristic discharge pattern. The discharge from the cold-blooded vertebrate retina (mainly frogs) proved much more complex. Hartline found three main types when recording from single optic nerve fibers: (i) \u201con\u201d discharges, similar to those in the Limulus, firing for the duration of the light stimulus, (ii) \u201coff\u201d discharges appearing when a light stimulus was withdrawn, and (iii) \u2018con-off\u201d discharges, a combination of the former two, with activity confined mainly to onset and cessation of illumination. The mammalian discharge patterns were studied in a number of species by Granit and his co-workers in the course of their extensive work on the physiology of the visual system (summaries in 13, 15). On the whole, they did not observe any fundamental differences between frog and mammalian discharge types (see later)."

Contrast\u2010matching between different spatial frequencies was performed correctly (especially at frequencies above 5 c/deg) despite the attenuation by optical and neural factors which cause large differences in contrast thresholds. 3. Contrast\u2010matching between single lines of different widths was also veridical, and was not limited by the spatial integration (Ricco's Law) present at threshold. Adaptation to gratings altered the appearance of lines, and this could be best understood in Fourier terms. 4. The generality of these results was shown by matching the contrast of pictures which had been filtered so that each contained a one octave band of spatial frequencies. 5. Within the limits imposed by threshold and resolution, contrast\u2010matching was largely independent of luminance and position on the retina. 6. Six out of eleven astigmatic observers showed considerable suprathreshold compensation for their orientation\u2010specific neural deficit in contrast sensitivity. 7. These results define a new property of vision: contrast constancy. It is argued that spatial frequency channels in the visual cortex are organized to compensate for earlier attenuation. This achieves a dramatic 'deblurring' of the image, and optimizes the clarity of vision."

                "text": "xThe ideas of information theory are at present stimulating many different areas of psychological inquiry. In providing techniques for quantifying situations which have hitherto been difficult or impossible to quantify, they suggest new and more precise ways of conceptualizing these situations (see Miller [12] for a general discussion and bibliography). Events ordered in time are particularly amenable to informational analysis; thus language sequences are being extensively studied, and other sequences, such as those of music, plainly invite research. In this paper I shall indicate some of the ways in which the concepts and techniques of information theory may clarify our understanding of visual perception. When we begin to consider perception as an information-handling process, it quickly becomes clear that much of the information received by any higher organism is redundant. Sensory events are highly interdependent in both space and time: if we know at a given moment the states of a limited number of receptors (i.e., whether they are firing or not firing), we can make better-than-chance inferences with respect to the prior and subsequent states of these receptors, and also with respect to the present, prior, and subsequent states of other receptors. The preceding statement, taken in its broadest im1 The experimental work for this study was performed as part of the United States Air Force Human Resources Research and Development Program.

In the present discussion, however, we shall restrict our attention to special types of lawfulness which may exist in space at a fixed time, and which seem particularly relevant to processes of visual perception."

The slope of curves relating the log increment threshold to log background luminance in cat retinal ganglion cells is affected by the area and duration of the test stimulus, as it is in human pyschophysical experiments. 2. Using large area, long duration stimuli the slopes average 0\u201082 and approach close to 1 (Weber's Law) in the steepest cases. Small stimuli gave an average of 0\u201053 for on\u2010centre units using brief stimuli, and 0\u201056 for off\u2010centre units, using long stimuli. Slopes under 0\u20105 (square root law) were not found over an extended range of luminances. 3. On individual units the slope was generally greater for larger and longer test stimulus, but no unit showed the full extent of change from slope of 0\u20105 to slope of 1. 4. The above differences hold for objective measures of quantum/spike ratio, as well as for thresholds either judged by ear or assessed by calculation. 5. The steeper slope of the curves for large area, long duration test stimuli compared with small, long duration stimuli, is associated with the increased effectiveness of antagonism from the surround at high backgrounds. This change may be less pronounced in off\u2010centre units, one of which (probably transient Y\u2010type) showed no difference of slope, and gave parallel area\u2010threshold curves at widely separated background luminances, confirming the importance of differential surround effectiveness in changing the slope of the curves. 6. In on\u2010centre units, the increased relative effectiveness of the surround is associated with the part of the raised background light that falls on the receptive field centre. 7. It is suggested that the variable surround functions as a zero\u2010offset control that sets the threshold excitation required for generating impulses, and that this is separate from gain\u2010setting adaptive mechanisms. This may be how ganglion cells maintain high incremental sensitivity in spite of a strong maintained excitatory drive that would otherwise cause compressive response non\u2010linearities."

With an \u201cedgeless\u201d flickering field, these amplitude sensitivity curves show a broad peak of maximum visual response, in the region from 10 to 20 cps at high photopic levels.

Steady background levels hyperpolarize the rods, and the rod responses become progressively smaller as background level is increased. In cones, higher background levels reduce the effectiveness of test flashes, so higher ranges of test intensities are required to elicit the full range of graded responses. When backgrounds are terminated, cones return rapidly, but rods return slowly to the dark potential level. The effects of backgrounds on both rods and cones can be observed at intensities that cause negligible bleaching as determined by retinal densitometry. During dark adaptation, changes are observed in the rods and cones that are similar to those produced by backgrounds. Receptor sensitivities, derived from these results, show that rods saturate, cones obey Weber's law, and sensitization during dark adaptation follows a two-phase time-course."

                "text": "A theory of edge detection is presented. The analysis proceeds in two parts. (1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of \u22072G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and \u22072 is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround \u22072G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr & Ullman 1979)."

                "text": "1. Intracellular recordings have been made from the blowfly (Calliphora erythrocephala) retinula cell; apart from the transducer mechanism, these cells also feature a pupil mechanism. 2. At several mean intensity levels, within the apparently linear range of response, frequency characteristics of amplitude and phase and responses to \u2018delta\u2019\u2010flashes and \u2018delta\u2019\u2010flash pairs have been obtained. 3. Fourier methods have shown these responses to be mutually compatible, confirming linearity in these circumstances. 4. Non\u2010linear behaviour can be made to appear at the lower frequencies when the modulation depth is increased. 5. Non\u2010linearities can also appear through application of the superposition test: a low frequency sine wave, modulated so as to elicit an apparently linear response, and a high frequence sine wave which does not give rise to non\u2010linearity even at the highest modulation depths can, when superimposed, yield a greater response to the latter when situated at the minima of the former than at its maxima. 6. At frequencies above approximately 1 Hz these superposition non\u2010linearities are attributed to the transducer mechanism gain control. Below this frequency the pupil mechanism takes part considerably in the retinula cell's total observed gain control: its characteristics remain yet to be cleared up. 7. The transducer's linear and non\u2010linear properties fit in closely with those of the Fuortes\u2010Hodgkin model which couples increases in gain and time constants. 8. The Fuortes\u2010Hodgkin model will probably require some quantitative modifications in the originally treated case of Limulus, on account of its pupil. 9. Finally, the merits of Veringa's diffusion model, and the possibility of eventually joining this model with the Fuortes\u2010Hodgkin one are pointed out briefly."

If the method used for prediction makes full use of the entire pertinent past, then the error signal \u2014 the difference between the actual and the predicted signal \u2014 will be a completely random wave of lower power than the original signal but containing all the information of the original. One method of prediction, which docs not make full use of the past, but which is nevertheless remarkably effective with certain signals and also appealing because of its relative simplicity, is linear prediction. Here the prediction for the next signal sample is simply the sum of previous signal samples each multiplied by an appropriate weighting factor. The best values for the weighting coefficients depend upon the statistics of the signal, but once they have been determined the prediction may be done with relatively simple apparatus. This paper describes the apparatus used for some experiments on linear prediction of television signals, and describes the results obtained to date."

A statistically self-organizing system is described in which not only normal homeostatic behaviour but also such activities as invention of fruitful hypotheses, imagination of fictitious situations, and like would find a natural place. Discussion is confined mainly to manner of concept-formation and concept-handling in such a system. It has been suggested that correlate of perception (as distinct from reception) is activity which organizes an outwardly directed internal matching response to signals from receptors. This organizing activity amounts logically to an internal representation of feature in incoming signals to which it is adaptive, i.e. feature which is thus \u2018perceived\u2019. \n \n \n \nA hierarchic structure is postulated wherein much of organizing activity is concerned with modifying probabilities of other activity. Abstract concepts and hypotheses are represented by \u2018sub-routines\u2019 of such organizing activity. These can in principle be evolved as a result of experience in a manner analogous to-or at least fruitfully comparable with-process of learning and discovery; and it is not necessary for designer to predetermine, nor possible for him to foresee, all conceptual categories in terms of which information received by system may be structured. Particular attention is directed to conditions under which such a process of concept-formation could take place with sufficient rapidity. \n \n \n \nSome of symptoms of psychopathology find apparent correlates in possible modes of malfunction of such a system.

Two methods are then discussed, whereby such messages can be converted to a \u201creduced\u201d form in which the successive samples are more nearly independent and for which the simple amplitude distribution is more peaked than in the original message. This reduced signal can then be encoded into binary digits with good efficiency using a Shannon-Fano code on a symbol-by-symbol (or pair-by-pair) basis. The usual inefficiency which results from ignoring the correlation between message segments is lessened because this correlation is less in the reduced message."
