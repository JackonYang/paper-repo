Talbot & Marshall (1941) used physiological methods to map the central part of the visual field on to the posterolateral surface ofthe cortex in the monkey. They devised an index of cortical representation expressed as the increment of the angle, measured radially from the centre of gaze, which is represented on each millimetre of cortex. We have confirmed their observations and have extended the mapping to the buried visual cortex in the horizontal and vertical calcarine fissures. We have preferred to use the reciprocal of their index and to call it the cortical magnification, M. When this is measured along radii and at right angles to them, it provides the empirical quantitative relation which Polyak wanted. It also defines the shape and size of the visual receptive field. We have made such a surface, folded it and compared it with the calcarine cortex of the monkey. A preliminary account of this work has been published (Daniel & Whitteridge, 1959)."

It would be astonishing if such a structure did not profoundly modify the response patterns of fibres coming into it. In the cat's visual cortex, the receptive field arrangements of single cells suggest that there is indeed a degree of complexity far exceeding anything yet seen at lower levels in the visual system. In a previous paper we described receptive fields of single cortical cells, observing responses to spots of light shone on one or both retinas (Hubel & Wiesel, 1959). In the present work this method is used to examine receptive fields of a more complex type (Part I) and to make additional observations on binocular interaction (Part II). This approach is necessary in order to understand the behaviour of individual cells, but it fails to deal with the problem of the relationship of one cell to its neighbours. In the past, the technique of recording evoked slow waves has been used with great success in studies of functional anatomy. It was employed by Talbot & Marshall (1941) and by Thompson, Woolsey & Talbot (1950) for mapping out the visual cortex in the rabbit, cat, and monkey. Daniel & Whitteiidge (1959) have recently extended this work in the primate. Most of our present knowledge of retinotopic projections, binocular overlap, and the second visual area is based on these investigations. Yet the method of evoked potentials is valuable mainly for detecting behaviour common to large populations of neighbouring cells; it cannot differentiate functionally between areas of cortex smaller than about 1 mm2. To overcome this difficulty a method has in recent years been developed for studying cells separately or in small groups during long micro-electrode penetrations through nervous tissue. Responses are correlated with cell location by reconstructing the electrode tracks from histological material. These techniques have been applied to"

The hypothesis is then formulated quantitatively, and shown to be able to account for the above experiment, and also the disagreement in the literature between those who believe that the absorption of two quanta can cause a sensation, and those who believe that 5 or more are required. The formulation of the hypothesis is used to calculate the maximum allowable noise (expressed as a number x of random, independent events confusable with the absorption of a quantum of light) in the optic pathway for the absorption of various fractions of the total number of quanta incident at the cornea."

                "text": "THE DISCHARGES carried in the optic nerve fibers contain all the information which the central nervous system receives from the retina. A correct interpretation of discharge patterns therefore constitutes an important step in the analysis of visual events. Further, investigations of nervous activity arising in the eye reveal many aspects of the functional organization of the neural elements within the retina itself. Following studies of discharges in the optic nerve of the eel\u2019s eye by Adrian and Matthews (2,3), Hartline and his colleagues described the discharge pattern in the eye of the Limulus in a series of important and lucid papers (for a summary see 20). In the Limulus the relationship between the stimulus to the primary receptor cell and the nerve discharges proved relatively simple, apparently because the connection between sense cell and nerve fiber was a direct one. Thus, when stimulation is confined to one receptor the discharge in a single Limulus nerve fiber will provide a good indication of excitatory events which take place as a result of photochemical processes. Discharges last for the duration of illumination and their frequency is a measure of stimulus strength. Lately, however, it was shown by Hartline et al. (22) that inhibitory interactions may be revealed when several receptors are excited. On the whole, the Limulus preparation shows many features which are similar to other simple sense organs, for instance, stretch receptors. In the latter, however, instead of photochemical events, stretch-deformation acts as the adequate stimulus on sensory terminals and is translated into a characteristic discharge pattern. The discharge from the cold-blooded vertebrate retina (mainly frogs) proved much more complex. Hartline found three main types when recording from single optic nerve fibers: (i) \u201con\u201d discharges, similar to those in the Limulus, firing for the duration of the light stimulus, (ii) \u201coff\u201d discharges appearing when a light stimulus was withdrawn, and (iii) \u2018con-off\u201d discharges, a combination of the former two, with activity confined mainly to onset and cessation of illumination. The mammalian discharge patterns were studied in a number of species by Granit and his co-workers in the course of their extensive work on the physiology of the visual system (summaries in 13, 15). On the whole, they did not observe any fundamental differences between frog and mammalian discharge types (see later)."

Our method is to find what sort of stimulus causes the largest activity in one nerve fiber and then what is the exciting aspect of that stimulus such that variations in everything else cause little change in the response. It has been known for the past 20 years that each fiber is connected not to a few rods and cones in the retina but to very many over a fair area. Our results show that for the most part within that area, it is not the light intensity itself but rather the pattern of local variation of intensity that is the exciting factor. There are four types of fibers, each type concerned with a different sort of pattern. Each type is uniformly distributed over the whole retina of the frog. Thus, there are four distinct parallel distributed channels whereby the frog's eye informs his brain about the visual image in terms of local pattern independent of average illumination. We describe the patterns and show the functional and anatomical separation of the channels. This work has been done on the frog, and our interpretation applies only to the frog."

The dimensions, and therefore the fields of view of the ommatidia are also related across the eye. In the relation between structure and function there are many points that invite discussion, but the intention is to order our knowledge so that the gaps become obvious. (2) The first step has been to make maps of the eyes showing the maximum theoretical resolving power of the facets and also the interommatidial angle, the reciprocal of which is the maximum spatial resolution of combinations of facets. The ratio of these two resolutions at each point shows the minimum overlap of the visual fields. These maps can be made from the outside of the eye; they show the main types of eye. (3) The next step is to work out the optics of individual ommatidia so that the focal lengths and receptor widths can be measured. The field width can then be predicted from the facet size and the subtense of the receptor at the posterior nodal point. The final step is to measure the field widths of individual ommatidia experimentally as a test of the optical theory, and to make maps of the actual fields in their correct position on the eye in angular coordinates. (4) Three examples of maps of actual fields are given, and their anatomical and diffraction components are separated. The maps are an essential step towards the electrophysiological analysis of the ganglia behind the eye. A theory of the origin of the fields in terms of anatomy and optics also opens the way to an analysis of mechanisms that change the field size upon adaptation to light. A comparative study of the fields in different eye regions and in different species can also be related to visual habits and behaviour."

Patterns of light stimuli most effective in influencing units at one level may no longer be the most effective at the next. From differences in responses at successive stages in the pathway one may hope to gain some understanding of the part each stage plays in visual perception. By shining small spots of light on the light-adapted cat retina Kuffler (1953) showed that ganglion cells have concentric receptive fields, with an 'on' centre and an 'off ' periphery, or vice versa. The 'on' and 'off' areas within a receptive field were found to be mutually antagonistic, and a spot restricted to the centre of the field was more effective than one covering the whole receptive field (Barlow, FitzHugh & Kuffler, 1957). In the freely moving lightadapted cat it was found that the great majority of cortical cells studied gave little or no response to light stimuli covering most of the animal's visual field, whereas small spots shone in a restricted retinal region often evoked brisk responses (Hubel, 1959). A moving spot of light often produced stronger responses than a stationary one, and sometimes a moving spot gave more activation for one direction than for the opposite. The present investigation, made in acute preparations, includes a study of receptive fields of cells in the cat's striate cortex. Receptive fields of the cells considered in this paper were divided into separate excitatory and inhibitory ('on' and 'off') areas. In this respect they resembled retinal ganglion-cell receptive fields. However, the shape and arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory areas differed strikingly from the concentric pattern found in retinal ganglion cells. An attempt was made to correlate responses to moving stimuli"

This cellular approach, along with new anatomical, physiological, and behavioral methods, has enabled the investigation of the machinery whereby the visual stimulus initiates motor movement. It is these advances that we concentrate on in this review. We emphasize the primate superior colliculus because most of the work relating to movement has been done in the rhesus monkey, Macaca mulatta. At the same time we draw on work done on the cat and tree shrew to supplement areas as yet unexplored in the monkey, although many interesting facets of work on these and other species are not considered. Other recent reviews have considered many of these other aspects (Sprague et al 1970, Gordon 1975, Sprague 1972,"

Kittens were dark\u2010reared until 4\u20106 weeks old, and then for another 4\u20107 weeks with various combinations of cylindrical lenses, monocular occlusion, and normal vision. 2. Single unit recordings from 816 neurones of the visual cortex (area 17) were obtained after the end of exposure. Clear\u2010cut effects on the distributions of the neurones' ocular dominance and orientation preference were found yielding close correlations with the rearing conditions. 3. It was confirmed that most cortical neurones prefer vertical stimulus orientations when experience is restricted to vertical contours in both eyes. It was further confirmed that, if the experienced orientations are different in the two eyes, each eye dominates over those neurones whose orientation preference corresponds to the orientation this eye has experienced. 4. When one eye is covered while the other sees only contours of one orientation, the ocular dominance distribution of cortical neurones shows a bias towards the open eye. Neurones dominated by this eye prefer orientations corresponding to the experienced range. Neurones preferring other orientations are shared between both eyes. 5. When vision is unimpaired in one eye and restricted to vertical contours in the other, binocularity is common among neurones preferring vertical orientations. Neurones with orientation preferences off the vertical are mainly monocular and dominated by the eye with unrestricted vision. 6. When normal monocular vision of one eye precedes restricted monocular vision of the other eye, only a few binocular units are encountered. Reversal of the initial effects of monocular experience is found only in neurones preferring the orientation that has been experienced by the newly opened eye. The other neurones remain dominated by the originally open eye. Thus, complementary distributions of orientation preferences are found for the two eyes. 7. A good correlation was found between the amount of orientational experience as determined by the number of orientations exposed and the number of normally tuned neurones. Conversely, the number of neurones responding to all orientations decreases with increasing amount of experience."

Four classes of striate neurones were defined: (a) non-activatable cells, (b) non-specific cells, (c) immature cells, (d) specific cells that are as selective for orientation as the simple or complex cells of the adult cat. The results confirm that as soon as neurones become visually activated, about 25% of the recorded visual units are definitely specific in terms of orientation selectivity. These neurones are present in earliest stages, even in the absence of any visual experience. However, active visual experience (visuomotor interaction) is necessary to maintain and develop these specific cells after the third week of postnatal life. Polar diagrams of the orientation encoded by specific cells show that for kittens under 3 weeks of age and whatever the rearing condition, there are more specific cells coding horizontal or vertical orientation than those coding oblique orientations. These horizontally and vertically oriented cells are preferentially driven by the contralateral eye. Thus, the ocular dominance distribution and the orientation selectivity appear as two linked parameters characterizing visual specificity in very young kittens independently of any visual experience. An hypothesis of \u201cdifferential modifiability\u201d is proposed: contralateral monocular \u201chorizontal and vertical detectors\u201d are supposed to be stable. They would remain so until they become binocular. Binocular cells, for which competition between two inputs occurs, are the labile units which can be despecified or be specified under the control of visual experience."

It occurs in a wide variety of vertebrates, including some which possess the porphyropsin system of freshwater fishes in place of the rhodopsin system of sea-water fishes and land vertebrates; but in spite of this widespread occurrence, there is no satisfactory explanation for the advantage derived from evolving different photosensitive systems with different spectral sensitivity curves for use at high and low levels of illumination. An explanation is not to be found in the different distribution of energy in the incident light in day-time and at night, for the maximum energy of light from the Moon is slightly to the red side of the maximum for light from the Sun. Le Grand1 suggests that rhodopsin was evolved by deep-sea fishes, for the light which penetrates deep into the sea has a maximum energy close to the peak of the absorption of rhodopsin, but a shift of the spectral sensitivity curve to the blue may enable the eye to achieve greater sensitivity for a quite different reason."

In Foundations of Cyclopean Perception (first published in 1971 and unavailable for years), Bela Julesz traced the visual information flow in the brain, analyzing how the brain combines separate images received from the two eyes to produce depth perception. Julesz developed novel tools to do this: random-dot stereograms and cinematograms, generated by early digital computers at Bell Labs. These images, when viewed with the special glasses that came with the book, revealed complex, three-dimensional surfaces; this mode of visual stimulus became a paradigm for research in vision and perception. This reprint edition includes all 48 color random-dot designs from the original, as well as the special 3-D glasses required to view them.Foundations of Cyclopean Perception has had a profound impact on the vision studies community. It was chosen as one of the one hundred most influential works in cognitive science in a poll conducted by the University of Minnesota's Center for Cognitive Sciences. Many copies are \"permanently borrowed\" from college libraries; used copies are sought after online. Now, with this facsimile of the 1971 edition, the book is available again to cognitive scientists, neuroscientists, vision researchers, artists, and designers."

Three types of acuity target\u2014vernier, fine line, and grating\u2014were observed for varying exposure durations under two viewing conditions. One was the \u201cstabilized image\u201d condition where a mirror on the eye was used to reflect the target beam in such a way as to stop the motion of the retinal image that would otherwise accompany the eye movements. The other viewing condition was optically the same except that the eye movements produced normal motions of the retinal image. Acuity was defined in terms of a minimum angle of resolution, i.e., the threshold value of the angle subtended by the critical dimension of the target. Acuity was found to improve with increasing exposure time up to about 0.2 sec under both viewing conditions. The main conclusion is that acuity is neither enhanced nor impaired by the involuntary eye movements that are present during the inspection of a test object."

At image speeds of less that 16 deg/s, temporal summation is as strong and as extended for moving as for stationary dots (total summation over to about 100 ms). This summation is about twice that which would be expected from separate consideration of the regions of spatial and temporal integration. Measurements with sinusoidal gratings reveal that the nature of the summation depends critically on the spatial frequency of the stimulus: gratings of low spatial frequency summate well when in motion (and only when in motion), whereas those of high spatial frequency summate well only when stationary or in very slow motion. An analogue simulation with electronic filters showed that these psychophysical results are directly predictable from the known transfer characteristics of the human visual system (with the additional assumption of probability summation at threshold). Finally, with small patches of sinusoidal grating, it was established that translation per se across the retina has little effect on temporal summation. This suggests that the results obtained with sinusoidal gratings of large extent are also relevant to small moving stimuli, allowing the summation results obtained with dot stimuli to be discussed in terms of the temporal transfer properties of spatially selective visual detectors. On the basis of these results it is proposed that the extended temporal summation observed for dots in motion results from summation of energy of low spatial frequency present in these stimuli."

For instance, vultures with eyes similar in size to those of man have a grating detectability of about twice the spatial frequency of man1. This is consistent with measured image quality in an eagle eye similar in size to the human eye2. Recently a falcon (Falco sparverius) has been shown to have a grating detectability 2.6 greater than that of man3. Although the image quality of these falconiform eyes is at least twice as good as man, their minimum intercone spacing is only slightly less than in the human retina. Unless the ratio of focal length to the axial eye length of these birds greatly exceeds that in man, falconiform eyes, unlike man, would be unable to resolve their best retinal image quality. We show here that the presence of a spherical depression in the deep fovea of falconiforms may act like the negative lens component in a telephoto lens system or opera glass. The focal length of the birds' dioptrics can then in theory exceed the axial length of the eye, thus providing the relatively large images necessary for more complete image reconstruction (high resolving power) in a localised region of the retina."

The term 'directionally selective' means that a unit gives a vigorous discharge of impulses when a stimulus object is moved through its receptive field in one direction (called the preferred direction), whereas motion in the reverse direction (called null) evokes little or no response. The preferred direction differs in different units, and the activity of a set of such units signals the direction of movement of objects in the visual field. In the rabbit the preferred and null directions cannot be predicted from a map of the receptive field showing the regions yielding on or off-responses to stationary spots. Furthermore, the preferred direction is unchanged by changing the stimulus; in particular, reversing the contrast of a spot or a black-white border does not reverse the preferred direction. Hubel & Wiesel (1962) thought that the directional selectivity of the cat's cortical neurons could be explained by the asymmetrical arrangement of on and off zones in the receptive field, and the simple interaction of effects summated over these zones, but the foregoing results rule out this explanation, at least in the rabbit's retina (Barlow & Hill, 1963). In the present paper we go on from this point to describe experiments which show, first, that directional selectivity is not due to optical aberrations of some kind and, secondly, that it is not a simple matter of the latency of response varying systematically across the receptive field. After these negative results we describe experiments upon the organization of directional selectivity within the receptive field, and upon its mechanism. These lead us to the conclusion that the ganglion cells responding to a"

Direct measurements of the minimum energy required for threshold vision under optimal physiological conditions yield values between 2.1 and 5.7 x 10\u201310 ergs at the cornea, which correspond to between 54 and 148 quanta of blue-green light. 2. These values are at the cornea. To yield physiologically significant data they must be corrected for corneal reflection, which is 4 per cent; for ocular media absorption, which is almost precisely 50 per cent; and for retinal transmission, which is at least 80 per cent. Retinal transmission is derived from previous direct measurements and from new comparisons between the percentage absorption spectrum of visual purple with the dim-vision luminosity function. With these three corrections, the range of 54 to 148 quanta at the cornea becomes as an upper limit 5 to 14 quanta actually absorbed by the retinal rods. 3. This small number of quanta, in comparison with the large number of rods (500) involved, precludes any significant two quantum absorptions per rod, and means that in order to produce a visual effect, one quantum must be absorbed by each of 5 to 14 rods in the retina. 4. Because this number of individual events is so small, it may be derived from an independent statistical study of the relation between the intensity of a light flash and the frequency with which it is seen. Such experiments give values of 5 to 8 for the number of critical events involved at the threshold of vision. Biological variation does not alter these numbers essentially, and the agreement between the values measured directly and those derived from statistical considerations is therefore significant. 5. The results clarify the nature of the fluctuations shown by an organism in response to a stimulus. The general assumption has been that the stimulus is constant and the organism variable. The present considerations show, however, that at the threshold it is the stimulus which is variable, and that the properties of its variation determine the fluctuations found between response and stimulus."

Injections of the enzyme were made through a recording micropipette, making it possible to localize the injection site by physiological criteria. We found that layer VI cells projected to the lateral geniculate nucleus, while a distinct population of cells in layer V projected to the superior colliculus. Cells in layers II and III were the major sources of ipsilateral cortico\u2010cortical connections. This pattern of projection was consistent from one visual area to another. Pyramidal cells appeared to be the source of cortico\u2010geniculate, cortico\u2010collicular and cortico\u2010cortical projections. The proportion of cells within a layer that terminated in a given site varied from layer to layer: apparently all of the large pyramids in layer V had terminals in the superior colliculus, about half of the pyramids in layer VI had terminals in the lateral geniculate nucleus, while only a small proportion of the pyramids in layers II and III had terminals in any single cortical area. The results indicated a remarkable specificity in the projections of the cortical layers."

Recordings were made from area 17 in two macaque monkeys three and four weeks of age, whose eyes had been closed near the time of birth. The first monkey was born normally, but one day elapsed before eye closure could be done. The second was delivered by Cesarean section and the lids sutured shut immediately. The results in these two animals were very similar; in both, highly ordered sequences of orientation shifts were present, and were in no obvious way different from those seen in the adult. For example, average values for the size of orientation shifts, for the horizontal component of the distance between shifts, and for the slopes of orientation vs. track distance curves, were all similar to adult values. This indicates that the ordered column system is innately determined and not the result of early visual experience. In these two monkeys and a third one, sutured at two days and examined at 38 days, most of the cells seemed normal by adult standards, with simple, complex or hypercomplex receptive fields, showing about the same range in orientation specificity as is found in adults. About 10\u201315% of cells showed abnormalities similar to those seen in monkeys binocularly deprived of vision for longer periods. Furthermore, all three deprived monkeys showed a decided lack of cells that could be influenced from both eyes, whereas a normal three\u2010week\u2010old control animal seemed similar to the adult, with binocular cells comprising over half of the total population. A monkey deprived by binocular closure from the third to the seventh week also showed a diminution in number of binocularly influenced cells, suggesting that the deprivation from birth resulted in a deterioration of innate connections subserving binocular convergence. To be sure that the abnormalities in the deprived animals represented a deterioration of connections, we recorded from 23 cells in a normal two\u2010day\u2010old monkey: here the ocular dominance distribution of cells was about the same as in the adult, and the response characteristics of the cells were normal by adult standards."

The dendritic branching level of on-beta cells is nearer to the cell body; that of off-beta cells is about 10 \u03bcm further outwards. After horseradish peroxidase (HRP) injection into the lateral geniculate nucleus all beta cells were labelled. In this way it is shown that about 55% of all ganglion cells, irrespective of retinal topography, are beta cells. The spatial distribution of on- and off-beta cells was studied from the HRP-labelled material. On-beta cells form a lattice with regular inter-cell spacings ; off-beta cells are also regularly arrayed. The two lattices are superimposed independently of each other. Beta cells are commonly assumed to be associated with the resolution of fine detail in the cat visual system. The mosaic of beta cells imposes some constraints and permits some predictions to be made with respect to the cat\u2019s visual discrimination."

This was examined in a further series of experiments, in which a visual alignment technique was used to measure the perceived visual direction of an apparently moving target in intervals between its presentations. Results showed that the target has approximately the visual direction that it would have if it were moving continuously. This \u2018filling in\u2019 of apparent motion was shown to occur before the level of stereopsis. The possible influence of tracking eye movements is discussed."

If the illumination going to the eye is reduced, the apparent multiplication increases3, suggesting possibly that the effect is a function of sensory integration time or \u201cpersistence\u201d as it is affected by adaptation state of the eye2. Since the adaptation conditions of the two eyes are substantially independent4, it is interesting to ask what we should see if a stroboscopically moving target were viewed with a filter over one eye only, and the different numbers of apparent bars stereoscopically fused. In these conditions more bars should be signalled by the filtered than by the unfiltered eye, and it is not obvious what the fused percept will be."

Although the topography of the visual field representations in this region of cortex is more complex than that found in areas 17, 18, and 19, this region appears to contain four representations of the visual hemifield. The four cortical areas these visual field representations occupy have been labeled 20a, 20b, 21a, and 21b. These representations are not as precise as those found in areas 17, 18, and 19; the receptive fields in areas 20a, 20b, 21a, and 21b are larger and there is more scatter in receptive field location among adjacent cells. The upper visual hemifield is emphasized in all four of these areas, but the extent of the representation ranges from just the central 20\u00b0 found in area 21a to nearly the entire upper visual quadrant found in area 20b. The peak areal magnification factors found in these areas are all at least one order of magnitude less than those found in area 17. The visual field transformations from retina onto cortex in areas 20a, 20b, 21a, and 21b are similar to the types we found in other cortical visual areas, and the significance of these transformations for visual processing is discussed."

Impulse activity was recorded from neurons in fovea1 striate (A17) and prestriate (Al@ cortex of monkeys trained to fixate monocularly and binocularly by rewarding them for detecting an abrupt change in the intensity of a small luminous spot. During periods of fixation, single bright or dark narrow bars moving across a frontoparallel plane were presented at a series of different depths. 2. Nearly all cortical neurons studied received input from both eyes. Binocular neurons were classifiedLint two categories on the basis of their monocular responses: those that gave similar responses to stimulation of right and left eye (ocular balance) and those that gave different responses (ocular unbalance). Different kinds of binocular interactions were observed. 3. Most neurons (84%) were sensitive to location of the stimulus in depth. Four types of depth-sensitive cells were recognized: a) tuned excitatory neurons, the most common type, that gave excitatory responses over a narrow range of depth about the fixation distance often with inhibitory flanks nearer and farther, and that typically received a balanced binocular input; b) tuned inhibitory neurons whose responses were largely suppressed by stimuli at or close to the plane of fixation; c) near neurons, which responded well to stimuli in front of the fixation plane and were suppressed by those behind it; d) far neurons, the opposite of near neurons. The last three types of depth cells were usually ocularly unbalanced. Peaks and steps of depthsensitivity profiles occurred at or close to the fixation distance (within t 0.4O of disparity), whereas the total range of binocular interaction, even for a single cell, could extend to more than t lo of disparity. 4.

The filter-induced depth effect persisted until a certain degree of intermittency in the presentations of the target was reached, and then it broke down. The degree of intermittency that could be tolerated before the depth effect broke down increased with the density of the filter. It could be argued that the filter determined a shift in the pairing of successive inputs to the eyes, such that the target position in the unfiltered eye was fused with the preceding target position in the filtered eye. However, it appears that the shifted-pairing effect cannot account for the depth impression seen when the target intermittency is less than about 30 ms. Below this value of intermittency a filter can produce a depth effect even when the delay it introduces is small in comparison to the intermittency of the input. The depth effect seen with intermittencies less than 30 ms appears to be of the same magnitude as that obtained with stimuli in continuous motion. It is concluded that a filter can cause two different kinds of depth shift with apparently moving stimuli."

In the present study small lesions were made in single layers or pairs of layers in the lateral geniculate body, and the striate cortex was later examined with a Fink\u2010Heimer modification of the Nauta method.

During dim illumination the membrane current showed pronounced fluctuations. 2. Amplitude histograms of responses to dim flashes of fixed intensity exhibited two discrete peaks, one at 0 pA and one near 1 pA, suggesting that the response was quantized. By setting a criterion amplitude level, flash responses could be classed as 'failures' (no response) or as 'successes' (at least one quantal event). 3. The variation of fraction of successes with flash intensity was consistent with the hypothesis that each quantal electrical event resulted from a single photoisomerization. 4. The quantal event had a mean amplitude of about 1 pA (5% of the standing dark current) and a standard deviation of 0.2 pA. Dispersion in the event amplitude prevented identification of histogram peaks corresponding to two or more photoisomerizations. 5. Individual quantal responses exhibited a smooth shape very similar to that of the average quantal response. This suggests that a single photoisomerization releases many particles of transmitter and that radial diffusion of internal transmitter is not a major source of delay in the light response. 6. The 'quantum efficiency' with which an absorbed photon generated an electrical event was measured as 0.5 +/\u2010 0.1 (S.E. of mean, n = 4). This is slightly lower than the quantum efficiency of photoisomerization obtained previously for rhodopsin in solution. 7. At wavelengths between 420 and 700 nm the quantal event was invariant in size, although the cell's sensitivity varied over a range of 10(5). 8. The power spectrum of the fluctuations in dim steady light was predicted by assuming that a random series of quantal events occurred independently. 9. In brighter light the fluctuations were faster, and the response to an incremental flash was reduced in size and duration. The power spectrum could be predicted by assuming random superposition of events with the shape of the incremental flash response."

It has generally been assumed that the optical system involved is similar to that in nocturnal insects, that is, the superposition mechanism of Exner2. The essential feature of Exner's theory is that the optical apparatus of the cornea and crystalline cone refracts light through twice the angle at which it was incident on the cornea (Fig. 1a). Light from many facets then combines to form a single image on the receptor layer, and if this is backed by a tapetum the light is reflected out through the same facets that it entered, causing the glow. There is now no doubt that Exner's mechanism is present in some insects3. Recent accounts have, however, cast doubt on whether it occurs in Crustacea4,5. This is largely because the high refractive indices and inhomogeneities required of the optical components have been shown not to be present. In this paper I show that superposition images are formed in the eyes of a midwater shrimp, but in a different. manner (Fig. 1b)."

In the honeybee the performance of the ommatidia must approach the theoretical limit set by diffraction if the whole eye resolves points separated by twice the inter-ommatidial angle.\n\n2. The eyes of twenty-seven other species of Hymenoptera were measured, and the results show that in eyes of different sizes the number of ommatidia is adjusted so that inter-ommatidial angle is just below the limiting resolving power of the ommatidia; this is the condition for optimum acuity in a compound apposition eye.\n\n3. When this condition is fulfilled the minimum resolvable angle is inversely proportional to the square root of the linear dimensions of the eye. Acuity increases with size more rapidly in the simple type of eye."

Contrast sensitivity measurements made using moving sinusoidal gratings were used to construct spatial\u2010frequency tuning curves. 2. In young kittens cells had low sensitivities, responded only to low spatial frequencies and were unselective for spatial frequency. In addition 30% of the cells recorded in the youngest kittens were unresponsive to visual stimuli. 3. Sensitivity improved to near\u2010adult values within 5\u20106 weeks. 4. Best spatial frequency improved more gradually, so that even in the oldest kittens best spatial frequencies were lower than adult values. 5. Selectivity for spatial frequency, considered both in terms of the numbers of selective cells and the narrowness of their tuning curves, improved rapidly, and reached adult values within the first 6 weeks. 6.

The scatter of centre sizes at one retinal location was measured by recording as many ganglion cells as possible in one cat in a small field of retina. The centre sizes of the individual classes were homogeneous and exhibited only a small amount of scatter. 4. The coverage of the retina by the different ganglion cell classes was assessed from their density and their receptive field centre area. At every retinal location the receptive field centres of seven to twenty brisk\u2010sustained (X) cells and of three to six brisk\u2010transient (Y) cells were found to overlap.

The projections from a single cortical locus are segregated into several patches of labeled terminals in layers III\u2013IV, which from bands in consecutive sections. Fields of distribution of these bands from two sites of area 17 may completely overlap, when they arise from neighboring regions, or may partially overlap, when they arise from more separated regions. The latter show a retinotopical order in these connections and, consequently, of area STS itself: central visual field is lateral and ventral in STS to peripheral visual field, and upper visual field is ventral and medial to lower visual field. Connections from area 17 to area MT in owl monkey were analyzed in a comparative study. Results show that these connections are also highly segregated into bands, and that those arising in separate, but neighboring regions of 17, may greatly overlap in MT. The retinotopy of these connections was not studied, however. The similar divergent distribution of area 17 connections to STS and MT, and the similarity of the topography of STS connections and of the known retinotopy of area MT, are considered as elements of homologies between these areas. Functional implications of these divergent patterns of connections to these motion\u2010sensitive areas (Zeki, '74), are considered."

The technique is based on information contained in outlines of histological sections, and it allows an entire hemisphere to be represented on a single cortical map. Maps for different hemispheres from individuals of the same species are similar in size, shape, and organization, and their configuration is largely independent of the plane of sectioning used for reconstruction. Many types of information pertaining to the location and organization of different functional subdivisions can be displayed on cortical maps; representative applications of the technique to mapping cerebral cortex in the macaque and the cat are shown. Areal measurements on cortical maps correspond closely (generally within 20%) to actual surface areas in the intact hemisphere. Therefore, the maps can also be used to provide accurate determinations of the absolute and relative extent of various anatomical and functional subdivisions of the cortex."

Here we report that similar electrical events occasionally occur in darkness, perhaps because of thermal isomerisation of rhodopsin."

The coupling between fibers of an array made up of n identical fibers each at the vertex of a polygon and one at the center, which is not necessarily the same as its n neighbors, is determined. Examples of this array are two fibers, three fibers in a row, and a hexagonal array with a fiber in the center. Very simple expressions for the coupling coefficients are presented. Mode coupling on a lossy fiber is investigated and a simple expression for the loss of a HE11 mode is given."
