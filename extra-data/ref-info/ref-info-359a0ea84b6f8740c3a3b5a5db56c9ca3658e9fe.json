Several critical functions have been investigated and the technical approaches are discussed. The first is the segmentation and classification of digitized printed documents into regions of text and images. A nonlinear, run-length smoothing algorithm has been used for this purpose. By using the regular features of text lines, a linear adaptive classification scheme discriminates text regions from others. The second technique studied is an adaptive approach to the recognition of the hundreds of font styles and sizes that can occur on printed documents. A preclassifier is constructed during the input process and used to speed up a well-known pattern-matching method for clustering characters from an arbitrary print source into a small sample of prototypes. Experimental results are included."

These rules involve sets of partially redundant features each of which defines an area of feature space which represents a \"vote\" for an object. Convergent evidence from multiple interpretation strategies is organized by top-down control mechanisms in the context of a partial interpretation. One such strategy extends a kernel interpretation derived through the selection of object exemplars, which represent the most reliable image specific hypotheses of a general object class, resulting in the extension of partial interpretations from islands of reliability."

This research investigates the use of a rule-based system for the control of image processing and interpretation of results with respect to a world model, as well as the representation of the world model within an image/map database. We present results on the interpretation of a high-resolution airport scene wvhere the image segmentation has been performed by a human, and by a region-based image segmentation program. The results of the system's analysis is characterized by the labeling of individual regions in the image and the collection of these regions into consistent interpretations of the major components of an airport model. These interpretations are ranked on the basis of their overall spatial and structural consistency. Some evaluations based on the results from three evolutionary versions of SPAM are presented."

This paper presents a new solution to the image segmentation problem that is based on the design of a rule-based expert system. General knowledge about low level properties of processes employ the rules to segment the image into uniform regions and connected lines. In addition to the knowledge rules, a set of control rules are also employed. These include metarules that embody inferences about the order in which the knowledge rules are matched. They also incorporate focus of attention rules that determine the path of processing within the image. Furthermore, an additional set of higher level rules dynamically alters the processing strategy. This paper discusses the structure and content of the knowledge and control rules for image segmentation."
