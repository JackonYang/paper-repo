Regions and their relations in an image are represented with region adjacency graph (RAG), which is a kind of attributed planar graph. The problem to find an optimal region correspondence, which matches the regions in two images with maximal similarity in region features and region relations, is formulated into the problem to find the optimal inexact matching between two RAGs. The properties specific to planar graph and that of the region adjacency relations are utilized to invent an efficient algorithm to solve the problem.

                "text": "This paper investigates graph rewriting as a tool for high-level recognition of two-dimensional mathematical notation. \"High-level recognition\" is the process of determining the meaning of a diagram from the output of a symbol recognizer. Characteristic problems of high-level mathematics recognition include: determining the groupings of symbols into recursive subexpressions and resolving ambiguities that depend upon global context. Our graph-rewriting approach uses knowledge of the notational conventions of mathematics, such as operator precedence and operator range, more effectively than syntactic or previous structural methods. Graph rewriting offers a flexible formalism with a strong theoretical foundation for manipulating two-dimensional patterns. It has been shown to be a useful technique for high-level recognition of circuit diagrams and musical scores. By demonstrating a graph-rewriting strategy for mathematics recognition, this paper provides further evidence for graph rewriting as a general tool for diagram recognition, and identifies some of the issues that must be considered as this potential is explored."

It presents, at one end, fundamental concepts and notations developed in syntactic and structural pattern recognition and at the other, reports on the current state of the art with respect to both methodology and applications. In particular, it includes artificial intelligence related techniques, which are likely to become very important in future pattern recognition.The book consists of individual chapters written by different authors. The chapters are grouped into broader subject areas like \u201cSyntactic Representation and Parsing\u201d, \u201cStructural Representation and Matching\u201d, \u201cLearning\u201d, etc. Each chapter is a self-contained presentation of one particular topic. In order to keep the original flavor of each contribution, no efforts were undertaken to unify the different chapters with respect to notation. Naturally, the self-containedness of the individual chapters results in some redundancy. However, we believe that this handicap is compensated by the fact that each contribution can be read individually without prior study of the preceding chapters. A unification of the spectrum of material covered by the individual chapters is provided by the subject and author index included at the end of the book."

It can be a challenge to relate the notation and formalism used by Wald to those more commonly used in the literature, but it is worth the effort if you are interested in the mathematical subtleties.

The method consists of extracting local image structures and matching similar such structures between two images. Linear edge segments are extracted from both the left and right images. Each segment is characterized by its position and orientation in the image as well as its relationships with the nearby segments. A relational graph is thus built from each image. For each segment in one image as set of potential assignments is represented as a set of nodes in a correspondence graph. Arcs in the graph represent compatible assignments established on the basis of segment relationships. Stereo matching becomes equivalent to searching for sets of mutually compatible nodes in this graph. Sets are found by looking for maximal cliques. The maximal clique best suited to represent a stereo correspondence is selected using a benefit function. Numerous results obtained with this method are shown. >"
