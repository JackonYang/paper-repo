In particular, its effectiveness in smoothing noise and its behavior with edges are characterized and compared with those of the two-dimensional median filter.

The main idea of the algorithm is to facilitate diffusion of the image in the direction parallel to color edges. The direction of maximal and minimal color change at each point is computed using the first fundamental form of the image in (L*a*b*) color space. The image (Phi) evolves according to an anisotropic diffusion flow given by (delta) (Phi) /(delta) t equals g((lambda) +, (lambda) -)(delta) 2(Phi) /(delta) (xi) 2, where (xi) is the direction of minimal color change. The diffusion coefficient, g((lambda) +, (lambda) -), is a function of the eigenvalues of the first fundamental form, which represent the maximal and minimal rates of color change. Examples for real color images are presented."

These algorithms are nonrecursive and do not require the use of any kind of transform. They share the same characteristics in that each pixel is processed independently. Consequently, this approach has an obvious advantage when used in real-time digital image processing applications and where a parallel processor can be used. For both the additive and multiplicative cases, the a priori mean and variance of each pixel is derived from its local mean and variance. Then, the minimum mean-square error estimator in its simplest form is applied to obtain the noise filtering algorithms. For multiplicative noise a statistical optimal linear approximation is made. Experimental results show that such an assumption yields a very effective filtering algorithm. Examples on images containing 256 \u00d7 256 pixels are given. Results show that in most cases the techniques developed in this paper are readily adaptable to real-time image processing."

The diffusion coefficient is chosen to vary spatially in such a way as to encourage intraregion smoothing rather than interregion smoothing. It is shown that the 'no new maxima should be generated at coarse scales' property of conventional scale space is preserved. As the region boundaries in the approach remain sharp, a high-quality edge detector which successfully exploits global information is obtained. Experimental results are shown on a number of images. Parallel hardware implementations are made feasible because the algorithm involves elementary, local operations replicated over the image. >"

Furthermore, WM filters belong to the broad class of nonlinear filters called stack filters. This enables the use of the tools developed for the latter class in characterizing and analyzing the behavior and properties of WM filters, e.g. noise attenuation capability. The fact that WM filters are threshold functions allows the use of neural network training methods to obtain adaptive WM filters. In this tutorial paper we trace the development of the theory of WM filtering from its beginnings in the median filter to the recently developed theory of optimal weighted median filtering. Applications discussed include: idempotent weighted median filters for speech processing, adaptive weighted median and optimal weighted median filters for image and image sequence restoration, weighted medians as robust predictors in DPCM coding and Quincunx coding, and weighted median filters in scan rate conversion in normal TV and HDTV systems."

This ability of the human observer suggests that completely automatic operation might at least partially separate noise and picture. A nonstationary, nonlinear operation has been found which selectively removes moderate amounts of additive Gaussian noise from a received picture signal. Running tests are performed upon the signal to detect the presence of perceptually significant picture detail in a number of different categories. Depending upon the test results, a selection is made from a number of available smoothing filter modes to maximize the suppression of noise without picture blurring. No preparatory operation is required at the transmitter, so that the technique is compatible with existing picture transmission systems. The process is applicable to conventional broadcast television, and could in principle be incorporated in home receivers to improve reception in fringe areas."
