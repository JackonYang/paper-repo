The role of this paper is to show that Boolean algebra can be instrumental in taking economic decisions.By a pseudo-Boolean function, a real-valued function with bivalent (0\u20131) variables will be understood. The symbols 0 and 1 will stay both for their logical meaning and their arithmetical value.The basic problems which arise frequently in connection with pseudo-Boolean functions are: (1) solution of systems of equations and/or inequalities involving only pseudo-Boolean functions, (2) problems of determining the maximum or the minimum of a free pseudo-Boolean function, or of a pseudo-Boolean function whose variables are subject to constraints; (3) problems of finding the minimax or the maximin of a pseudo-Boolean function.The basic problems outlined above are exemplified on the case of a company wishing to locate a number of service stations, which - under different assumptions - lead to the above formulated models."

It has a unique expression as a multilinear polynomial in n variables. It is called almost-positive if all the coefficients in that expression, except maybe those in the linear part, are nonnegative. The almost-positive functions form a convex cone, given explicitly by its extreme rays. Here we describe this cone by a system of linear inequalities, which can be viewed as a natural generalization of supermodularity to higher orders. We also point out a characterization in terms of the sign of partial derivatives."

                "text": "This paper studies the approximation of pseudo-Boolean functions by linear functions and more generally by functions of (at most) a specified degree. Here a pseudo-Boolean function means a real valued function defined on {0,1}n, and its degree is that of the unique multilinear polynomial that expresses it; linear functions are those of degree at most one. The approximation consists in choosing among all linear functions the one which is closest to a given function, where distance is measured by the Euclidean metric onR2n. A characterization of the best linear approximation is obtained in terms of the average value of the function and its first derivatives. This leads to an explicit formula for computing the approximation from the polynomial expression of the given function. These results are later generalized to handle approximations of higher degrees, and further results are obtained regarding the interaction of approximations of different degrees. For the linear case, a certain constrained version of the approximation problem is also studied. Special attention is given to some important properties of pseudo-Boolean functions and the extent to which they are preserved in the approximation. A separate section points out the relevance of linear approximations to game theory and shows that the well known Banzhaf power index and Shapley value are obtained as best linear approximations of the game (each in a suitably defined sense).ZusammenfassungIn dieser Arbeit wird die Approximation Pseudo-Boole'scher Funktionen lineare Funktionen bzw. allgemeiner durch Funktion kleiner/gleich eines festen Grades studiert. Dabei ist eine Pseudo-Boole'sche Funktion eine reellwertige Funktion definiert auf {0,1}n und ihr Grad ist jener des eindeutig bestimmten multilinearen Polynoms, durch die sie dargestellt werden kann. Lineare Funktionen sind jene mit einem Grad kleiner oder gleich Eins. Die Approximation besteht darin, da\u00df unter allen linearen Funktionen jene mit dem kleinsten Euklidischen Abstand inR2n gew\u00e4hlt wird. Es wird eine Charakterisierung der besten linearen Approximation durch den Mittelwert der Funktion und ihrer ersten Ableitungen angegeben. Sie f\u00fchrt auf eine explizite Formel, um die Approximation aus der Polynomform gegebenen Funktion zu berechnen. Diese Ergebnisse werden sp\u00e4ter verallgemeinert, um Approximationen h\u00f6heren Grades zu behandeln. Ferner werden Ergebnisse bez\u00fcglich des Zusammenhanges von Approximationen verschiedenen Grades gewonnen. Im linearen Fall wird auch eine im gewissen Sinne eingeschr\u00e4nkte Approximationsaufgabe behandelt. Spezielle Betrachtung wird jenen wichtigen Eigenschaften Pseudo-Boole'scher Funktionen gezollt, die bei der Approximation erhalten bleiben. Ein weiterer Abschnitt zeigt die Relevanz linearer Approximationen in der Spieltheorie auf und zeigt Verbindungen zwischen den hier erzielten Ergebnissen und dem wohlbekannten Banzhaf Index auf."

These algorithms construct a sequence of neighbouring (Hamming distance 1) vertices with decreasing f-value. The question arises as to when such algorithms will find the global optimum given any starting point. This paper describes a hierarchy of such classes of functions that are shown to strictly contain each other. These classes are, in increasing order of generality, the threshold, the saddle-free, the pseudomodular, the completely unimodal, the unimodal, and the unimin (respectively, unimax) functions. Some considerations as to the complexity of the above-mentioned class of algorithms are also made."

Last, the connection between cliques and efficient multi-prover interaction proofs, is shown to yield hardness results on the complexity of approximating the size of the largest clique in a graph.\nOf independent interest is our proof of correctness for the multilinearity test of functions."

A key step in this method is a simple observation which limits the search space to a finite one. Using this new method they present a number of new, computer-constructed gadgets for several different reductions. This method also answers the question of how to prove the optimality of gadgets-they show how LP duality gives such proofs. The new gadgets improve hardness results for MAX CUT and MAX DICUT, showing that approximating these problems to within factors of 60/61 and 44/45 respectively is NP-hard (improving upon the previous hardness of 71/72 for both problems). They also use the gadgets to obtain an improved approximation algorithm for MAX 3SAT which guarantees an approximation ratio of 0.801, This improves upon the previous best bound of 0.7704."

The resulting algorithm runs in time bounded by a polyno- mial in the size of the underlying set and the length of the largest absolute function value.

The model accurately predicts the behavior of the algorithms, and allows for a variety of probabilistic assumptions that permit degeneracy. Simulation indicates an approximately linear average number of iterations under a variety of probability assumptions. We derive theoretical bounds of 2en logn and en2 for different distributions, respectively, as well as polynomial bounds for a broad class of probability distributions. We conclude with a discussion of the applications of the model to LCP and linear programming."

Since the difficulty of mixed integer programming problems often depends more strongly on the number of integer variables than on the number of continuous variables, such rules are expected to have advantages in practical applications. In addition, the continuous variables automatically receive integer values, and hence our formulation can also be exploited by methods designed to take advantage of a pure integer structure."

We show that QPn has a diameter of one, descriptively identify three families of facets of QPn and show that QPn is symmetric in the sense that all facets of QPn can be obtained from those that contain the origin by way of a mapping. The naive linear programming relaxation QPnLP of QPn is shown to possess the Trubin-property and its extreme points are shown to be {0,1/2,1}-valued. Furthermore, O(n3) facet-defining inequalities of QPn suffice to cut off all fractional vertices of QPnLP, whereas the family of facets described by us has at least O(3n) members. The problem is also studied for sparse quadratic forms (i.e. when several or many coefficients are zero) and conditions are given for the previous results to carry over to this case. Polynomially solvable problem instances are discussed and it is shown that the known polynomiality result for the maximization of nonnegative quadratic forms can be obtained by simply rounding the solution to the linear programming relaxation. In the case that the graph induced by the nonzero coefficients of the quadratic form is series-parallel, a complete linear description of the associated Boolean quadric polytope is given. The relationship of the Boolean quadric polytope associated to sparse quadratic forms with the vertex-packing polytope is discussed as well."

First, the Dantzig property of transportation matrices is shown to hold for a more general class of matrices arising in connection with adjacent integer solutions to P\u2032. Next, we show that, for every feasible integer basis to P\u2032, there are at least as many adjacent feasible integer bases as there are nonbasic columns. Finally, given any two basic feasible integer solutions x1 and x2 to P\u2032, x2 can be obtained from x1 by a sequence of p pivots (where p is the number of indices j \u03f5 N for which xj1 is nonbasic and xj2 = 1), such that each solution in the associated sequence is feasible and integer. Some of our results have been conjectured earlier by Andrew, Hoffmann, and Krabek in a paper presented to ORSA in 1968."

In the weighted version of this problem there are given real weights on the edges ofG, and the objective is to maximize the sum of the weights of the edges having exactly one endpoint in the subsetS. In this paper, we consider the maximum cut problem and some related problems, likemaximum-2-satisfiability, weighted signed graph balancing. We describe the relation of these problems to the unconstrained quadratic 0\u20131 programming problem, and we survey the known methods for lower and upper bounds to this optimization problem. We also give the relation between the related polyhedra, and we describe some of the known and some new classes of facets for them."

In [4] several equivalent polynomially solvable relaxations are described whose common optimal value, w, yields an upper bound of f*, the zero-one maximum of f(x). One of these relaxations is the maximization of a piecewise linear concave function, R(x), over the full unit hypercube. Using this relaxation we obtain a bound on (w\u2212f*). In the special case where the off-diagonal elements of the Hessian matrix are nonnegative, we show that R(x) coincides with the concave envelope."

In this paper we investigate the problem of optimal compression of propositional Horn production rule knowledge bases. The standard approach to this problem, consisting in the removal of redundant rules from a knowledge base, leads to an \"irredundant\" but not necessarily optimal knowledge base. We prove here that the number of rules in any irredundant Horn knowledge base involving n propositional variables is at most n 0 1 times the minimum possible number of rules. In order to formalize the optimal compression problem, we define a Boolean function of a knowledge base as being the function whose set of true points is the set of models of the knowledge base. In this way the optimal compression of production rule knowledge bases becomes a problem of Boolean function minimization. In this paper we prove that the minimization of Horn functions (i.e. Boolean functions associated to Horn knowledge bases) is..."

In general, these algorithms display two characteristics: speed and inaccuracy. This behavior is correctly predicted by our model: we show that the expected number of iterations is linear for a wide range of randomness assumptions, and that the number of local optima tends to be exponentially large. We also give some results and constructions that suggest that known NP-complete problems cannot be solved even probabilistically by any \u201creasonable\u201d local improvement method."

By rewriting the quadratic minimization problem as a balancing problem in a weighted signed graph, it can be seen that the polyhedron defined by the odd cycle inequalities is equivalent, in a certain sense, with ${\\text{S}}^{[3]} $. As a corollary, a compact linear programming formulation is presented for the maximum cut problem for the case of weakly bipartite graphs."

These experiences made me aware that seemingly simple discrete optimization problems could hold the seeds of combinatorial explosions. The work of Dantzig, Fulkerson, Hoffman, Edmonds, Lawler and other pioneers on network flows, matching and matroids acquainted me with the elegant and efficient algorithms that were sometimes possible. Jack Edmonds\u2019 papers and a few key discussions with him drew my attention to the crucial distinction between polynomial-time and superpolynomial-time solvability. I was also influenced by Jack\u2019s emphasis on min-max theorems as a tool for fast verification of optimal solutions, which foreshadowed Steve Cook\u2019s definition of the complexity class NP. Another influence was George Dantzig\u2019s suggestion that integer programming could serve as a universal format for combinatorial optimization problems."

                "text": "This paper continues the investigation of the connection between probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs) and the approximability of NP-optimization problems. The emphasis is on proving tight nonapproximability results via consideration of measures such as the \"free-bit complexity\" and the \"amortized free-bit complexity\" of proof systems. \nThe first part of the paper presents a collection of new proof systems based on a new error-correcting code called the long code. We provide a proof system that has amortized free-bit complexity of $2 + \\epsilon$, implying that approximating MaxClique within $N^{\\frac13-\\e}$, and approximating the Chromatic Number within $N^{\\frac15-\\e}$, are hard, assuming $\\NP\\neq\\coRP$, for any e > 0. We also derive the first explicit and reasonable constant hardness factors for Min Vertex Cover, $\\MSAT{2}$, and Max Cut, and we improve the hardness factor for $\\MSAT{3}$. We note that our nonapproximability factors for $\\maxsnp$ problems are appreciably close to the values known to be achievable by polynomial-time algorithms. Finally, we note a general approach to the derivation of strong nonapproximability results under which the problem reduces to the construction of certain \"gadgets.\" \nThe increasing strength of nonapproximability results obtained via the PCP connection motivates us to ask how far this can go and whether PCPs are inherent in any way. The second part of the paper addresses this. The main result is a \"reversal\" of the connection due to Feige et al. (FGLSS connection) [J. ACM, 43 (1996), pp. 268--292]: where the latter had shown how to translate proof systems for NP into NP-hardness of approximation results for MaxClique, we show how any NP-hardness of approximation result for MaxClique yields a proof system for NP. Roughly, our result says that for any constant f, if MaxClique is NP-hard to approximate within N 1(1+f), then $\\NP\\subseteq \\overline{\\fpcp}[\\log,f]$, the latter being the class of languages possessing proofs of logarithmic randomness and amortized free-bit complexity f. This suggests that PCPs are inherent to obtaining nonapproximability results. Furthermore, the tight relation suggests that reducing the amortized free-bit complexity is necessary for improving the nonapproximability results for MaxClique. \nThe third part of our paper initiates a systematic investigation of the properties of PCP and FPCP (free PCP) as a function of the following various parameters: randomness, query complexity, free-bit complexity, amortized free-bit complexity, proof size, etc. We are particularly interested in triviality results, which indicate which classes are not powerful enough to capture NP. We also distill the role of randomized reductions in this area and provide a variety of useful transformations between proof checking complexity classes."

The former problem comes up in solid-state physics, and the latter in very-large-scale-integrated VLSI circuit design and in printed circuit board design. Both problems can be reduced to the max-cut problem in graphs. Based on a partial characterization of the cut polytope, we design a cutting plane algorithm and report on computational experience with it. Our method has been used to solve max-cut problems on graphs with up to 1,600 nodes."

His algorithm makes nontrivial use of solutions to maximum flow problems. New, simple $\\frac{3}{4}$-approximation algorithms that apply the probabilistic method/randomized rounding to the solution to a linear programming relaxation of MAX SAT are presented. It is shown that although standard randomized rounding does not give a good approximate result, the best solution of the two given by randomized rounding and a well-known algorithm of Johnson is always within $\\frac{3}{4}$ of the optimal solution. It is further shown that an unusual twist on randomized rounding also yields $\\frac{3}{4}$-approximation algorithms. As a by-product of the analysis, a tight worst-case analysis of the relative duality gap of the linear programming relaxation is obtained."

In this paper, we show that two prover proof systems are also convenient starting points for establishing easiness of approximation results.

As a consequence of our approach, we present improved approximation algorithms for MAX 2SAT and MAX DICUT. The algorithms are guaranteed to deliver solutions within a factor of 0.931 of the optimum for MAX 2SAT and within a factor of 0.859 for MAX DICUT, improving upon the guarantees of 0.878 and 0.796 of Goemans and Williamson (1994).<<ETX>>"

If the instance-a collection of clauses each of length at most three-is satisfiable, then the expected weight of the assignment found is at least 7/8 of optimal. We provide strong evidence (but not a proof) that the algorithm performs equally well on arbitrary MAX 3SAT instances. Our algorithm uses semidefinite programming and may be seen as a sequel to the MAX CUT algorithm of Goemans and Williamson (1995) and the MAX 2SAT algorithm of Feige and Goemans (1995). Though the algorithm itself is fairly simple, its analysis is quite complicated as it involves the computation of volumes of spherical tetrahedra. Hastad has recently shown that, assuming P/spl ne/NP, no polynomial-time algorithm for MAX 3SAT can achieve a performance ratio exceeding 7/8, even when restricted to satisfiable instances of the problem. Our algorithm is therefore optimal in this sense. We also describe a method of obtaining direct semidefinite relaxations of any constraint satisfaction problem of the form MAX CSP(F), where F is a finite family of Boolean functions. Our relaxations are the strongest possible within a natural class of semidefinite relaxations."

Such a function is called submodular. We consider the problem maxS\u2282N{a(S):|S|\u2264K,z(S) submodular}.Several hard combinatorial optimization problems can be posed in this framework. For example, the problem of finding a maximum weight independent set in a matroid, when the elements of the matroid are colored and the elements of the independent set can have no more thanK colors, is in this class. The uncapacitated location problem is a special case of this matroid optimization problem.We analyze greedy and local improvement heuristics and a linear programming relaxation for this problem. Our results are worst case bounds on the quality of the approximations. For example, whenz(S) is nondecreasing andz(0) = 0, we show that a \u201cgreedy\u201d heuristic always produces a solution whose value is at least 1 \u2212[(K \u2212 1)/K]K times the optimal value. This bound can be achieved for eachK and has a limiting value of (e \u2212 1)/e, where e is the base of the natural logarithm."

In particular, we show that inequalities associated with chordless cycles define facets of this polytope; moreover, for these inequalities a polynomial algorithm to solve the separation problem is presented. We characterize the facet defining inequalities ofPC(G) ifG is not contractible toK5. We give a simple characterization of adjacency inPC(G) and prove that for complete graphs this polytope has diameter one and thatPC(G) has the Hirsch property. A relationship betweenPC(G) and the convex hull of incidence vectors of balancing edge sets of a signed graph is studied."

Some properties of this \u201cstandard\u201d concave extension are investigated. Polynomials for which the standard extension coincides with the concave envelope are characterized in terms of integrality of a certain polyhedron or balancedness of a certain matrix. The standard extension is proved to be identical to another type of concave extension, defined as the lower envelope of a class of affine functions majorizing the given polynomial."

The lower bound on the average greedy solution is at least $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the optimal, and this bound increases with the probability of the greedy heuristic selecting the optimal at each step. In the probabilistic greedy heuristic, probabilities are introduced into the search strategy so that a decrease in the probability of finding the optimal solution occurs only if the nonoptimal solution becomes closer to the optimal.

Four equivalent problems are discussed\u2014the primal, the \u2018complementation\u2019, the \u2018discrete Rhys LP\u2019 and the \u2018weighted stability problem of a SAM graph\u2019. Each of them has a relaxation\u2014the \u2018roof dual\u2019, the \u2018quadratic complementation,\u2019 the \u2018continuous Rhys LP\u2019 and the \u2018fractional weighted stability problem of a SAM graph\u2019. The main result is that the four gaps associated with the four relaxations are equal. Furthermore, a solution to any of these problems leads at once to solutions of the other three equivalent ones. The four relaxations can be solved in polynomial time by transforming them to a bipartite maximum flow problem. The optimal solutions of the \u2018roof-dual\u2019 define \u2018best\u2019 linear majorantsp(x) off, having the following persistency property: if theith coefficient inp is positive (negative) thenxi=1 (0) in every optimum of the primal problem. Several characterizations are given for the case where these persistency results cannot be used to fix any variable of the primal. On the other hand, a class of gap-free functions (properly including the supermodular ones) is exhibited."

Some of our results generalize previously known theorems concerning linear and quadratic knapsack problems. We investigate in particular the case in which the objective function is supermodular. Under this hypothesis, although the problem remains NP-hard, we show that its Lagrangean dual and its continuous relaxation can be solved in polynomial time. We also comment on the complexity of recognizing supermodular functions. The particular case in which the knapsack constraint is of the cardinality type is also addressed and some properties of its optimal value as a function of the right hand side are derived."

Problems of this kind arise in numerous economic, location decision, and strategic planning situations, including capital budgeting, facility location, quadratic assignment, media selection, and dynamic set covering. A new linearization technique is presented for this problem which is demonstrated to yield a tighter continuous or linear programming relaxation than is available through other methods. An implicit enumeration algorithm which uses Lagrangian relaxation, Benders' cutting planes, and local explorations is designed to exploit the strength of this linearization. Computational experience is provided to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed linearization and algorithm."

Our most striking result is that those variables which assume binary values in an optimum (VLP) solution retain the same values in an optimum (VP) solution. This result is of interest because variables are (0, 1/2, 1). valued in basic feasible solutions to (VLP) and (VLP) can be solved by a \u201cgood\u201d algorithm. This relationship and other optimality conditions are incorporated into an implicit enumeration algorithm for solving (VP). Some computational experience is reported."

We also show hardness of 38/37 for Max-3-SAT, 27/26 for vertex cover, 82/81 for Max-cut, and 94/93 for Max-2-SAT. The second part of this paper presents a \"reverse\" of the FGLSS connection by showing that an NP-hardness result for the approximation of Max clique to within a factor of N/sup 1/(g+1/) would imply a probabilistic verifier for NP with logarithmic randomness and amortized free-bit complexity g. We also show that \"existing techniques\" won't yield proof systems of less than two bits in amortized free bit complexity. Finally, we initiate a comprehensive study of PCP and FPCP parameters, proving several triviality results and providing several useful transformations."

The main result is that if a variable takes a constant binary value in all$\\hat X \\in C$, then it takes the same value in all$\\hat X \\in D$ (this may be contrasted with a well-known result of Nemhauser and Trotter, stating that if a variable takes a binary value in some$\\hat X \\in C$, then it takes the same value in some$X \\in D$). For any graph G, the set P of the vertices j such that $\\hat X_j $ has a constant binary value in all$\\hat X \\in C$, can be efficiently detected; moreover, the results in this paper imply that in the unweighted case, the subgraph induced by P has the \u201cstrong\u201d Konig\u2013Egervary property and that the subgraph induced by the complement of P has a perfect 2-matching: actually, the maximum stable sets of G are in a 1-to-1 correspondence with those of the latter subgraph."

It starts by discussing the uses of the set partitioning model; then it introduces the concepts to be used throughout the paper, and connects our problem to its close and distant relatives which play or may play a role in dealing with it: set packing and set covering, edge matching and edge covering, node packing and node covering, clique covering. The crucial equivalence between set packing/partitioning and node packing problems is introduced.Part 2 deals with structural properties of the set packing and set partitioning polytopes.

These algorithms use a simple and elegant technique that randomly rounds the solution to a nonlinear programming relaxation. This relaxation can be interpreted both as a semidefinite program and as an eigenvalue minimization problem. The best previously known approximation algorithms for these problems had performance guarantees of 1/2 for MAX CUT and 3/4 or MAX 2SAT. Slight extensions of our analysis lead to a.79607-approximation algorithm for the maximum directed cut problem (MAX DICUT) and a.758-approximation algorithm for MAX SAT, where the best previously known approximation algorithms had performance guarantees of 1/4 and 3/4, respectively.

Part I also reported successful applications from a wide range of settings, in which tabu search frequently made it possible to obtain higher quality solutions than previously obtained with competing strategies, generally with less computational effort. Part II, in this issue, examines refinements and more advanced aspects of tabu search. Following a brief review of notation, Part II introduces new dynamic strategies for managing tabu lists, allowing fuller exploitation of underlying evaluation functions.

Let ?(H) denote the cardinality of a minimum cover in the hypergraph H, and let us denote by g(n) the maximum of ?(H) taken over all hypergraphs H with n vertices and with no two hyperedges of the same size. We show thatg(n)<1.98n(1+o(1)). A special case corresponds to an old problem of Erdo?s asking for the maximum number of edges in an n-vertex graph with no two cycles of the same length. Denoting this maximum by n+f(n), we can show that f(n)?1.98n(1+o(1)). Generalizing the above, let g(n, C, k) denote the maximum of ?(H) taken over all hypergraph H with n vertices and with at most Cik edges with cardinality i for all i=1, 2, ?, n. We prove that g(n, C, k)<(Ck!+1)n(k+1)/(k+2).These results have an interesting graph-theoretic application. For a family F of graphs, let T(n, F, r) denote the maximum possible number of edges in a graph with n vertices, which contains each member of F at most r?1 times. T(n, F, 1)=T(n, F) is the classical Turan number. Using the results above, we can compute a non-trivial upper bound for T(n, F, r) for many interesting graph families."

                "text": "An instance of MAX 3CSP is a collection of m clauses of the form fi(.zil, .Q, zis), where the Zij\u2019s are literals, or constants, from the set (0, 1, ti, . . . , zn, Ii,. . . , &}, and the fi\u2019s are arbitrary Boolean functions depending on (at most) three variables. Each clause has a nonnegative weight wi associated with it. A solution to the instance is an assignment of O-l values to the variables Zl,..., C, that maximizes X:=1 wi fi(Zil, zi2, YQ), the total weight of the satisfied clauses. The MAX 3CSP problem is clearly a generalization of the MAX 3SAT problem. (In an instance of the MAX 3SAT problem fi(Gl, zi2, G3 ) = %il V %j2 V %j3 for every 1 5 i 5 m.) Karloff and Zwick have recently obtained a gapproximation algorithm for MAX 3SAT. Their algorithm is based on a new semidefinite relaxation of the problem. H&tad showed that no polynomial time algorithm can achieve a better performance ratio, unless P=NP. Here we use similar techniques to obtain a 3approximation algorithm for MAX 3CSP. The performance ratio of this algorithm is also optimal, as follows again from the work of H&tad. We also obtain better performance ratios for several special cases of the problem. Our results include: l A $-approximation algorithm for MAX SAND, the problem in which each clause is of the form zir A zi2 A zis. This result is optimal and it implies the result for MAX JCSP. l A $-approximation algorithm for MAX 3MAJ, the problem in which each clause is of the form MAJ(Zil,Zi2,Zi3), where MAJ is the ~ajotity function. This result is again optimal. l A &-approximation algorithm for MAX 3NAE, the problem in which each clause is of the form NAE(yi, Zi2, Zis), where NAE(zi, 22,x3) = 1 if and only if 21,~ and 2s are not all equal.

This work was done while this author was visiting ICSI and UC Berkeley. here that the same literal, or constant, is not allowed to appear twice in the same clause.) Finally, building on ideas of Trevisan, we get a gapproximation algorithm for satisfiable instances of MAX 3CSP. Our results imply limits on the power of non-adaptive verifiers of probabilistically checkable proofs (PCP\u2019s) that read only three bits of the proof. We also obtain a & arccos( i)-approximation algorithm for satisfiable instances of MAX SNAE. (Note that & N 0.87868 while & arccos(--Q) 21 0.91226.)"

In a companion paper [6] we have defined a family of linear inequalities that contains more compact (smaller cardinality) linearizations of a multilinear 0\u20131 program than the one based on the g.c. inequalities. In this paper we analyze the dominance relations between inequalities of the above family. In particular, we give a criterion that can be checked in linear time, for deciding whether a g.c. inequality can be strengthened by extending the cover from which it was derived. We then describe a class of algorithms based on these results and discuss our computational experience. We conclude that the g.c. inequalities can be strengthened most of the time to an extent that increases with problem density. In particular, the algorithm using the strengthening procedure outperforms the one using only g.c. inequalities whenever the number of nonlinear terms per constraint exceeds about 12\u201315, and the difference in their performance grows with the number of such terms."

The general theory of path-following and potential reduction interior point polynomial time methods, interior point methods, interior point methods for linear and quadratic programming, polynomial time methods for nonlinear convex programming, efficient computation methods for control problems and variational inequalities, and acceleration of path-following methods are covered. In this book, the authors describe the first unified theory of polynomial-time interior-point methods. Their approach provides a simple and elegant framework in which all known polynomial-time interior-point methods can be explained and analyzed; this approach yields polynomial-time interior-point methods for a wide variety of problems beyond the traditional linear and quadratic programs. The book contains new and important results in the general theory of convex programming, e.g., their \"conic\" problem formulation in which duality theory is completely symmetric. For each algorithm described, the authors carefully derive precise bounds on the computational effort required to solve a given family of problems to a given precision. In several cases they obtain better problem complexity estimates than were previously known. Several of the new algorithms described in this book, e.g., the projective method, have been implemented, tested on \"real world\" problems, and found to be extremely efficient in practice.

This result is optimal, insofar as the given constant h is maximal. The proof is polynomially constructive, i.e., it yields a polynomial algorithm, which computes an interpretation satisfying h\u00bflength(s) clauses for the 2-satisfiable cnf's s. Moreover, if h\u00bfh' and h' is e.g. algebraic, the following set is NP-complete: The 2-satisfiable cnf's s having an interpretation which satisfies at least h'\u00bflength(s) clauses."

                "text": "This paper presents the fundamental principles underlying tabu search as a strategy for combinatorial optimization problems. Tabu search has achieved impressive practical successes in applications ranging from scheduling and computer channel balancing to cluster analysis and space planning, and more recently has demonstrated its value in treating classical problems such as the traveling salesman and graph coloring problems. Nevertheless, the approach is still in its infancy, and a good deal remains to be discovered about its most effective forms of implementation and about the range of problems for which it is best suited. This paper undertakes to present the major ideas and findings to date, and to indicate challenges for future research. Part I of this study indicates the basic principles, ranging from the short-term memory process at the core of the search to the intermediate and long term memory processes for intensifying and diversifying the search. Included are illustrative data structures for implementing the tabu conditions (and associated aspiration criteria) that underlie these processes. Part I concludes with a discussion of probabilistic tabu search and a summary of computational experience for a variety of applications. Part I1 of this study (to appear in a subsequent issue) examines more advanced considerations, applying the basic ideas to special settings and outlining a dynamic move structure to insure finiteness. Part I1 also describes tabu search methods for solving mixed integer programming problems and gives a brief summary of additional practical experience, including the use of tabu search to guide other types of processes, such as those of neural networks. T a b u search is a strategy for solving combinatorial optimization problems whose applications range from graph theory and matroid settings to general pure and mixed integer programming problems. It is an adaptive procedure with the ability to make use of many other methods, such as linear programming algorithms and specialized heuristics, which it directs to overcome the limitations of local optimality. Tabu search has its origins in combinatorial procedures applied to nonlinear covering problems in the late 1970~,[~1 and subsequently applied to a diverse collection of problems ranging from scheduling and computer channel balancing to cluster analysis and space planning.'3.4,6.71 Latest research and computational comparisons involving traveling salesman, graph coloring, job shop flow sequencing, integrated circuit design and time tabling problems have likewise disclosed the ability of tabu search to obtain high quality solutions with modest computational effort, generally dominating alternative \u2026"

Although a problem with this structure may arise in many situations, it is particularly common in capital budgeting when a decision-maker is confronted with a set of investment proposals from which he must select a portfolio. If returns of proposals are intercorrelated random variables and if the decision-maker uses as his criterion for selection the mean \u03bc and variance \u03c32 of portfolio returns, his decision requires prior identification of the (\u03bc, \u03c32) efficient set. The algorithm developed to solve the problem and hence necessary to generate the efficient set is based on the concept of implicit enumeration recently introduced by Egon Balas for solution of the binary linear programming problem."

Namely, one exhibits some classes of graphs which are closed with respect to the struction; i.e., if G is in class C, then so is $G'$.One shows that for a fixed k, the class of graphs containing no induced $P_k $ (path on k nodes) is closed.

                "text": "Introduction At the foundation of the theory of games is the assumption that the players of a game can evaluate, in their utility scales, every \u201cprospect\u201d that might arise as a result of a play. In attempting to apply the theory to any field, one would normally expect to be permitted to include, in the class of \u201cprospects,\u201d the prospect of having to play a game. The possibility of evaluating games is therefore of critical importance. So long as the theory is unable to assign values to the games typically found in application, only relatively simple situations\u2014where games do not depend on other games\u2014will be susceptible to analysis and solution. In the finite theory of von Neumann and Morgenstern difficulty in evaluation persists for the \u201cessential\u201d games, and for only those. In this note we deduce a value for the \u201cessential\u201d case and examine a number of its elementary properties. We proceed from a set of three axioms, having simple intuitive interpretations, which suffice to determine the value uniquely. Our present work, though mathematically self-contained, is founded conceptually on the von Neumann\u2014Morgenstern theory up to their introduction of characteristic functions. We thereby inherit certain important underlying assumptions: (a) that utility is objective and transferable; (b) that games are cooperative affairs; (c) that games, granting (a) and (b), are adequately represented by their characteristic functions."

The objective is to minimize the weighted sum of rectilinear distances. Necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality are established. We show that the optimum locations of the new facilities are dependent on the relative orderings of old facilities along the two coordinate axes but not on the distances between them. Based on these results an algorithm is presented that requires the solution of at most m-1 minimum cut problems on networks with at most n + 2 vertices. All of these results are easily extended to the same location problem on a tree graph."

The present article surveys the techniques available to handle the important and generally neglected problem of project interrelationships such as mutual exclusion and interdependencies. The techniques utilized are linear and integer programming, dynamic programing, and the discrete optimizing procedure of Reiter. Project interrelationships arising from randomness of outcomes and nonlinear utility functions are also subjected to scrutiny by application of these procedures, and additional interrelationships, arising in the context of research and development budgets, are analyzed. A dynamic programming code for the multidimensional 0-1 knapsack problem is also presented."

We show how using a technique called branch and cut, the exact ground states of grids of sizes up to 100\u00d7100 can be determined in a moderate amount of computation time, and we report on extensive computational tests. With our method we produce results based on more than 20,000 experiments on the properties of spin glasses whose errors depend only on the assumptions on the model and not on the computational process. This feature is a clear advantage of the method over other, more popular ways to compute the ground state, like Monte Carlo simulation including simulated annealing, evolutionary, and genetic algorithms, that provide only approximate ground states with a degree of accuracy that cannot be determineda priori. Our ground-state energy estimation at zero field is \u22121.317."

                "text": "A bidirected graph is a four-tuple B = (N, A + , A , A*), where N is a set of vertices, and A', A , A* are subsets of N x N , possibly with repeated elements. Each element u = ( i , j ) of A + , A , or A* is a bidirected arc, and i, j are its endpoints. Both endpoints of an arc in A + are called heads, and both endpoints of an arc in A are called tails. If u = ( i , j ) is an arc in A*, then i is the tail of u, and j is its head. A bidirected graph B is simple if, for each pair { i , j } of vertices of B, there is at most one arc with endpoints i and j . We assume here that the endpoints of an arc are always distinct, that is, bidirected graphs are loopless. Bidirected graphs have been considered by several authors, in connection, for instance, with the study of matching polyhedra [4], network flows [9], or degreetwo inequalities [S]. We are interested here in adjoints of bidirected graphs. Let B be a bidirected graph, and let u, v be two arcs of B. We say that v follows u in B if u and v have a common endpoint, say j, such that j is a head of u and a tail of v. Two arcs are consecutive if one of them follows the other. The adjoint of B is the undirected graph whose vertices are the arcs of 8, and whose edges are the pairs of consecutive arcs of B. This definition extends in a straightforward way the classical definition of adjoint of a directed graph, except for the fact that such graphs are usually taken to be directed (see, e.g., [3]). Now, we call an undirected graph quadratic if it is the adjoint of some bidirected graph, and quadratic primitive if it is the adjoint of some simple bidirected graph. This terminology is due to Benzaken, Hammer, and Simeone, who introduced quadratic and quadratic primitive graphs in [l], [Z], and [7 ] , in connection with the study of conflict graphs and quadratic 0-1 optimization problems. Let us briefly recall the approach taken in these papers."

The authors point out that the maximization of individual wealth is not an ordinary problem in variational calculus, because the individual does not control, and may even be ignorant of, some of the variables. The general theory of social games, in their view, offers a simplified conceptual model of economic behaviour, and a study of that theory can do much to throw light on certain basic concepts of economics, for example, that of utility.Theory of Games and Economic BehaviorBy John Von Neumann Oskar Morgenstern.

The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices."

La premiere partie (chapitres 1 et 2) propose un tour d'horizon de la litterature sur les problemes de programmation fractionnaire. De nouveaux resultats theoriques et algorithmiques relatifs a la dualite et aux heuristiques lagrangiennes font l'objet de la deuxieme partie (chapitres 3, 4 et 5). Dans le chapitre 3, les problemes envisages sont modelises sous la forme de la maximisation en variables 0-1 d'un objectif hyperbolique (rapport de deux fonctions affines) soumis a des contraintes lineaires. Pour ces modeles qui sont a objectif non lineaire et non concave, une nouvelle decomposition lagrangienne est decrite. Dans le chapitre 4, on se propose d'etendre ce resultat a une classe plus large, celle des programmes fractionnaires concaves-convexes qui consistent en la maximisation d'un objectif rapport d'une fonction concave et d'une fonction convexe soumis a des contraintes convexes. Pour ces modeles a objectif non lineaire et non concave (et non convexe), nous proposons une decomposition lagrangienne construite sur un principe identique a celui du chapitre 3. Le but du chapitre 5 est la construction de deux heuristiques lagrangiennes fournissant des minorants de la valeur d'un programme hyperbolique en variables 0-1 en exploitant les solutions duales engendrees par une methode de sous-gradient appliquee tour a tour sur les deux duals lagrangiens obtenus par relaxation lagrangienne ou par decomposition lagrangienne (chapitre 3). La troisieme partie constitue la partie experimentale de notre travail, dediee a la resolution du probleme du sac a dos hyperbolique en variables 0-1: le chapitre 6 traite de la resolution du probleme de programmation hyperbolique sans contraintes ; l'application au probleme du sac a dos hyperbolique en variables 0-1 des outils algorithmiques decrits aux chapitres 3,5 et 6 est l'objet du chapitre 7"

In diesem Falle hei\u00dft {M,N} eine bimatroidale Zerlegung von \u03a3. In dieser Arbeit werden erstmals bimatroidale Systeme untersucht. Ist die Klasse aller Kreise eines beliebigen Unabh\u00e4ngigkeitssystems \u03a3 (oder sind \u00e4quivalent damit die Restriktionen eines Mengen\u00fcberdeckunsproblems) gegeben, so stellt sich folgende Frage: erlaubt \u03a3 eine bimatroidale Zerlegung (M, N), und wenn, wie k\u00f6nnen die Kreise vonM undN erzeugt werden? F\u00fcr dieses Problem werden eine Reihe von Resultaten gezeigt. Ferner wird ein zeitpolynomialer Algorithmus f\u00fcr dieses Problem in dem Fall angegeben, da\u00df je zwei verschiedene Kreise von \u03a3 h\u00f6chstens ein Element gemeinsam haben. Au\u00dferdem schlagen wir verschiedene zeitpolynomiale Algorithmen f\u00fcr Mengen\u00fcberdeckungsprobleme vor, die \u00fcber der Klasse der Kreise bimatroidaler Systeme derfiniert sind.AbstractAn independence system \u03a3=(X, F) is called bimatroidal if there exist two matroidsM=(X FM) andN=(X, FN) such thatF=FM\u222a FN. When this is the case, {M,N} is called a bimatroidal decomposition of \u03a3. This paper initiates the study of bimatroidal systems. Given the collection of circuits of an arbitrary independence system \u03a3 (or, equivalently, the constraints of a set-covering problem), we address the following question: does \u03a3 admit a bimatroidal decomposition {M,N} and, if so, how can we actually produce the circuits ofM andN? We derive a number of results concerning this problem, and we present a polynomial time algorithm to solve it when every two circuits of \u03a3 have at most one common element. We also propose different polynomial time algorithms for set covering problems defined on the circuit-set of bimatroidal systems."
