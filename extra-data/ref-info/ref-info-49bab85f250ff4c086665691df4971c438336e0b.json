However, it is still an open question whether the state-of-the-art technologies in automated text categorization can scale to (and perform well on) such large taxonomies. In this paper, we report the first evaluation of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in web-page classification over the full taxonomy of the Yahoo! categories. Our accomplishments include: 1) a data analysis on the Yahoo! taxonomy; 2) the development of a scalable system for large-scale text categorization; 3) theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation of SVMs in hierarchical and non-hierarchical settings for classification; 4) an investigation of threshold tuning algorithms with respect to time complexity and their effect on the classification accuracy of SVMs. We found that, in terms of scalability, the hierarchical use of SVMs is efficient enough for very large-scale classification; however, in terms of effectiveness, the performance of SVMs over the Yahoo! Directory is still far from satisfactory, which indicates that more substantial investigation is needed."

We use the semantics of image labels to integrate prior knowledge about inter-class relationships into the visual appearance learning. We show how to build and train a semantic hierarchy of discriminative classifiers and how to use it to perform object detection. We evaluate how our approach influences the classification accuracy and speed on the Pascal VOC challenge 2006 dataset, a set of challenging real-world images. We also demonstrate additional features that become available to object recognition due to the extension with semantic inference tools- we can classify high-level categories, such as animals, and we can train part detectors, for example a window detector, by pure inference in the semantic network."

This approach is quite flexible, and permits recognition based on color, texture, and particularly shape, in a homogeneous framework. While nearest neighbor classifiers are natural in this setting, they suffer from the problem of high variance (in bias-variance decomposition) in the case of limited sampling. Alternatively, one could use support vector machines but they involve time-consuming optimization and computation of pairwise distances. We propose a hybrid of these two methods which deals naturally with the multiclass setting, has reasonable computational complexity both in training and at run time, and yields excellent results in practice. The basic idea is to find close neighbors to a query sample and train a local support vector machine that preserves the distance function on the collection of neighbors. Our method can be applied to large, multiclass data sets for which it outperforms nearest neighbor and support vector machines, and remains efficient when the problem becomes intractable for support vector machines. A wide variety of distance functions can be used and our experiments show state-of-the-art performance on a number of benchmark data sets for shape and texture classification (MNIST, USPS, CUReT) and object recognition (Caltech- 101). On Caltech-101 we achieved a correct classification rate of 59.05%(\u00b10.56%) at 15 training images per class, and 66.23%(\u00b10.48%) at 30 training images."

Traditional approaches learn a classifier for each class separately and apply each of them in an exhaustive search over positions and scales. We achieve an efficient detection by organizing the search coarse-to-fine based on a hierarchical partitioning of the entire hypothesis space, the set of all possible object instances, so that groups of hypotheses can be pruned simultaneously without evaluating each one individually. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to jointly learn the hierarchy along with a classifier at each node by exploring the common parts shared among a group of object instances at all levels in the hierarchy. We also show how the confusions of the initial coarse-to-fine search can be resolved by comparing pairs of conflicting detections using cheap binary classifiers. The whole process is illustrated by detecting and recognizing handwritten digits."

As in that work, we first apply Gabor filters at all positions and scales; feature complexity and position/scale invariance are then built up by alternating template matching and max pooling operations. We refine the approach in several biologically plausible ways, using simple versions of sparsification and lateral inhibition. We demonstrate the value of retaining some position and scale information above the intermediate feature level. Using feature selection we arrive at a model that performs better with fewer features. Our final model is tested on the Caltech 101 object categories and the UIUC car localization task, in both cases achieving state-of-the-art performance. The results strengthen the case for using this class of model in computer vision."

Each image is represented by an unordered set of local features, and all sets are embedded into a space where they cluster according to their partial-match feature correspondences. After efficiently computing the pairwise affinities between the input images in this space, a spectral clustering technique is used to recover the primary groupings among the images. We introduce an efficient means of refining these groupings according to intra-cluster statistics over the subsets of features selected by the partial matches between the images, and based on an optional, variable amount of user supervision. We compute the consistent subsets of feature correspondences within a grouping to infer category feature masks. The output of the algorithm is a partition of the data into a set of learned categories, and a set of classifiers trained from these ranked partitions that can recognize the categories in novel images."

In a first stage, the method automatically identifies distinctive parts in the training set by applying a clustering algorithm to patterns selected by an interest operator.

That is, given a novel image we want to recognize and localize unseen-before objects based on their similarity to a learned object category. For use in a real-world system, it is important that this includes the ability to recognize objects at multiple scales. In this paper, we present an approach to multi-scale object categorization using scale-invariant interest points and a scale-adaptive Mean-Shift search. The approach builds on the method from [12], which has been demonstrated to achieve excellent results for the single-scale case, and extends it to multiple scales.

Kernel-based classification methods can learn complex decision boundaries, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences epsivnerally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast kernel function which maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in this space. This \"pyramid match\" computation is linear in the number of features, and it implicitly finds correspondences based on the finest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair first appears. Since the kernel does not penalize the presence of extra features, it is robust to clutter. We show the kernel function is positive-definite, making it valid for use in learning algorithms whose optimal solutions are guaranteed only for Mercer kernels. We demonstrate our algorithm on object recognition tasks and show it to be accurate and dramatically faster than current approaches"

The underlying hierarchical structure identifies the relationships of dependence between different categories and provides valuable sources of information for categorization. Although considerable research has been conducted in the field of hierarchical document categorization, little has been done on automatic generation of topic hierarchies. In this paper, we propose the method of using linear discriminant projection to generate more meaningful intermediate levels of hierarchies in large flat sets of classes. The linear discriminant projection approach first transforms all documents onto a low-dimensional space and then clusters the categories into hier- archies accordingly. The paper also investigates the effect of using generated hierarchical structure for text classification. Our experiments show that generated hierarchies improve classification performance in most cases."

This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

Our approach is sequential testing which is coarse-to-fine in both in the exploration of poses and the representation of objects. All the tests are binary and indicate the presence or absence of loose spatial arrangements of oriented edge fragments. Starting from training examples, we recursively find larger and larger arrangements which are \u201cdecomposable,\u201d which implies the probability of an arrangement appearing on an object decays slowly with its size. Detection means finding a sufficient number of arrangements of each size along a decreasing sequence of pose cells. At the beginning, the tests are simple and universal, accommodating many poses simultaneously, but the false alarm rate is relatively high. Eventually, the tests are more discriminating, but also more complex and dedicated to specific poses. As a result, the spatial distribution of processing is highly skewed and detection is rapid, but at the expense of (isolated) false alarms which, presumably, could be eliminated with localized, more intensive, processing."

                "text": "Multiclass shape detection, in the sense of recognizing and localizing instances from multiple shape classes, is formulated as a two-step process in which local indexing primes global interpretation. During indexing a list of instantiations (shape identities and poses) is compiled, constrained only by no missed detections at the expense of false positives. Global information, such as expected relationships among poses, is incorporated afterward to remove ambiguities. This division is motivated by computational efficiency. In addition, indexing itself is organized as a coarse-to-fine search simultaneously in class and pose. This search can be interpreted as successive approximations to likelihood ratio tests arising from a simple (\"naive Bayes\") statistical model for the edge maps extracted from the original images. The key to constructing efficient \"hypothesis tests\" for multiple classes and poses is local ORing; in particular, spread edges provide imprecise but common and locally invariant features. Natural tradeoffs then emerge between discrimination and the pattern of spreading. These are analyzed mathematically within the model-based framework and the whole procedure is illustrated by experiments in reading license plates."

We first observed an interesting computational property of the object hierarchy: comparing the recognition rate when using models of objects at different levels, the higher more inclusive levels (e.g., closed-frame vehicles or vehicles) exhibit higher recall but lower precision when compared with the class specific level (e.g., bus). These inherent differences suggest that combining object classifiers from different hierarchical levels into a single classifier may improve classification, as it appears like these models capture different aspects of the object. We describe a method to combine these classifiers, and analyze the conditions under which improvement can be guaranteed. When given a small sample of a new object class, we describe a method to transfer knowledge across the tree hierarchy, between related objects. Finally, we describe extensive experiments using object hierarchies obtained from publicly available datasets, and show that the combined classifiers significantly improve recognition results."

When model databases are large, the use of high-dimensional features is critical, due to the improved level of discrimination they can provide. Unfortunately, finding the nearest neighbour to a query point rapidly becomes inefficient as the dimensionality of the feature space increases. Past indexing methods have used hash tables for hypothesis recovery, but only in low-dimensional situations. In this paper we show that a new variant of the k-d tree search algorithm makes indexing in higher-dimensional spaces practical. This Best Bin First, or BBF search is an approximate algorithm which finds the nearest neighbour for a large fraction of the queries, and a very close neighbour in the remaining cases. The technique has been integrated into a fully developed recognition system, which is able to detect complex objects in real, cluttered scenes in just a few seconds."

Many hand-crafted descriptors have been proposed in the literature for measuring visual similarity. Looking past initial differences, what really distinguishes one descriptor from another is the tradeoff that it achieves between discriminative power and invariance. Since this trade-off must vary from task to task, no single descriptor can be optimal in all situations. Our focus, in this paper, is on learning the optimal tradeoff for classification given a particular training set and prior constraints. The problem is posed in the kernel learning framework. We learn the optimal, domain-specific kernel as a combination of base kernels corresponding to base features which achieve different levels of trade-off (such as no invariance, rotation invariance, scale invariance, affine invariance, etc.) This leads to a convex optimisation problem with a unique global optimum which can be solved for efficiently. The method is shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the UIUC textures, Oxford flowers and Cal- tech 101 datasets."

This local scaling leads to better clustering especially when the data includes multiple scales and when the clusters are placed within a cluttered background.

There are three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the \u201cIntegral Image\u201d which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a simple and efficient classifier which is built using the AdaBoost learning algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1995) to select a small number of critical visual features from a very large set of potential features. The third contribution is a method for combining classifiers in a \u201ccascade\u201d which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising face-like regions. A set of experiments in the domain of face detection is presented. The system yields face detection performance comparable to the best previous systems (Sung and Poggio, 1998; Rowley et al., 1998; Schneiderman and Kanade, 2000; Roth et al., 2000). Implemented on a conventional desktop, face detection proceeds at 15 frames per second."

The fundamental assumption of the proposed theory, recognition-by-components (RBC), is that a modest set of generalized-cone components, called geons (N \u00a3 36), can be derived from contrasts of five readily detectable properties of edges in a two-dimensiona l image: curvature, collinearity, symmetry, parallelism, and cotermination. The detection of these properties is generally invariant over viewing position an$ image quality and consequently allows robust object perception when the image is projected from a novel viewpoint or is degraded. RBC thus provides a principled account of the heretofore undecided relation between the classic principles of perceptual organization and pattern recognition: The constraints toward regularization (Pragnanz) characterize not the complete object but the object's components. Representational power derives from an allowance of free combinations of the geons. A Principle of Componential Recovery can account for the major phenomena of object recognition: If an arrangement of two or three geons can be recovered from the input, objects can be quickly recognized even when they are occluded, novel, rotated in depth, or extensively degraded. The results from experiments on the perception of briefly presented pictures by human observers provide empirical support for the theory. Any single object can project an infinity of image configurations to the retina. The orientation of the object to the viewer can vary continuously, each giving rise to a different two-dimensional projection. The object can be occluded by other objects or texture fields, as when viewed behind foliage. The object need not be presented as a full-colored textured image but instead can be a simplified line drawing. Moreover, the object can even be missing some of its parts or be a novel exemplar of its particular category. But it is only with rare exceptions that an image fails to be rapidly and readily classified, either as an instance of a familiar object category or as an instance that cannot be so classified (itself a form of classification)."

The performance is measured against changes in viewpoint, scale, illumination, defocus and image compression.The objective of this paper is also to establish a reference test set of images and performance software, so that future detectors can be evaluated in the same framework."
