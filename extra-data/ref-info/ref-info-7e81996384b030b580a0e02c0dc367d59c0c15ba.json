Such regions are then described by a set of invariant features, which makes it relatively easy to match them between views and under changing illumination. In previous work, we have presented invariant regions that are based on a combination of corners and edges. The application discussed then was image database retrieval. Here, an alternative method for extracting (affinely) invariant regions is given, that does not depend on the presence of edges or corners in the image but is purely intensity-based. Also, we demonstrate the use of such regions for another application, which is wide baseline stereo matching. As a matter of fact, the goal is to build an opportunistic system that exploits several types of invariant regions as it sees fit. This yields more correspondences and a system that can deal with a wider range of images. To increase the robustness of the system even further, two semi-local constraints on combinations of region correspondences are derived (one geometric, the other photometric). They allow to test the consistency of correspondences and hence to reject falsely matched regions."

The choice of image elements that are put into correspondence in the wide-baseline matching problem is discussed. The concept of a distinguished region is introduced and formally defined and it is argued distinguished regions are very good candidates for matching. Two new types of distinguished regions, the Separated Elementary Cycles of the Edge Graph (SECs) and the Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSERs), are introduced. For both types, an efficient (near linear complexity) and practically fast detection algorithm is presented. Experimentally the stability of the proposed DRs is shown on disparate views of real-world scenes with significant change of scale, camera rotation and 3D translation of the viewpoint. A new robust similarity measure for establishing tentative correspondences is proposed. The robustness ensures that invariants from multiple measurement regions, some that are significantly larger (and hence discriminative) than the distinguished region, may be used to establish tentative correspondences. In experiments on indoor and outdoor image pairs, good estimates of epipolar geometry are obtained on challenging wide-baseline problems with the robustified matching algorithm operating on the output produced by the proposed detectors of distinguished regions. Locally fully affine distortions and significant occlusion were present in the tests."

This facilitates matching between quite disparate views-wide baseline stereo. Two extensions are made to the current small baseline algorithms: first, and most importantly, a viewpoint invariant measure is developed for assessing the affinity of corner neighbourhoods over image pairs; second, algorithms are given for generating putative corner matches between image pairs using local homographies. Two novel infrastructure developments are also described: the automatic generation of local homographies, and the combination of possibly conflicting sets of matches prior to RANSAC estimation. The wide baseline matching algorithm is demonstrated on a number of image pairs with varying relative motion, and for different scene types. All processing is automatic."

Unlike conventional stereo matching approaches we assume no prior knowledge about the relative camera positions and orientations. In fact in our application this is the information we wish to determine from the image feature matches. Features are detected in two or more images and characterised using affine texture invariants. The problem of window effects is explicitly addressed by our method-our feature characterisation is invariant to linear transformations of the image data including rotation, stretch and skew. The feature matching process is optimised for a structure-from-motion application where we wish to ignore unreliable matches at the expense of reducing the number of feature matches."

We propose an algorithm which is capable of handling larger changes in viewpoint than classical correlation based techniques. Optimal performance for the algorithm is achieved for textured objects which are locally planar in at least one direction. The algorithm works by computing affinely invariant fourier features from intensity profiles in each image. The intensity profiles are extracted from the image data between randomly selected pairs of image interest points. Using a voting scheme, pairs of interest points are matched across images by comparing vectors of fourier features. Outliers among the matches are rejected in two stages, a fast stage using novel view consistency constraints, and a second, slower stage using RANSAC and fundamental matrix computation. In order to demonstrate the quality of the results, the algorithm is tested on several different image pairs."

In this paper we propose an experimental comparison of several different stereo algorithms. We use real imagery, and explore two different methodologies, with different strengths and weaknesses. Our first methodology is based upon manual computation of dense ground truth. Here we make use of a two stereo pairs: one of these, from the University of Tsukuba, contains mostly fronto-parallel surfaces; while the other, which we built, is a simple scene with a slanted surface. Our second methodology uses the notion of prediction error, which is the ability of a disparity map to predict an (unseen) third image, taken from a known camera position with respect to the input pair. We present results for both correlation-style stereo algorithms and techniques based on global methods such as energy minimization. Our experiments suggest that the two methodologies give qualitatively consistent results. Source images and additional materials, such as the implementations of various algorithms, are available on the web from http://www.research.microsoft.com/ \u0303szeliski/stereo."

                "text": "This paper considers the problem of self-calibration of a camera from an image sequence in the case where the camera's internal parameters (most notably focal length) may change. The problem of camera self-calibration from a sequence of images has proven to be a difficult one in practice, due to the need ultimately to resort to non-linear methods, which have often proven to be unreliable. In a stratified approach to self-calibration, a projective reconstruction is obtained first and this is successively refined first to an affine and then to a Euclidean (or metric) reconstruction. It has been observed that the difficult step is to obtain the affine reconstruction, or equivalently to locate the plane at infinity in the projective coordinate frame. The problem is inherently non-linear and requires iterative methods that risk not finding the optimal solution. The present paper overcomes this difficulty by imposing chirality constraints to limit the search for the plane at infinity to a 3-dimensional cubic region of parameter space. It is then possible to carry out a dense search over this cube in reasonable time. For each hypothesised placement of the plane at infinity, the calibration problem is reduced to one of calibration of a nontranslating camera, for which fast non-iterative algorithms exist. A cost function based on the result of the trial calibration is used to determine the best placement of the plane at infinity. Because of the simplicity of each trial, speeds of over 10,000 trials per second are achieved on a 256 MHz processor. It is shown that this dense search allows one to avoid areas of local minima effectively and find global minima of the cost function."

View sphere sampling is important for plenoptic (image-based) modeling that captures the appearance of a scene by storing images from all possible directions. The plenoptic approach is appealing since it allows, in principle, fast scene rendering of scenes with complex geometry and surface reflections, without the need for an explicit geometrical scene model. However the acquired images have to be calibrated, and current approaches mostly use pre-calibrated acquisition systems. This limits the generality of the approach. We propose using an uncalibrated hand-held camera only. The image sequence is acquired by simply waving the camera around the scene objects, creating a zigzag scan path over the viewing sphere. We extend the sequential camera tracking of an existing structure-from-motion approach to the calibration of a mesh of viewpoints. Novel views are generated by piecewise mapping and interpolating the new image from the nearest viewpoints according to the viewpoint mesh. Local depth map estimates enhance the rendering process. Extensive experiments with ground truth data and hand-held sequences confirm the performance of our approach."

It is shown that a geometric image error can be minimized over all views by a simple three parameter numerical optimization. Then, that an algebraic image error can be minimized over all views by computing the solution to a cubic in one variable. Finally, a minor point, is that this \"quasi-linear\" linear solution enables a more concise algorithm, than any given previously, for the reconstruction of 6 points in 3 views. \n \nThe second contribution is an m view n \u2265 6 point robust reconstruction algorithm which uses the 6 point method as a search engine. This extends the successful RANSAC based algorithms for 2-views and 3-views to m views. The algorithm can cope with missing data and mismatched data and may be used as an efficient initializer for bundle adjustment. \n \nThe new algorithms are evaluated on synthetic and real image sequences, and compared to optimal estimation results (bundle adjustment)."

It is applicable to texture patches which are locally planar and have stationary statistics. The novelty of the descriptor is that it is based on statistics aggregated over the region, resulting in richer and more stable descriptors than those computed at a point. Two texture matching applications of this descriptor are demonstrated: (1) it is used to automatically identify, regions of the same type of texture, but with varying surface pose, within a single image; (2) it is used to support wide baseline stereo, i.e. to enable the automatic computation of the epipolar geometry between two images acquired from quite separated viewpoints. Results are presented on several sets of real images."

This article describes a way of reducing this effect for a general class of methods for deriving 3-D shape cues from 2-D image data, which are based on the estimation of locally linearized distortion of brightness patterns. By extending the linear scale-space concept into an affine scale-space representation and performing affine shape adaption of the smoothing kernels, the accuracy of surface orientation estimates derived from texture and disparity cues can be improved by typically one order of magnitude. The reason for this is that the image descriptors, on which the methods are based, will be relative invariant under affine transformations, and the error will thus be confined to the higher-order terms in the locally linearized perspective mapping."

Bundle adjustment is the problem of refining a visual reconstruction to produce jointly optimal structure and viewing parameter estimates. Topics covered include: the choice of cost function and robustness; numerical optimization including sparse Newton methods, linearly convergent approximations, updating and recursive methods; gauge (datum) invariance; and quality control. The theory is developed for general robust cost functions rather than restricting attention to traditional nonlinear least squares."

Our technique is taster because it examines far fewer potential matches between the images than existing techniques Furthermore, this registration technique can be generalized to handle rotation, scaling and shearing. We show how our technique can be adapted tor use in a stereo vision system."
