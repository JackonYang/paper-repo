The distance transform produces a distance map in which each pixel is a vector of two integer components. If a distance map is created inside the objects, the two integer values of a pixel in the distance map represent the displacements of the pixel from the nearest background point in the x and y directions, respectively. The unique feature of this distance transform, that a vector in the distance map is always pointing to the nearest background point, is exploited in several applications, such as the detection of dominant point in digital curves, curve smoothing, computing Dirichlet tessellations and finding convex hulls.<<ETX>>"

This algorithm is similar to Blum's transform in that it fits spheres into a volume, but it is different in that it fits only tangential spheres, and thereby the data reduction is larger than by Blum's transform. The spheres are of variable radii, which enables us to achieve a hierarchy of intrinsic volume properties, i.e., from gross to more detailed. The result of this algorithm is a graph where the nodes are the centers of spheres and the arcs are the connections between two tangent spheres. Analysis of computational complexity and the time and error considerations are provided."
