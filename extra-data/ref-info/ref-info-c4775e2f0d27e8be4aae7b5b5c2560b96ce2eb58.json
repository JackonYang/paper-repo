We have recently (July and August 1978) achieved error-free or nearly error-free decoding results with several different acoustic processors on sentences from the New Raleigh Language (vocabulary 250 words, perplexity 7.27 words). One of these processors, which achieved a 0% error rate on New Raleigh sentences, has been used to decode sentences from the New Raleigh Language without the benefit of syntactic guidance during the decoding process. On this much more difficult task, it has achieved an error rate of 8.8% at the word level, corresponding to a sentence error rate of 53%. All of these processors are non-segmenting processors which produce output once every 10ms."

Output segments, usually 10 msec. in length, vary dynamically from .1 msec. to over 100 msec. to capture significant events in the underlying acoustic phone structure. Segment labels are determined by matching against a set of about 200 automatically selected prototypes. Some statistics on the fraction of segments correctly labeled (from a choice of 52 labels) and their most likely confusions are included. Speech recognition results obtained using the HEAR acoustic processor in conjunction with the training and decoding procedures of the IBM Research Continuous Speech Recognition mainline system are presented. On a set of 125 test sentences (1010 words) of the \"New Raleigh Language\" (artificial language, 250 word vocabulary, perplexity 7.27), the sentence recognition rate is 100%. On a set of 10 test sentences (282 words) of the \"Laser-1000 Language\" (natural language, 1000 word vocabulary, perplexity 21.1), the word recognition rate is 80%. Although it generally is difficult to ascribe errors to specific system components, three classes of errors are observed: 1) the correct word is not hypothesized; therefore acoustic match is not performed, 10.3% words, 2) the correct word is hypothesized but search is pruned prior to the construction of longer phrases including it, 6.4%, 3) the correct word is hypothesized, fully matched, and rejected in favor of an incorrect word, 3.2%. Errors of the third class are comprised exclusively of short function words (e.g. \"the\", \"of\", etc.), 2.2%, and deleted commas (realized acoustically by optional interword pauses), 1.0%."

Knowledge is represented in the Hearsay- 1 system as procedures and in the Dragon system as a Markov network with a- priori transition probabilities between states. Systematic performance analysis of various design choices of these two systems resulted in the HARPY system, in which knowledge is represented as a finite state transition network but without the a-priori transition probabilities. Harpy searches only a few 'best' syntactic (and acoustic) paths in parallel to determine the optimal path, and uses segmentation to effectively reduce the utterance length, thereby reducing the number of state probability updates that must be done. Several new heuristics have been added to the HARPY system to improve its performance and speed: detection of common sub-nets and collapsing them to reduce overall network size and complexity, eliminating the need for doing an acoustic match for all phonemic types at every time sample, and semi-automatic techniques for learning the lexical representations (that are needed for a steady-state system of this type) and the phonemic templates from training data, thus automatically accounting for the commonly occurring intra-word coarticulation and juncture phenomena. Inter-word phenomena are handled by the use of juncture rules which are applied at network generation time, thereby eliminating the need for repetitive and time consuming application of phonological rules during the recognition phase."

Many new problems arise in recognition of a substantial natural corpus (compared to recognition of an artificially constrained language). Some techniques are described for treating these problems.
