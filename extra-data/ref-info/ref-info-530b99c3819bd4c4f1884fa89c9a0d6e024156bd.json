In this paper, we present a statistical natural language processing model for image retrieval, which integrates semantic information provided by WordNet, an online lexical reference system, and low-level visual features. In our system, the semantic hierarchy of word senses from WordNet is used to strengthen the association between images and the textual description of a concept. A statistical keyword selection algorithm is followed to choose the most representative keywords to annotate those images of the concept. We test our model on a landscape image database with 10 different concepts. Our experimental results show that our approach could greatly improve the retrieval accuracy. The results also demonstrate the high potential of our approach in building ontologies of image databases."

This bag of keypoints method is based on vector quantization of affine invariant descriptors of image patches. We propose and compare two alternative implementations using different classifiers: Naive Bayes and SVM. The main advantages of the method are that it is simple, computationally efficient and intrinsically invariant. We present results for classifying nine semantic visual categories and comment on results obtained by Fergus et al using a different method on the same data set. We obtain excellent results as well for multi class categorization as for object detection. A thorough evaluation clearly demonstrates that our method is robust to background clutter and produces good categorization accuracy even without exploiting geometric information."

Machine learning approaches have been explored to model the association between words and images from an annotated set of images and generate annotations for a test image. The paper proposes methods to use a hierarchy defined on the annotation words derived from a text ontology to improve automatic image annotation and retrieval. Specifically, the hierarchy is used in the context of generating a visual vocabulary for representing images and as a framework for the proposed hierarchical classification approach for automatic image annotation. The effect of using the hierarchy in generating the visual vocabulary is demonstrated by improvements in the annotation performance of translation models. In addition to performance improvements, hierarchical classification approaches yield well to constructing multimedia ontologies."

This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms) of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Mover\u2019s Distance and the \u03c72 distance. We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class variations and substantial background clutter."

This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms) of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Mover\u2019s Distance and the 2 distance. We r st evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classier s. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on 4 texture and 5 object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the inuence of background correlations on recognition performance."

                "text": "The fact that objects in the world appear in different ways depending on the scale of observation has important implications if one aims at describing them. It shows that the notion of scale is of utmost importance when processing unknown measurement data by automatic methods. In their seminal works, Witkin (1983) and Koenderink (1984) proposed to approach this problem by representing image structures at different scales in a so-called scale-space representation. Traditional scale-space theory building on this work, however, does not address the problem of how to select local appropriate scales for further analysis. This article proposes a systematic methodology for dealing with this problem. A framework is presented for generating hypotheses about interesting scale levels in image data, based on a general principle stating that local extrema over scales of different combinations of \u03b3-normalized derivatives are likely candidates to correspond to interesting structures. Specifically, it is shown how this idea can be used as a major mechanism in algorithms for automatic scale selection, which adapt the local scales of processing to the local image structure.Support for the proposed approach is given in terms of a general theoretical investigation of the behaviour of the scale selection method under rescalings of the input pattern and by integration with different types of early visual modules, including experiments on real-world and synthetic data. Support is also given by a detailed analysis of how different types of feature detectors perform when integrated with a scale selection mechanism and then applied to characteristic model patterns. Specifically, it is described in detail how the proposed methodology applies to the problems of blob detection, junction detection, edge detection, ridge detection and local frequency estimation.In many computer vision applications, the poor performance of the low-level vision modules constitutes a major bottleneck. It is argued that the inclusion of mechanisms for automatic scale selection is essential if we are to construct vision systems to automatically analyse complex unknown environments."

This paper shows that support vector machines (SVM's) can generalize well on difficult image classification problems where the only features are high dimensional histograms. Heavy-tailed RBF kernels of the form K(x, y) = e(-rho)Sigma(i)/xia-yia/b with a < or = 1 and b < or = 2 are evaluated on the classification of images extracted from the Corel stock photo collection and shown to far outperform traditional polynomial or Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernels. Moreover, we observed that a simple remapping of the input x(i)-->x(i)(a) improves the performance of linear SVM's to such an extend that it makes them, for this problem, a valid alternative to RBF kernels."

The description of color is hampered by the large amount of variations which causes the measured color values to vary significantly. In this paper we aim to extend the description of local features with color information. To accomplish a wide applicability of the color descriptor, it should be robust to: 1. photometric changes commonly encountered in the real world, 2. varying image quality; from high quality images to snap-shot photo quality and compressed internet images. Based on these requirements we derive a set of color descriptors. The set of proposed descriptors are compared by extensive testing on multiple applications areas, namely, matching, retrieval and classification, and on a wide variety of image qualities. The results show that color descriptors remain reliable under photometric and geometrical changes, and with decreasing image quality. For all experiments a combination of color and shape outperforms a pure shape-based approach."

However, due to the computational demands of these approaches, applications to large problems such as spatiotemporal data and high resolution imagery have been slow to appear. The contribution of this paper is a method that substantially reduces the computational requirements of grouping algorithms based on spectral partitioning making it feasible to apply them to very large grouping problems. Our approach is based on a technique for the numerical solution of eigenfunction problems known as the Nystrom method. This method allows one to extrapolate the complete grouping solution using only a small number of samples. In doing so, we leverage the fact that there are far fewer coherent groups in a scene than pixels."

After introducing the basic concepts of neurons and artificial neuron learning rules in Chapter 2, Chapter 3 describes a particular formalism, based on signal-plus-noise, for the learning problem in general. After presenting the basic neural network types this chapter reviews the principal algorithms for error function minimization/optimization and shows how these learning issues are addressed in various supervised models. Chapter 4 deals with issues in unsupervised learning networks, such as the Hebbian learning rule, principal component learning, and learning vector quantization. Various techniques and learning paradigms are covered in Chapters 3\u20136, and especially the properties and relative merits of the multilayer perceptron networks, radial basis function networks, self-organizing feature maps and reinforcement learning are discussed in the respective four chapters. Chapter 7 presents an in-depth examination of performance issues in supervised learning, such as accuracy, complexity, convergence, weight initialization, architecture selection, and active learning. Par III (Chapters 8\u201315) offers an extensive presentation of techniques and issues in evolutionary computing. Besides the introduction to the basic concepts in evolutionary computing, it elaborates on the more important and most frequently used techniques on evolutionary computing paradigm, such as genetic algorithms, genetic programming, evolutionary programming, evolutionary strategies, differential evolution, cultural evolution, and co-evolution, including design aspects, representation, operators and performance issues of each paradigm. The differences between evolutionary computing and classical optimization are also explained. Part IV (Chapters 16 and 17) introduces swarm intelligence. It provides a representative selection of recent literature on swarm intelligence in a coherent and readable form. It illustrates the similarities and differences between swarm optimization and evolutionary computing. Both particle swarm optimization and ant colonies optimization are discussed in the two chapters, which serve as a guide to bringing together existing work to enlighten the readers, and to lay a foundation for any further studies. Part V (Chapters 18\u201321) presents fuzzy systems, with topics ranging from fuzzy sets, fuzzy inference systems, fuzzy controllers, to rough sets. The basic terminology, underlying motivation and key mathematical models used in the field are covered to illustrate how these mathematical tools can be used to handle vagueness and uncertainty. This book is clearly written and it brings together the latest concepts in computational intelligence in a friendly and complete format for undergraduate/postgraduate students as well as professionals new to the field. With about 250 pages covering such a wide variety of topics, it would be impossible to handle everything at a great length. Nonetheless, this book is an excellent choice for readers who wish to familiarize themselves with computational intelligence techniques or for an overview/introductory course in the field of computational intelligence.

Our scale and affine invariant detectors are based on the following recent results: (1) Interest points extracted with the Harris detector can be adapted to affine transformations and give repeatable results (geometrically stable). (2) The characteristic scale of a local structure is indicated by a local extremum over scale of normalized derivatives (the Laplacian). (3) The affine shape of a point neighborhood is estimated based on the second moment matrix.Our scale invariant detector computes a multi-scale representation for the Harris interest point detector and then selects points at which a local measure (the Laplacian) is maximal over scales. This provides a set of distinctive points which are invariant to scale, rotation and translation as well as robust to illumination changes and limited changes of viewpoint. The characteristic scale determines a scale invariant region for each point. We extend the scale invariant detector to affine invariance by estimating the affine shape of a point neighborhood. An iterative algorithm modifies location, scale and neighborhood of each point and converges to affine invariant points. This method can deal with significant affine transformations including large scale changes. The characteristic scale and the affine shape of neighborhood determine an affine invariant region for each point.We present a comparative evaluation of different detectors and show that our approach provides better results than existing methods. The performance of our detector is also confirmed by excellent matching results; the image is described by a set of scale/affine invariant descriptors computed on the regions associated with our points."
