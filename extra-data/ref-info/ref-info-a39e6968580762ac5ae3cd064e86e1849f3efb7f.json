We construct video representations in terms of local space-time features and integrate such representations with SVM classification schemes for recognition. For the purpose of evaluation we introduce a new video database containing 2391 sequences of six human actions performed by 25 people in four different scenarios. The presented results of action recognition justify the proposed method and demonstrate its advantage compared to other relative approaches for action recognition."

Following the idea of local features in the spatial domain, we use the notion of space-time interest points and represent video data in terms of local space-time events. To describe such events, we define several types of image descriptors over local spatio-temporal neighborhoods and evaluate these descriptors in the context of recognizing human activities. In particular, we compare motion representations in terms of spatio-temporal jets, position dependent histograms, position independent histograms, and principal component analysis computed for either spatio-temporal gradients or optic flow. An experimental evaluation on a video database with human actions shows that high classification performance can be achieved, and that there is a clear advantage of using local position dependent histograms, consistent with previously reported findings regarding spatial recognition."

It mainly relies on the discriminative power of individual local space-time descriptors, whilst ignoring potentially valuable information about the global spatio-temporal distribution of interest points. In this paper, we propose a novel action recognition approach which differs significantly from previous interest points based approaches in that only the global spatiotemporal distribution of the interest points are exploited. This is achieved through extracting holistic features from clouds of interest points accumulated over multiple temporal scales followed by automatic feature selection. Our approach avoids the non-trivial problems of selecting the optimal space-time descriptor, clustering algorithm for constructing a codebook, and selecting codebook size faced by previous interest points based methods. Our model is able to capture smooth motions, robust to view changes and occlusions at a low computation cost. Experiments using the KTH and WEIZMANN datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms most existing methods."

This challenging but important subject has mostly been ignored in the past due to several problems one of which is the lack of realistic and annotated video datasets. Our first contribution is to address this limitation and to investigate the use of movie scripts for automatic annotation of human actions in videos. We evaluate alternative methods for action retrieval from scripts and show benefits of a text-based classifier. Using the retrieved action samples for visual learning, we next turn to the problem of action classification in video. We present a new method for video classification that builds upon and extends several recent ideas including local space-time features, space-time pyramids and multi-channel non-linear SVMs. The method is shown to improve state-of-the-art results on the standard KTH action dataset by achieving 91.8% accuracy. Given the inherent problem of noisy labels in automatic annotation, we particularly investigate and show high tolerance of our method to annotation errors in the training set. We finally apply the method to learning and classifying challenging action classes in movies and show promising results."

While some detectors can only extract a sparse set of scale-invariant features, others allow for the detection of a larger amount of features at user-defined scales. This paper presents for the first time spatio-temporal interest points that are at the same time scale-invariant (both spatially and temporally) and densely cover the video content. Moreover, as opposed to earlier work, the features can be computed efficiently. Applying scale-space theory, we show that this can be achieved by using the determinant of the Hessian as the saliency measure. Computations are speeded-up further through the use of approximative box-filter operations on an integral video structure. A quantitative evaluation and experimental results on action recognition show the strengths of the proposed detector in terms of repeatability, accuracy and speed, in comparison with previously proposed detectors."

Human actions are frequently constrained by the purpose and the physical properties of scenes and demonstrate high correlation with particular scene classes. For example, eating often happens in a kitchen while running is more common outdoors. The contribution of this paper is three-fold: (a) we automatically discover relevant scene classes and their correlation with human actions, (b) we show how to learn selected scene classes from video without manual supervision and (c) we develop a joint framework for action and scene recognition and demonstrate improved recognition of both in natural video. We use movie scripts as a means of automatic supervision for training. For selected action classes we identify correlated scene classes in text and then retrieve video samples of actions and scenes for training using script-to-video alignment. Our visual models for scenes and actions are formulated within the bag-of-features framework and are combined in a joint scene-action SVM-based classifier. We report experimental results and validate the method on a new large dataset with twelve action classes and ten scene classes acquired from 69 movies."

A video sequence is represented by a bag of spatiotemporal features called video-words by quantizing the extracted 3D interest points (cuboids) from the videos. Our proposed approach is able to automatically discover the optimal number of video-word clusters by utilizing maximization of mutual information(MMI). Unlike the k-means algorithm, which is typically used to cluster spatiotemporal cuboids into video words based on their appearance similarity, MMI clustering further groups the video-words, which are highly correlated to some group of actions. To capture the structural information of the learnt optimal video-word clusters, we explore the correlation of the compact video-word clusters. We use the modified correlogram, which is not only translation and rotation invariant, but also somewhat scale invariant. We extensively test our proposed approach on two publicly available challenging datasets: the KTH dataset and IXMAS multiview dataset. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to try the bag of video-words related approach on the multiview dataset. We have obtained very impressive results on both datasets."

We propose to extend the notion of spatial interest points into the spatio-temporal domain and show how the resulting features often reflect interesting events that can be used for a compact representation of video data as well as for its interpretation. To detect spatio-temporal events, we build on the idea of the Harris and Forstner interest point operators and detect local structures in space-time where the image values have significant local variations in both space and time. We then estimate the spatio-temporal extents of the detected events and compute their scale-invariant spatio-temporal descriptors. Using such descriptors, we classify events and construct video representation in terms of labeled space-time points. For the problem of human motion analysis, we illustrate how the proposed method allows for detection of walking people in scenes with occlusions and dynamic backgrounds."

We regard human actions as three-dimensional shapes induced by the silhouettes in the space-time volume. We adopt a recent approach by Gorelick et al. (2004) for analyzing 2D shapes and generalize it to deal with volumetric space-time action shapes. Our method utilizes properties of the solution to the Poisson equation to extract space-time features such as local space-time saliency, action dynamics, shape structure and orientation. We show that these features are useful for action recognition, detection and clustering. The method is fast, does not require video alignment and is applicable in (but not limited to) many scenarios where the background is known. Moreover, we demonstrate the robustness of our method to partial occlusions, non-rigid deformations, significant changes in scale and viewpoint, high irregularities in the performance of an action and low quality video"

The spatiotemporal salient points are detected by measuring the variations in the information content of pixel neighborhoods not only in space but also in time. An appropriate distance metric between two collections of spatiotemporal salient points is introduced, which is based on the chamfer distance and an iterative linear time-warping technique that deals with time expansion or time-compression issues. A classification scheme that is based on relevance vector machines and on the proposed distance measure is proposed. Results on real image sequences from a small database depicting people performing 19 aerobic exercises are presented."

Our approach is based on a maximum average correlation height (MACH) filter. A common limitation of template-based methods is their inability to generate a single template using a collection of examples. MACH is capable of capturing intra-class variability by synthesizing a single Action MACH filter for a given action class. We generalize the traditional MACH filter to video (3D spatiotemporal volume), and vector valued data. By analyzing the response of the filter in the frequency domain, we avoid the high computational cost commonly incurred in template-based approaches. Vector valued data is analyzed using the Clifford Fourier transform, a generalization of the Fourier transform intended for both scalar and vector-valued data. Finally, we perform an extensive set of experiments and compare our method with some of the most recent approaches in the field by using publicly available datasets, and two new annotated human action datasets which include actions performed in classic feature films and sports broadcast television."

This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms) of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Mover\u2019s Distance and the \u03c72 distance. We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class variations and substantial background clutter."

The use of such features makes the problem more manageable while providing increased robustness to noise and pose variation. In this work we develop an extension of these ideas to the spatio-temporal case. For this purpose, we show that the direct 3D counterparts to commonly used 2D interest point detectors are inadequate, and we propose an alternative. Anchoring off of these interest points, we devise a recognition algorithm based on spatio-temporally windowed data. We present recognition results on a variety of datasets including both human and rodent behavior."

The approach builds on recent work on object recognition based on hierarchical feedforward architectures [25, 16, 20] and extends a neurobiological model of motion processing in the visual cortex [10]. The system consists of a hierarchy of spatio-temporal feature detectors of increasing complexity: an input sequence is first analyzed by an array of motion- direction sensitive units which, through a hierarchy of processing stages, lead to position-invariant spatio-temporal feature detectors. We experiment with different types of motion-direction sensitive units as well as different system architectures. As in [16], we find that sparse features in intermediate stages outperform dense ones and that using a simple feature selection approach leads to an efficient system that performs better with far fewer features. We test the approach on different publicly available action datasets, in all cases achieving the highest results reported to date."

(ii) We propose a generic 3D orientation quantization which is based on regular polyhedrons.

Current local feature extraction approaches involve either local filtering or entropy computation which ignore global information (e.g. large blobs of moving pixels) in video inputs. This paper presents a novel extraction method which utilises global information from each video input so that moving parts such as a moving hand can be identified and are used to select relevant interest points for a condensed representation. The proposed method involves obtaining a small set of subspace images, which can synthesise frames in the video input from their corresponding coefficient vectors, and then detecting interest points from the subspaces and the coefficient vectors. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can yield a sparser set of interest points for motion recognition than existing methods."

                "text": "The fact that objects in the world appear in different ways depending on the scale of observation has important implications if one aims at describing them. It shows that the notion of scale is of utmost importance when processing unknown measurement data by automatic methods. In their seminal works, Witkin (1983) and Koenderink (1984) proposed to approach this problem by representing image structures at different scales in a so-called scale-space representation. Traditional scale-space theory building on this work, however, does not address the problem of how to select local appropriate scales for further analysis. This article proposes a systematic methodology for dealing with this problem. A framework is presented for generating hypotheses about interesting scale levels in image data, based on a general principle stating that local extrema over scales of different combinations of \u03b3-normalized derivatives are likely candidates to correspond to interesting structures. Specifically, it is shown how this idea can be used as a major mechanism in algorithms for automatic scale selection, which adapt the local scales of processing to the local image structure.Support for the proposed approach is given in terms of a general theoretical investigation of the behaviour of the scale selection method under rescalings of the input pattern and by integration with different types of early visual modules, including experiments on real-world and synthetic data. Support is also given by a detailed analysis of how different types of feature detectors perform when integrated with a scale selection mechanism and then applied to characteristic model patterns. Specifically, it is described in detail how the proposed methodology applies to the problems of blob detection, junction detection, edge detection, ridge detection and local frequency estimation.In many computer vision applications, the poor performance of the low-level vision modules constitutes a major bottleneck. It is argued that the inclusion of mechanisms for automatic scale selection is essential if we are to construct vision systems to automatically analyse complex unknown environments."

Codebooks are usually constructed by using a method such as k-means to cluster the descriptor vectors of patches sampled either densely ('textons') or sparsely ('bags of features' based on key-points or salience measures) from a set of training images. This works well for texture analysis in homogeneous images, but the images that arise in natural object recognition tasks have far less uniform statistics. We show that for dense sampling, k-means over-adapts to this, clustering centres almost exclusively around the densest few regions in descriptor space and thus failing to code other informative regions. This gives suboptimal codes that are no better than using randomly selected centres. We describe a scalable acceptance-radius based clusterer that generates better codebooks and study its performance on several image classification tasks. We also show that dense representations outperform equivalent keypoint based ones on these tasks and that SVM or mutual information based feature selection starting from a dense codebook further improves the performance."

Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

For example, we desire to obtain an understanding of natural scenes, containing roads, buildings, trees, bushes, etc., as typified by the two frames from a sequence illustrated in Figure 1. The solution to this problem that we are pursuing is to use a computer vision system based upon motion analysis of a monocular image sequence from a mobile camera. By extraction and tracking of image features, representations of the 3D analogues of these features can be constructed."
