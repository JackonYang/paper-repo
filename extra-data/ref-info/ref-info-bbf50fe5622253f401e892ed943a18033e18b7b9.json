With the rapid growth in research over the last few years on recognizing text in natural scenes, there is an urgent need to establish some common benchmark datasets and gain a clear understanding of the current state of the art. We use the term \u2018robust reading\u2019 to refer to text images that are beyond the capabilities of current commercial OCR packages. We chose to break down the robust reading problem into three subproblems and run competitions for each stage, and also a competition for the best overall system. The subproblems we chose were text locating, character recognition and word recognition. By breaking down the problem in this way, we hoped to gain a better understanding of the state of the art in each of the subproblems. Furthermore, our methodology involved storing detailed results of applying each algorithm to each image in the datasets, allowing researchers to study in depth the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. The text-locating contest was the only one to have any entries. We give a brief description of each entry and present the results of this contest, showing cases where the leading entries succeed and fail. We also describe an algorithm for combining the outputs of the individual text locators and show how the combination scheme improves on any of the individual systems."

The similarity obtained by these approaches does not always correspond to the similarity a human user would expect. A way to include more semantic knowledge into the indexing process is to use the text included in the images and video sequences. It is rich in information but easy to use, e.g. by key word based queries. In this paper we present an algorithm to localize artificial text in images and videos using a measure of accumulated gradients and morphological post processing to detect the text. The quality of the localized text is improved by robust multiple frame integration. Anew technique for the binarization of the text boxes is proposed. Finally, detection and OCR results for a commercial OCR are presented."

                "text": "There are many applications in which the automatic detection and recognition of text embedded in images is useful. These applications include digad libraries, multimedia systems, and Geographical Information Systems. When machine generated text is prdnted against clean backgrounds, it can be converted to a computer readable form (ASCII) using current Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. However, text is often printed against shaded or textured backgrounds or is embedded in images. Examples include maps, advertisements, photographs, videos and stock certificates. Current document segmentation and recognition technologies cannot handle these situafons well. In this paper, a four-step system which automaticnlly detects and extracts text in images i& proposed. First, a texture segmentation scheme is used to focus attention on regions where text may occur. Second, strokes are extracted from the segmented text regions. Using reasonable heuristics on text strings such as height similarity, spacing and alignment, the extracted strokes are then processed to form rectangular boxes surrounding the corresponding ttzt strings. To detect text over a wide range of font sizes, the above steps are first applied to a pyramid of images generated from the input image, and then the boxes formed at each resolution level of the pyramid are fused at the image in the original resolution level. Third, text is extracted by cleaning up the background and binarizing the detected ted strings. Finally, better text bounding boxes are generated by srsiny the binarized text as strokes. Text is then cleaned and binarized from these new boxes, and can then be passed through a commercial OCR engine for recognition if the text is of an OCR-recognizable font. The system is stable, robust, and works well on imayes (with or without structured layouts) from a wide van\u2019ety of sources, including digitized video frames, photographs, *This material is based on work supported in part by the National Science Foundation, Library of Congress and Department of Commerce under cooperative agreement number EEC9209623, in part by the United States Patent and mademark Office and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency/IT0 under ARPA order number D468, issued by ESC/AXS contract number F19628-96-C-0235, in part by the National Science Foundation under grant number IF&9619117 and in part by NSF Multimedia CDA-9502639.

Instead of using binary information as most other OCR systems do, we extract features from intensity of an image directly. We utilize a local intensity normalization method to effectively handle lighting variations. We then employ Gabor transform to obtain local features, and use the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for selection and classification of features. The proposed method has been applied to a Chinese sign recognition task. The system can recognize a vocabulary of 3755 level I Chinese characters in the Chinese national standard character set GB2312-80 with various print fonts. We tested the system on 1630 test characters in sign images captured from the natural scenes, and the recognition accuracy was 92.46%. We have integrated the system into our automatic Chinese sign translation system."

Binarization of scanned gray scale images is the first step in most document image analysis systems. Selection of an appropriate binarization method for an input image domain is a difficult problem. Typically, a human expert evaluates the binarized images according to his/her visual criteria. However, to conduct an objective evaluation, one needs to investigate how well the subsequent image analysis steps will perform on the binarized image. We call this approach goal-directed evaluation, and it can be used to evaluate other low-level image processing methods as well. Our evaluation of binarization methods is in the context of digit recognition, so we define the performance of the character recognition module as the objective measure. Eleven different locally adaptive binarization methods were evaluated, and Niblack's method gave the best performance."

But existing design criteria for cascades either ignore the time complexity of the tests or make over-simplified assumptions about them. This paper gives a criterion for designing a time-efficient cascade that explicitly takes into account the time complexity of tests (as evaluated by computer run time) including the time for pre-processing. We design a greedy algorithm to minimize this criterion (noting that the full problem is NP-complete). Finally, we illustrate our method on the task of text detection in city scenes. This gives a text detection algorithm that runs at 0.025 seconds per 320\u00d7240 image, which is equivalent to 40 frames per second. This is a speed up factor of 2.5 compared to our previous text detector. It gives a realtime system which can be used for applications to help the blind and visually impaired."
