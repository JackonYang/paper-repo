Results indicate that it is possible to obtain around 50% reduction of perplexity by using mixture of several RNN LMs, compared to a state of the art backoff language model. Speech recognition experiments show around 18% reduction of word error rate on the Wall Street Journal task when comparing models trained on the same amount of data, and around 5% on the much harder NIST RT05 task, even when the backoff model is trained on much more data than the RNN LM. We provide ample empirical evidence to suggest that connectionist language models are superior to standard n-gram techniques, except their high computational (training) complexity.

This model is able to handle vocabularies of arbitrary size, hence dispensing with the design of short-lists that are commonly used in NNLMs. Several softmax layers replace the standard output layer in this model. The output structure depends on the word clustering which uses the continuous word representation induced by a NNLM. The GALE Mandarin data was used to carry out the speech-to-text experiments and evaluate the NNLMs. On this data the well tuned baseline system has a character error rate under 10%. Our model achieves consistent improvements over the combination of an n-gram model and classical short-list NNLMs both in terms of perplexity and recognition accuracy."

This paper investigates the potential of language models using larger context windows comprising up to the 9 previous words. This study is made possible by the development of several novel Neural Network Language Model architectures, which can easily fare with such large context windows. We experimentally observed that extending the context size yields clear gains in terms of perplexity and that the n-gram assumption is statistically reasonable as long as n is sufficiently high, and that efforts should be focused on improving the estimation procedures for such large models."

In this work, we show approaches that lead to more than 15 times speedup for both training and testing phases. Next, we show importance of using a backpropagation through time algorithm. An empirical comparison with feedforward networks is also provided. In the end, we discuss possibilities how to reduce the amount of parameters in the model. The resulting RNN model can thus be smaller, faster both during training and testing, and more accurate than the basic one."

However, it faces the data sparseness problem because of the large dimensionality and diversity of the information available in the syntactic parsing. Previously, we proposed using neural network models for the SLM (Emami, A. et al., Proc. ICASSP, 2003; Emami, Proc. EUROSPEECH'03., 2003). The neural network model is better suited to tackle the data sparseness problem and its use gave significant improvements in perplexity and word error rate over the baseline SLM. We present a new method of training the neural net based SLM. This procedure makes use of the partial parsing hypothesized by the SLM itself, and is more expensive than the approximate training method used previously. Experiments with the new training method on the UPenn and WSJ corpora show significant reductions in perplexity and word error rate, achieving the lowest published results for the given corpora."

Traditional techniques for estimating these models are based on N gram counts. Despite known weaknesses of N -grams and huge efforts of research communities across many fields (speech recognition, machine translation, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, data compression, psychology etc.), N -grams remained basically the state-of-the-art. The goal of this thesis is to present various architectures of language models that are based on artificial neural networks. Although these models are computationally more expensive than N -gram models, with the presented techniques it is possible to apply them to state-of-the-art systems efficiently. Achieved reductions of word error rate of speech recognition systems are up to 20%, against stateof-the-art N -gram model. The presented recurrent neural network based model achieves the best published performance on well-known Penn Treebank setup.

In this work, we show how this relationship can be used to motivate two heuristics for \"shrinking\" the size of a language model to improve its performance. We use the first heuristic to develop a novel class-based language model that outperforms a baseline word trigram model by 28% in perplexity and 1.9% absolute in speech recognition word-error rate on Wall Street Journal data. We use the second heuristic to motivate a regularized version of minimum discrimination information models and show that this method outperforms other techniques for domain adaptation."

In addition, we describe a bi-level inference and classification method that allows topic clustering at the utterance level while preserving the document-level topic structures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed topic clustering pipeline in a state-of-the-art Arabic broadcast transcription system. Experiments show that optimizing LM in the LDA topic space leads to 5% reduction in language model perplexity. It is further shown that topic clustering and adaptation is able to attain 0.4% absolute word error rate reduction on the GALE Arabic task."

Since the possible strings may be acoustically similar, a language model is required; given a word string, the model returns its linguistic probability. Several Markov language models are discussed. A novel kind of language model which reflects short-term patterns of word use by means of a cache component (analogous to cache memory in hardware terminology) is presented. The model also contains a 3g-gram component of the traditional type. The combined model and a pure 3g-gram model were tested on samples drawn from the Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen (LOB) corpus of English text. The relative performance of the two models is examined, and suggestions for the future improvements are made. >"

These dependencies or constraints are integrated using the maximum entropy technique. Substantial improvements are demonstrated over a trigram model in both perplexity and speech recognition accuracy on the Switchboard task. A detailed analysis of the performance of this language model is provided in order to characterize the manner in which it performs better than a standard N -gram model. It is shown that topic dependencies are most useful in predicting words which are semantically related by the subject matter of the conversation. Syntactic dependencies on the other hand are found to be most helpful in positions where the best predictors of the following word are not within N -gram range due to an intervening phrase or clause. It is also shown that these two methods individually enhance an N -gram model in complementary ways and the overall improvement from their combination is nearly additive."

The new model is conceptually simpler, and more naturally suited to modeling whole-sentence phenomena, than the conditional ME models proposed to date. By avoiding the chain rule, the model treats each sentence or utterance as a \"bag of features\", where features are arbitrary computable properties of the sentence. The model is unnormalizable, but this does not interfere with training (done via sampling) or with use. Using the model is computationally straightforward. The main computational cost of training the model is in generating sample sentences from a Gibbs distribution. Interestingly, this cost has different dependencies, and is potentially lower than in the comparable conditional ME model."

This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts."

We propose three new probabilistic language models that define the distribution of the next word in a sequence given several preceding words by using distributed representations of those words. We show how real-valued distributed representations for words can be learned at the same time as learning a large set of stochastic binary hidden features that are used to predict the distributed representation of the next word from previous distributed representations. Adding connections from the previous states of the binary hidden features improves performance as does adding direct connections between the real-valued distributed representations. One of our models significantly outperforms the very best n-gram models."

In this paper, we investigate a new statistical language model that captures topic-related dependencies of words within and across sentences. First, we develop a topic-dependent, sentence-level mixture language model which takes advantage of the topic constraints in a sentence or article. Second, we introduce topic-dependent dynamic adaptation techniques in the framework of the mixture model, using n-gram caches and content word unigram caches. Experiments with the static (or unadapted) mixture model on the North American Business (NAB) task show a 21% reduction in perplexity and a 3-4% improvement in recognition accuracy over a general n-gram model, giving a larger gain than that obtained with supervised dynamic cache modeling. Further experiments on the Switchboard corpus also showed a small improvement in performance with the sentence-level mixture model. Cache modeling techniques introduced in the mixture framework contributed a further 14% reduction in perplexity and a small improvement in recognition accuracy on the NAB task for both supervised and unsupervised adaptation."

Unlike traditional discriminative training methods that require transcribed speech, only untranscribed speech and a large text corpus is required. An exponential form is assumed for the language model, as done in maximum entropy estimation, but the model is trained from the text using a discriminative criterion that targets word confusions actually witnessed in first-pass ASR output lattices. Specifically, model parameters are estimated to maximize the likelihood ratio between words w in the text corpus and w's cohorts in the test speech, i.e. other words that w competes with in the test lattices. Empirical results are presented to demonstrate statistically significant improvements over a 4-gram language model on a large vocabulary ASR task."

Utilizing recent advances in the Hessian-free optimization approach (Martens, 2010), together with a novel damping scheme, we successfully train RNNs on two sets of challenging problems. First, a collection of pathological synthetic datasets which are known to be impossible for standard optimization approaches (due to their extremely long-term dependencies), and second, on three natural and highly complex real-world sequence datasets where we find that our method significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method for training neural sequence models: the Long Short-term Memory approach of Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997). Additionally, we offer a new interpretation of the generalized Gauss-Newton matrix of Schraudolph (2002) which is used within the HF approach of Martens."

We build models over varying domains, data set sizes, and n-gram orders, and perform linear regression to see whether we can model test set performance as a simple function of training set performance and various model statistics. Remarkably, we find a simple relationship that predicts test set performance with a correlation of 0.9997. We analyze why this relationship holds and show that it holds for other exponential language models as well, including class-based models and minimum discrimination information models.

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms."

                "text": "Statistical language models used in large-vocabulary speech recognition must properly encapsulate the various constraints, both local and global, present in the language. While local constraints are readily captured through n-gram modeling, global constraints, such as long-term semantic dependencies, have been more difficult to handle within a data-driven formalism. This paper focuses on the use of latent semantic analysis, a paradigm that automatically uncovers the salient semantic relationships between words and documents in a given corpus. In this approach, (discrete) words and documents are mapped onto a (continuous) semantic vector space, in which familiar clustering techniques can be applied. This leads to the specification of a powerful framework for automatic semantic classification, as well as the derivation of several language model families with various smoothing properties. Because of their large-span nature, these language models are well suited to complement conventional n-grams. An integrative formulation is proposed for harnessing this synergy, in which the latent semantic information is used to adjust the standard n-gram probability. Such hybrid language modeling compares favorably with the corresponding n-gram baseline: experiments conducted on the Wall Street Journal domain show a reduction in average word error rate of over 20%. This paper concludes with a discussion of intrinsic tradeoffs, such as the influence of training data selection on the resulting performance."

We use discriminative language models (DLMs) as a complementary approach to the conventional n-gram language models to benefit from discriminatively trained parameter estimates for overlapping features. In our DLM approach, relevant information is encoded as features. Feature weights are discriminatively trained using training examples and used to re-rank the N -best hypotheses of the baseline automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. In addition to presenting a more complete picture of previously proposed feature sets that extract implicit information available at lexical and sub-lexical levels using both linguistic and statistical approaches, this paper attempts to incorporate semantic information in the form of topic sensitive features. We explore linguistic features to incorporate complex morphological and syntactic language characteristics of Turkish, an agglutinative language with rich morphology, into language modeling. We also apply DLMs to our sub-lexical-based ASR system where the vocabulary is composed of sub-lexical units. Obtaining implicit linguistic information from sub-lexical hypotheses is not as straightforward as word hypotheses, so we use statistical methods to derive useful information from sub-lexical units. DLMs with linguistic and statistical features yield significant, 0.8%-1.1% absolute, improvements over our baseline word-based and sub-word-based ASR systems. The explored features can be easily extended to DLM for other languages ."

We show results obtained after combining all these models by using linear interpolation. We conclude that for both small and moderately sized tasks, we obtain new state of the art results with combination of models, that is significantly better than performance of any individual model. Obtained perplexity reductions against Good-Turing trigram baseline are over 50% and against modified Kneser-Ney smoothed 5-gram over 40%."

To extract information from the document history, trigger pairs are used as the basic information-bearing elements. To combine statistical evidence from multiple triggers, the principle of maximum entropy (ME) is used. To combine the trigger-based model with the static model, the latter is absorbed into the ME formalism. Given consistent statistical evidence, a unique ME solution is guaranteed to exist, and an iterative algorithm exists which is guaranteed to converge to it. Among the advantages of this approach are its simplicity, generality, and incremental nature. Among its disadvantages are its computational requirements. The model described here was trained on five million words of Wall Street Journal text. It used some 40000 unigram constraints, 200000 bigram constraints, 200000 trigram constraints, and 60000 trigger constraints. After 13 iterations, it produced a language model whose perplexity was 12% lower than that of a conventional trigram, as measured on independent data.<<ETX>>"

A new two-level segmental clustering approach is devised which combines the decision tree based state tying with agglomerative clustering of rare acoustic phonetic events. In addition, a unified maximum likelihood framework for incorporating both phonetic and nonphonetic features in decision tree based state tying is presented. In contrast to other heuristic data separation methods, which often lead to training data depletion, a tagging scheme is used to attach various features of interest and the selection of these features in the decision tree is data driven. Finally, two methods of using multiple-mixture parameterization to improve the quality of the evaluation function in decision tree state tying are described. One method is based on the approach of k-means fitting and the other method is based on a novel use of a local multilevel optimal subtree. Both methods provide more accurate likelihood evaluation in decision tree clustering and are consistent with the structure of the decision tree. Experimental results on Wall Street Journal corpora demonstrate that the proposed approaches lead to a significant improvement in model quality and recognition performance."
