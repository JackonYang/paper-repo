First we give a concise review of the literature with emphasis on the Baum-Welch algorithm. This is followed by a detailed discussion of three issues not treated in the literature: alternatives to the Baum-Welch algorithm; critical facets of the implementation of the algorithms, with emphasis on their numerical properties; and behavior of Markov models on certain artificial but realistic problems. Special attention is given to a particular class of Markov models, which we call \u201cleft-to-right\u201d models. This class of models is especially appropriate for isolated word recognition. The results of the application of these methods to an isolated word, speaker-independent speech recognition experiment are given in a companion paper."

                "text": "It is proposed that the learning of many tasks by the cerebrum is based on using a very few fundamental techniques for organizing information. It is argued that this is made possible by the prevalence in the world of a particular kind of redundancy, which is characterized by a \u2018Fundamental Hypothesis\u2019. This hypothesisis used to found a theory of the basic operations which, it is proposed, are carried out by the cerebral neocortex. They involve the use of past experience to form so-called \u2018classificatory units\u2019 with which to interpret subsequent experience. Such classificatory units are imagined to be created whenever either something occurs frequently in the brain\u2019s experience, or enough redundancy appears in the form of clusters of slightly differing inputs. A(non-Bayesian) information theoretic account is given of the diagnosis of an input as an instance of an existing classificatory unit, and of the interpretation as such of an incompletely specified input. Neural models are devised to implement the two operations of diagnosis and interpretation, and it is found that the performance of the second is an automatic consequence of the model\u2019s ability to perform the first. The discovery and formation of new classificatory units is discussed within the context of these neural models. It is shown how a climbing fibre input (of the kind described by Cajal) to the correct cell can cause that cell to perform a mountain-climbing operation in an underlying probability space, that will lead it to respond to a class of events for which it is appropriate to code. This is called the \u2018spatial recognizer effect\u2019. The structure of the cerebral neocortex is reviewed in the light of the model which the theory establishes. It is found that many elements in the cortex have a natural identification with elements in the model. This enables many predictions, with specified degrees of firmness, to be made concerning the connexions and synapses of the following cortical cells and fibres: Martinotti cells; cerebral granule cells; pyramidal cells of layers III, V and II; short axon cells of all layers, especially I, IV and VI; cerebral climbing fibres and those cells of the cortex which give rise to them; cerebral basket cells; fusiform cells of layers VI and VII. It is shown that if rather little information about the classificatory units to be formed has been coded genetically, it may be necessary to use a technique called codon formation to organize structure in a suitable way to represent a new unit. It is shown that under certain conditions, it is necessary to carry out a part of this organization during sleep. A prediction is made about the effect of sleep on learning of a certain kind."

The database contains speech from a group of speakers recorded over six months under a range of controlled conditions. In this respect the database provides a unique facility for two key areas in automatic speech recognition: assessment and advanced algorithm research. In the area of assessment, it is hoped that the database can be used to provide a much needed standard calibrated test for automatic speech recognition equipment. At the same time, in the area of algorithm research, the minimally contrasting pairs of rhyming words in the database make the recordings particularly applicable to the development of advanced speech recognition algorithms.

The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing.

It is shown that rather general numerical constraints roughly determine the dimensions of memorizing models for the mammalian brain, and from these is derived a general model for archicortex. The addition of further constraints leads to the notion of a simple representation, which is a way of translating a great deal of information into the firing of about 200 out of a population of 10 $^5$ cells. It is shown that if about 10 $^5$ simple representations are stored in such a population of cells, very little information about a single learnt event is necessary to provoke its recall. A detailed numerical examination is made of a particular example of this kind of memory, and various general conclusions are drawn from the analysis. The insight gained from these models is used to derive theories for various archicortical areas. A functional interpretation is given of the cells and synapses of the area entorhinalis, the prcsubiculum, the prosubiculum, the cornu ammonis and the fascia dentata. Many predictions are made, a substantial number of which must be true if the theory is correct. A general functional classification of typical archicortical cells is proposed."

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios."
