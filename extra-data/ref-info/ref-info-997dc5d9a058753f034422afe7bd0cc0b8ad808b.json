The design and operational features of this system are described. Experiments on 70 subjects during a four-week period show a 2.9 percent rejection of valid signatures and a 2.1 percent acceptance of forgeries. An average of 1.2 trials was necessary for verification. The forgers were knowledgeable about the verification technique and did their best to deceive the system. The acceptance rate of random forgeries, i.e., accidental matching of two separate signatures, was 0.16 percent."
