                "text": "The notion of using context information for solving high-level vision problems has been increasingly realized in the field. However, how to learn an effective and efficient context model, together with the image appearance, remains mostly unknown. The current literature using Markov random fields (MRFs) and conditional random fields (CRFs) often involves specific algorithm design, in which the modeling and computing stages are studied in isolation. In this paper, we propose an auto-context algorithm. Given a set of training images and their corresponding label maps, we first learn a classifier on local image patches. The discriminative probability (or classification confidence) maps by the learned classifier are then used as context information, in addition to the original image patches, to train a new classifier. The algorithm then iterates to approach the ground truth. Auto-context learns an integrated low-level and context model, and is very general and easy to implement. Under nearly the identical parameter setting in the training, we apply the algorithm on three challenging vision applications: object segmentation, human body configuration, and scene region labeling. It typically takes about 30 ~ 70 seconds to run the algorithm in testing. Moreover, the scope of the proposed algorithm goes beyond high-level vision. It has the potential to be used for a wide variety of problems of multi-variate labeling."

In this work, we present our analysis on a standard dataset, using top-performing local appearance detectors as baseline. We evaluate several different sources of context and ways to utilize it. While we employ many contextual cues that have been used before, we also propose a few novel ones including the use of geographic context and a new approach for using object spatial support."

                "text": "Many state-of-the-art approaches for object recognition reduce the problem to a 0-1 classification task. This allows one to leverage sophisticated machine learning techniques for training classifiers from labeled examples. However, these models are typically trained independently for each class using positive and negative examples cropped from images. At test-time, various post-processing heuristics such as non-maxima suppression (NMS) are required to reconcile multiple detections within and between different classes for each image. Though crucial to good performance on benchmarks, this post-processing is usually defined heuristically.We introduce a unified model for multi-class object recognition that casts the problem as a structured prediction task. Rather than predicting a binary label for each image window independently, our model simultaneously predicts a structured labeling of the entire image (Fig.\u00a01). Our model learns statistics that capture the spatial arrangements of various object classes in real images, both in terms of which arrangements to suppress through NMS and which arrangements to favor through spatial co-occurrence statistics.We formulate parameter estimation in our model as a max-margin learning problem. Given training images with ground-truth object locations, we show how to formulate learning as a convex optimization problem. We employ the cutting plane algorithm of Joachims et al. (Mach. Learn.\u00a02009) to efficiently learn a model from thousands of training images. We show state-of-the-art results on the PASCAL VOC benchmark that indicate the benefits of learning a global model encapsulating the spatial layout of multiple object classes (a preliminary version of this work appeared in ICCV 2009, Desai et al., IEEE international conference on computer vision,\u00a02009)."

A context model can rule out some unlikely combinations or locations of objects and guide detectors to produce a semantically coherent interpretation of a scene. However, the performance benefit of context models has been limited because most of the previous methods were tested on data sets with only a few object categories, in which most images contain one or two object categories. In this paper, we introduce a new data set with images that contain many instances of different object categories, and propose an efficient model that captures the contextual information among more than a hundred object categories using a tree structure. Our model incorporates global image features, dependencies between object categories, and outputs of local detectors into one probabilistic framework. We demonstrate that our context model improves object recognition performance and provides a coherent interpretation of a scene, which enables a reliable image querying system by multiple object categories. In addition, our model can be applied to scene understanding tasks that local detectors alone cannot solve, such as detecting objects out of context or querying for the most typical and the least typical scenes in a data set."

Other types of objects of amorphous spatial extent (e.g., trees, sky), however, are more naturally classified based on texture or color. In this paper, we seek to combine recognition of these two types of objects into a system that leverages \"context\" toward improving detection. In particular, we cluster image regions based on their ability to serve as context for the detection of objects. Rather than providing an explicit training set with region labels, our method automatically groups regions based on both their appearance and their relationships to the detections in the image. We show that our things and stuff (TAS) context model produces meaningful clusters that are readily interpretable, and helps improve our detection ability over state-of-the-art detectors. We also present a method for learning the active set of relationships for a particular dataset. We present results on object detection in images from the PASCAL VOC 2005/2006 datasets and on the task of overhead car detection in satellite images, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art detectors."

First, it encodes both the short-range interactions (e.g., pixelwise label smoothing) as well as the long-range interactions (e.g., relative configurations of objects or regions) in a tractable manner. Second, the formulation is general enough to be applied to different domains ranging from pixelwise image labeling to contextual object detection. The parameters of the model are learned using a sequential maximum-likelihood approximation. The benefits of the proposed framework are demonstrated on four different datasets and comparison results are presented"

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL data sets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI--SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semiconvex, and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function."

We first observed an interesting computational property of the object hierarchy: comparing the recognition rate when using models of objects at different levels, the higher more inclusive levels (e.g., closed-frame vehicles or vehicles) exhibit higher recall but lower precision when compared with the class specific level (e.g., bus). These inherent differences suggest that combining object classifiers from different hierarchical levels into a single classifier may improve classification, as it appears like these models capture different aspects of the object. We describe a method to combine these classifiers, and analyze the conditions under which improvement can be guaranteed. When given a small sample of a new object class, we describe a method to transfer knowledge across the tree hierarchy, between related objects. Finally, we describe extensive experiments using object hierarchies obtained from publicly available datasets, and show that the combined classifiers significantly improve recognition results."

Context models can efficiently rule out some unlikely combinations or locations of objects and guide detectors to produce a semantically coherent interpretation of a scene. However, the performance benefit from using context models has been limited because most of these methods were tested on datasets with only a few object categories, in which most images contain only one or two object categories. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset with images that contain many instances of different object categories and propose an efficient model that captures the contextual information among more than a hundred of object categories. We show that our context model can be applied to scene understanding tasks that local detectors alone cannot solve."

An object is represented by a mixture of hierarchical tree models where the nodes represent object parts. The nodes can move spatially to allow both local and global shape deformations. The models can be trained discriminatively using latent structural SVM learning, where the latent variables are the node positions and the mixture component. But current learning methods are slow, due to the large number of parameters and latent variables, and have been restricted to hierarchies with two layers. In this paper we describe an incremental concave-convex procedure (iCCCP) which allows us to learn both two and three layer models efficiently. We show that iCCCP leads to a simple training algorithm which avoids complex multi-stage layer-wise training, careful part selection, and achieves good performance without requiring elaborate initialization. We perform object detection using our learnt models and obtain performance comparable with state-of-the-art methods when evaluated on challenging public PASCAL datasets. We demonstrate the advantages of three layer hierarchies - outperforming Felzenszwalb et al.'s two layer models on all 20 classes."

In designing object recognition systems, it is necessary to understand the theoretical and practical properties of such approaches.

Given a set of images and their associated text (e.g. keywords, captions, descriptions), the objective is to segment an image, in either a crude or sophisticated fashion, then to find the proper associations between words and regions. Previous models are limited by the scope of the representation. In particular, they fail to exploit spatial context in the images and words. We develop a more expressive model that takes this into account. We formulate a spatially consistent probabilistic mapping between continuous image feature vectors and the supplied word tokens. By learning both word-to-region associations and object relations, the proposed model augments scene segmentations due to smoothing implicit in spatial consistency. Context introduces cycles to the undirected graph, so we cannot rely on a straightforward implementation of the EM algorithm for estimating the model parameters and densities of the unknown alignment variables. Instead, we develop an approximate EM algorithm that uses loopy belief propagation in the inference step and iterative scaling on the pseudo-likelihood approximation in the parameter update step. The experiments indicate that our approximate inference and learning algorithm converges to good local solutions. Experiments on a diverse array of images show that spatial context considerably improves the accuracy of object recognition. Most significantly, spatial context combined with a nonlinear discrete object representation allows our models to cope well with over-segmented scenes."

A binary classifier can be learned from manually labeled images; while using more labeled examples improves performance, obtaining the image labels is a time consuming process. We are interested in how other sources of information can aid the learning process given a fixed amount of labeled images. In particular, we consider a scenario where keywords are associated with the training images, e.g. as found on photo sharing websites. The goal is to learn a classifier for images alone, but we will use the keywords associated with labeled and unlabeled images to improve the classifier using semi-supervised learning. We first learn a strong Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) classifier using both the image content and keywords, and use it to score unlabeled images. We then learn classifiers on visual features only, either support vector machines (SVM) or least-squares regression (LSR), from the MKL output values on both the labeled and unlabeled images. In our experiments on 20 classes from the PASCAL VOC'07 set and 38 from the MIR Flickr set, we demonstrate the benefit of our semi-supervised approach over only using the labeled images. We also present results for a scenario where we do not use any manual labeling but directly learn classifiers from the image tags. The semi-supervised approach also improves classification accuracy in this case."

The context-feature is simple to implement, feed-forward, and effective across multiple object types in a street-scenes environment.Using context alone, we demonstrate robust detection of locations likely to contain bicycles, cars, and pedestrians. Furthermore, experiments are conducted so as to address several open questions regarding visual context. Specifically, it is demonstrated that context may be determined from low level visual features (simple color and texture descriptors) sampled over a wide receptive field. At least for the framework tested, high level semantic knowledge, e.g, the nature of the surrounding objects, is superfluous. Finally, it is shown that when the target object is unambiguously visible, context is only marginally useful."

In the context of image classification the FK was shown to extend the popular bag-of-visual-words (BOV) by going beyond count statistics. However, in practice, this enriched representation has not yet shown its superiority over the BOV. In the first part we show that with several well-motivated modifications over the original framework we can boost the accuracy of the FK. On PASCAL VOC 2007 we increase the Average Precision (AP) from 47.9% to 58.3%. Similarly, we demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on CalTech 256. A major advantage is that these results are obtained using only SIFT descriptors and costless linear classifiers. Equipped with this representation, we can now explore image classification on a larger scale. In the second part, as an application, we compare two abundant resources of labeled images to learn classifiers: ImageNet and Flickr groups. In an evaluation involving hundreds of thousands of training images we show that classifiers learned on Flickr groups perform surprisingly well (although they were not intended for this purpose) and that they can complement classifiers learned on more carefully annotated datasets."

We submitted two recognition methods sharing the same underlying image representations defined by a choice of image sampler, local descriptor and global spatial grid. The submitted methods also share the classifier, which is a one-against-rest non-linear Support Vector Machine with chi-square kernel. The methods differ in the way they combine multiple representations (channels). The first method is based on the approach of Zhang et al., where the final similarity measure is the sum of per-channel similarities. The second method employs a genetic algorithm, which is used to determine (on per-class basis) the parameters of the generalized RBF kernel incorporating all the channels, i.e., to estimate the importance of each sampling/description/spatial method for the recognition and to optimize the required level of generalization. Both methods showed superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art submissions."

We review the state-of-the-art in evaluated methods for both classification and detection, analyse whether the methods are statistically different, what they are learning from the images (e.g. the object or its context), and what the methods find easy or confuse. The paper concludes with lessons learnt in the three year history of the challenge, and proposes directions for future improvement and extension."

These are ensembles of decision trees that act directly on image pixels, and therefore do not need the expensive computation of filter-bank responses or local descriptors. They are extremely fast to both train and test, especially compared with k-means clustering and nearest-neighbor assignment of feature descriptors. The nodes in the trees provide (i) an implicit hierarchical clustering into semantic textons, and (ii) an explicit local classification estimate. Our second contribution, the bag of semantic textons, combines a histogram of semantic textons over an image region with a region prior category distribution. The bag of semantic textons is computed over the whole image for categorization, and over local rectangular regions for segmentation. Including both histogram and region prior allows our segmentation algorithm to exploit both textural and semantic context. Our third contribution is an image-level prior for segmentation that emphasizes those categories that the automatic categorization believes to be present. We evaluate on two datasets including the very challenging VOC 2007 segmentation dataset. Our results significantly advance the state-of-the-art in segmentation accuracy, and furthermore, our use of efficient decision forests gives at least a five-fold increase in execution speed."

Our experimental evaluation shows that ranking based algorithms do not outperform a one-vs-rest strategy and that the gap between the different algorithms reduces in case of high-dimensional data. We also show that for one-vs-rest, learning through cross-validation the optimal degree of imbalance between the positive and the negative samples can have a significant impact. Furthermore, early stopping can be used as an effective regularization strategy when training with stochastic gradient algorithms. Following these \"good practices\", we were able to improve the state-of-the-art on a large subset of 10K classes and 9M of images of lmageNet from 16.7% accuracy to 19.1%."

Most current object detection methods focus on improving accuracy of large-scale object detection with efficiency being an afterthought. In this paper, we present the Efficient Maximum Appearance Search (EMAS) model which is an order of magnitude faster than the existing state-of-the-art large-scale object detection approaches, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our EMAS model consists of representing an image as an ensemble of densely sampled feature points with the proposed Point wise Fisher Vector encoding method, so that the learnt discriminative scoring function can be applied locally. Consequently, the object detection problem is transformed into searching an image sub-area for maximum local appearance probability, thereby making EMAS an order of magnitude faster than the traditional detection methods. In addition, the proposed model is also suitable for incorporating global context at a negligible extra computational cost. EMAS can also incorporate fusion of multiple features, which greatly improves its performance in detecting multiple object categories. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm can perform detection of 1000 object classes in less than one minute per image on the Image Net ILSVRC2012 dataset and for 107 object classes in less than 5 seconds per image for the SUN09 dataset using a single CPU."

The original Caltech-101 [1] was collected by choosing a set of object categories, downloading examples from Google Images and then manually screening out all images that did not fit the category. Caltech-256 is collected in a similar manner with several improvements: a) the number of categories is more than doubled, b) the minimum number of images in any category is increased from 31 to 80, c) artifacts due to image rotation are avoided and d) a new and larger clutter category is introduced for testing background rejection. We suggest several testing paradigms to measure classification performance, then benchmark the dataset using two simple metrics as well as a state-of-the-art spatial pyramid matching [2] algorithm. Finally we use the clutter category to train an interest detector which rejects uninformative background regions."

Such data is useful for supervised learning and quantitative evaluation. To achieve this, we developed a web-based tool that allows easy image annotation and instant sharing of such annotations. Using this annotation tool, we have collected a large dataset that spans many object categories, often containing multiple instances over a wide variety of images. We quantify the contents of the dataset and compare against existing state of the art datasets used for object recognition and detection. Also, we show how to extend the dataset to automatically enhance object labels with WordNet, discover object parts, recover a depth ordering of objects in a scene, and increase the number of labels using minimal user supervision and images from the web.\n"

The difficulty is particularly pronounced in activities involving human-object interactions (e.g. playing tennis), where the relevant object tends to be small or only partially visible, and the human body parts are often self-occluded. We observe, however, that objects and human poses can serve as mutual context to each other \u2013 recognizing one facilitates the recognition of the other. In this paper we propose a new random field model to encode the mutual context of objects and human poses in human-object interaction activities. We then cast the model learning task as a structure learning problem, of which the structural connectivity between the object, the overall human pose, and different body parts are estimated through a structure search approach, and the parameters of the model are estimated by a new max-margin algorithm. On a sports data set of six classes of human-object interactions [12], we show that our mutual context model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art in detecting very difficult objects and human poses."

The core novel contribution is an approach that can exploit prior knowledge of a semantic hierarchy. When semantic labels and a hierarchy relating them are available during training, significant improvements over the state of the art in similar image retrieval are attained. While some of this advantage comes from the ability to use additional information, experiments exploring a special case where no additional data is provided, show the new approach can still outperform OASIS [6], the current state of the art for similarity learning. Exploiting hierarchical relationships is most important for larger scale problems, where scalability becomes crucial. The proposed learning approach is fundamentally parallelizable and as a result scales more easily than previous work. An additional contribution is a novel hashing scheme (for bilinear similarity on vectors of probabilities, optionally taking into account hierarchy) that is able to reduce the computational cost of retrieval. Experiments are performed on Caltech256 and the larger ImageNet dataset."

We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds."

So far, intensity-based descriptors have been widely used for feature extraction at salient points. To increase illumination invariance and discriminative power, color descriptors have been proposed. Because many different descriptors exist, a structured overview is required of color invariant descriptors in the context of image category recognition. Therefore, this paper studies the invariance properties and the distinctiveness of color descriptors (software to compute the color descriptors from this paper is available from http://www.colordescriptors.com) in a structured way. The analytical invariance properties of color descriptors are explored, using a taxonomy based on invariance properties with respect to photometric transformations, and tested experimentally using a data set with known illumination conditions. In addition, the distinctiveness of color descriptors is assessed experimentally using two benchmarks, one from the image domain and one from the video domain. From the theoretical and experimental results, it can be derived that invariance to light intensity changes and light color changes affects category recognition. The results further reveal that, for light intensity shifts, the usefulness of invariance is category-specific. Overall, when choosing a single descriptor and no prior knowledge about the data set and object and scene categories is available, the OpponentSIFT is recommended. Furthermore, a combined set of color descriptors outperforms intensity-based SIFT and improves category recognition by 8 percent on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and by 7 percent on the Mediamill Challenge."

Despite its popularity, these nonlinear SVMs have a complexity O(n2 ~ n3) in training and O(n) in testing, where n is the training size, implying that it is nontrivial to scaleup the algorithms to handle more than thousands of training images. In this paper we develop an extension of the SPM method, by generalizing vector quantization to sparse coding followed by multi-scale spatial max pooling, and propose a linear SPM kernel based on SIFT sparse codes. This new approach remarkably reduces the complexity of SVMs to O(n) in training and a constant in testing. In a number of image categorization experiments, we find that, in terms of classification accuracy, the suggested linear SPM based on sparse coding of SIFT descriptors always significantly outperforms the linear SPM kernel on histograms, and is even better than the nonlinear SPM kernels, leading to state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks by using a single type of descriptors."

Users prefer to ask for pictures using notions of content that are strongly oriented to the presence of abstractly defined objects. Computer programs that implement these queries automatically are desirable, but are hard to build because conventional object recognition techniques from computer vision cannot recognize very general objects in very general contexts. This paper describes our approach to object recognition, which is structured around a sequence of increasingly specialized grouping activities that assemble coherent regions of image that can be shown to satisfy increasingly stringent constraints. The constraints that are satisfied provide a form of object classification in quite general contexts. This view of recognition is distinguished by: far richer involvement of early visual primitives, including color and texture; hierarchical grouping and learning strategies in the classification process; the ability to deal with rather general objects in uncontrolled configurations and contexts. We illustrate these properties with four case-studies: one demonstrating the use of color and texture descriptors; one showing how trees can be described by fusing texture and geometric properties; one learning scenery concepts using grouped features; and one showing how this view of recognition yields a program that can tell, quite accurately, whether a picture contains naked people or not."

This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

Here we introduce a simple framework for modeling the relationship between context and object properties based on the correlation between the statistics of low-level features across the entire scene and the objects that it contains. The resulting scheme serves as an effective procedure for object priming, context driven focus of attention and automatic scale-selection on real-world scenes."

The images we classify depict animals in a wide range of aspects, configurations and appearances. In addition, the images typically portray multiple species that differ in appearance (e.g. ukari\u2019s, vervet monkeys, spider monkeys, rhesus monkeys, etc.). Our method is accurate despite this variation and relies on four simple cues: text, color, shape and texture. Visual cues are evaluated by a voting method that compares local image phenomena with a number of visual exemplars for the category. The visual exemplars are obtained using a clustering method applied to text on web pages. The only supervision required involves identifying which clusters of exemplars refer to which sense of a term (for example, \"monkey\" can refer to an animal or a bandmember). Because our method is applied to web pages with free text, the word cue is extremely noisy. We show unequivocal evidence that visual information improves performance for our task. Our method allows us to produce large, accurate and challenging visual datasets mostly automatically."

Many researchers have used this tool to examine the geophysical and climatological phenomena. Perhaps more frequent use of EOFs in recent studies is in conjunction with the development of the signal detection and estimation methods of the background uctuations of a detection variable serve as an orthogonal basis set and are used to design optimal techniques for detecting and estimating signals. A detection and prediction approach is to design a lter or optimal weights for the signal to be detected. It has been reported that weighted averaging of data over the surface of the Earth improved the detectability of climatic changes (Hasselmann 1979; Stefanick 1981; Bell 1982). Since the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) varies geographically, there exists an optimal geographical weighting of the signal which maximizes the SNR. The design of an optimal weighting function may require detailed knowledge on the natural uctuation of the climate system. A conceptually similar approach is to employ a particular pattern (or patterns) of climatic change for detection and prediction (e.g., Barnett and Hasselmann 1979; Hasselmann 1979). The patterns of interest (also called the predictors) may include the principal components (empirical orthogonal functions) (e. von Storch 1990) among others. This approach also requires complete knowledge of the natural variability of the climate system. To test and improve the detection and prediction techniques addressed above, a complete cross-spectral covariance matrix, or similarly, a complete set of the principal components of natural uctuations of the climate system for each frequency band of the spectrum is necessary. In reality, a reliable spectrum of observational covariance matrix is not available because observations are not suuciently long and sampling errors contaminate the observational records (Preisendorfer and Barnett 1977; North et al. 1982). Further, inadequate spatial coverage of observations may introduce bias. Therefore, the covariance matrix of the noise response is often estimated from a simple stochastic model. Kim and North (1991, 1992) examined the covariance matrix in terms of various second-moment statistics earlier. Examined here are the principal components of the covariance matrix of the surface temperature uctuations in a simple coupled climate model in comparison with observations. The principal components not only are an"

We generalize the theorem to a larger class of regularizers and empirical risk terms, and give a self-contained proof utilizing the feature space associated with a kernel. The result shows that a wide range of problems have optimal solutions that live in the finite dimensional span of the training examples mapped into feature space, thus enabling us to carry out kernel algorithms independent of the (potentially infinite) dimensionality of the feature space."
