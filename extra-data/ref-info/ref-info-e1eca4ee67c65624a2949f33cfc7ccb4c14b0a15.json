We develop a new model, TSI-pLSA, which extends pLSA (as applied to visual words) to include spatial information in a translation and scale invariant manner. Our approach can handle the high intra-class variability and large proportion of unrelated images returned by search engines. We evaluate tire models on standard test sets, showing performance competitive with existing methods trained on hand prepared datasets"

A vocabulary of information-rich object parts is automatically constructed from a set of sample images of the object class of interest. Images are then represented using parts from this vocabulary, along with spatial relations observed among them. Based on this representation, a feature-efficient learning algorithm is used to learn to detect instances of the object class. The framework developed can be applied to any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial configuration. We report experiments on images of side views of cars. Our experiments show that the method achieves high detection accuracy on a difficult test set of real-world images, and is highly robust to partial occlusion and background variation.In addition, we discuss and offer solutions to several methodological issues that are significant for the research community to be able to evaluate object detection approaches."

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals)."

While discriminative approaches to learning and classification have, in principle, superior performance, generative approaches provide many useful features, one of which is the ability to naturally establish explicit correspondence between model components and scene features - this, in turn, allows for the handling of missing data and unsupervised learning in clutter. We explore a hybrid generative/discriminative approach using 'Fisher kernels' by Jaakkola and Haussler (1999) which retains most of the desirable properties of generative methods, while increasing the classification performance through a discriminative setting. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this kernel framework can be used to combine different types of features and models into a single classifier. Our experiments, conducted on a number of popular benchmarks, show strong performance improvements over the corresponding generative approach and are competitive with the best results reported in the literature."

This technique works by partitioning the image into increasingly fine sub-regions and computing histograms of local features found inside each sub-region. The resulting \"spatial pyramid\" is a simple and computationally efficient extension of an orderless bag-of-features image representation, and it shows significantly improved performance on challenging scene categorization tasks. Specifically, our proposed method exceeds the state of the art on the Caltech-101 database and achieves high accuracy on a large database of fifteen natural scene categories. The spatial pyramid framework also offers insights into the success of several recently proposed image descriptions, including Torralba\u2019s \"gist\" and Lowe\u2019s SIFT descriptors."

Such data is useful for supervised learning and quantitative evaluation. To achieve this, we developed a web-based tool that allows easy image annotation and instant sharing of such annotations. Using this annotation tool, we have collected a large dataset that spans many object categories, often containing multiple instances over a wide variety of images. We quantify the contents of the dataset and compare against existing state of the art datasets used for object recognition and detection. Also, we show how to extend the dataset to automatically enhance object labels with WordNet, discover object parts, recover a depth ordering of objects in a scene, and increase the number of labels using minimal user supervision and images from the web.\n"

This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions (signatures or histograms) of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Mover's Distance and the chi-square distance. We first evaluate the performance of our approach with different keypoint detectors and descriptors, as well as different kernels and classifiers. We then conduct a comparative evaluation with several state-of-the-art recognition methods on four texture and five object databases. On most of these databases, our implementation exceeds the best reported results and achieves comparable performance on the rest. Finally, we investigate the influence of background correlations on recognition performance via extensive tests on the PASCAL database, for which ground-truth object localization information is available. Our experiments demonstrate that image representations based on distributions of local features are surprisingly effective for classification of texture and object images under challenging real-world conditions, including significant intra-class variations and substantial background clutter."

Our system's architecture is motivated by a quantitative model of visual cortex. We show that our approach exhibits excellent recognition performance and outperforms several state-of-the-art systems on a variety of image datasets including many different object categories. We also demonstrate that our system is able to learn from very few examples. The performance of the approach constitutes a suggestive plausibility proof for a class of feedforward models of object recognition in cortex."

We show that we can estimate the coarse geometric properties of a scene by learning appearance-based models of geometric classes, even in cluttered natural scenes. Geometric classes describe the 3D orientation of an image region with respect to the camera. We provide a multiple-hypothesis framework for robustly estimating scene structure from a single image and obtaining confidences for each geometric label. These confidences can then be used to improve the performance of many other applications. We provide a thorough quantitative evaluation of our algorithm on a set of outdoor images and demonstrate its usefulness in two applications: object detection and automatic single-view reconstruction."

This algorithm sets up correspondence as an integer quadratic programming problem, where the cost function has terms based on similarity of corresponding geometric blur point descriptors as well as the geometric distortion between pairs of corresponding feature points. The algorithm handles outliers, and thus enables matching of exemplars to query images in the presence of occlusion and clutter. Given the correspondences, we estimate an aligning transform, typically a regularized thin plate spline, resulting in a dense correspondence between the two shapes. Object recognition is then handled in a nearest neighbor framework where the distance between exemplar and query is the matching cost between corresponding points. We show results on two datasets. One is the Caltech 101 dataset (Fei-Fei, Fergus and Perona), an extremely challenging dataset with large intraclass variation. Our approach yields a 48% correct classification rate, compared to Fei-Fei et al 's 16%. We also show results for localizing frontal and profile faces that are comparable to special purpose approaches tuned to faces."

As in that work, we first apply Gabor filters at all positions and scales; feature complexity and position/scale invariance are then built up by alternating template matching and max pooling operations. We refine the approach in several biologically plausible ways, using simple versions of sparsification and lateral inhibition. We demonstrate the value of retaining some position and scale information above the intermediate feature level. Using feature selection we arrive at a model that performs better with fewer features. Our final model is tested on the Caltech 101 object categories and the UIUC car localization task, in both cases achieving state-of-the-art performance. The results strengthen the case for using this class of model in computer vision."

This approach is quite flexible, and permits recognition based on color, texture, and particularly shape, in a homogeneous framework. While nearest neighbor classifiers are natural in this setting, they suffer from the problem of high variance (in bias-variance decomposition) in the case of limited sampling. Alternatively, one could use support vector machines but they involve time-consuming optimization and computation of pairwise distances. We propose a hybrid of these two methods which deals naturally with the multiclass setting, has reasonable computational complexity both in training and at run time, and yields excellent results in practice. The basic idea is to find close neighbors to a query sample and train a local support vector machine that preserves the distance function on the collection of neighbors. Our method can be applied to large, multiclass data sets for which it outperforms nearest neighbor and support vector machines, and remains efficient when the problem becomes intractable for support vector machines. A wide variety of distance functions can be used and our experiments show state-of-the-art performance on a number of benchmark data sets for shape and texture classification (MNIST, USPS, CUReT) and object recognition (Caltech- 101). On Caltech-101 we achieved a correct classification rate of 59.05%(\u00b10.56%) at 15 training images per class, and 66.23%(\u00b10.48%) at 30 training images."

Compositions are learned from the Caltech 101 database and form intermediate abstractions of images that are semantically situated between low-level representations and the high-level categorization. Salient regions, which are described by localized feature histograms, are detected as image parts. Subsequently compositions are formed as bags of parts with a locality constraint. After performing a spatial binding of compositions by means of a shape model, coupled probabilistic kernel classifiers are applied thereupon to establish the final image categorization. In contrast to the discriminative training of the categorizer, intermediate compositions are learned in a generative manner yielding relevant part agglomerations, i.e. groupings which are frequently appearing in the dataset while simultaneously supporting the discrimination between sets of categories. Consequently, compositionality simplifies the learning of a complex categorization model for complete scenes by splitting it up into simpler, sharable compositions. The architecture is evaluated on the highly challenging Caltech 101 database which exhibits large intra-category variations. Our compositional approach shows competitive retrieval rates in the range of 53.6 \u00b1 0.88% or, with a multi-scale feature set, rates of 57.8 \u00b1 0.79%."

Kernel-based classification methods can learn complex decision boundaries, but a kernel over unordered set inputs must somehow solve for correspondences epsivnerally a computationally expensive task that becomes impractical for large set sizes. We present a new fast kernel function which maps unordered feature sets to multi-resolution histograms and computes a weighted histogram intersection in this space. This \"pyramid match\" computation is linear in the number of features, and it implicitly finds correspondences based on the finest resolution histogram cell where a matched pair first appears. Since the kernel does not penalize the presence of extra features, it is robust to clutter. We show the kernel function is positive-definite, making it valid for use in learning algorithms whose optimal solutions are guaranteed only for Mercer kernels. We demonstrate our algorithm on object recognition tasks and show it to be accurate and dramatically faster than current approaches"

The only dataset used by a large number of research groups are the Corel Photo CDs. There are more than 800 of those CDs, each containing 100 pictures roughly similar in theme. Unfortunately, basically every evaluation is done on a different subset of the image sets thus making comparison impossible.In this article, we compare different ways of evaluating the performance using a subset of the Corel images with the same CBIRSan d the same set of evaluation measures. The aim is to show how easy it is to get differing results, even when using the same image collection, the same CBIRS and the same performance measures. This pinpoints the fact that we need a standard database of images with a query set and corresponding relevance judgments (RJs) to really compare systems.The techniques used in this article to \"enhance\" the apparent performance of a CBIRSa re commonly used, sometimes described, sometimes not. They all have a justification and seem to change the performance of a CBIRS but they do actually not. With a larger subset of images it is of course much easier to generate even bigger differences in performance. The goal of this article is not to be a guide of how to make the \"apparent\" performance of systems look good, but rather to make readers aware of CBIRS evaluations and the importance of standardized image databases, queries and RJ."

Our main goal is to build a knowledge base associated with as many concepts as possible for large scale object recognition studies. A second goal is supporting the building of more accurate text-based indexes for Web images. In our method, good quality candidate sets of images for each keyword are gathered as a function of analysis of the surrounding HTML text. The gathered images are then segmented into regions, and a model for the probability distribution of regions for the concept is computed using an iterative algorithm based on the previous work on statistical image annotation. The learned model is then applied to identify which images are visually relevant to the concept implied by the keyword. Implicitly, which regions or the images are relevant is also determined. Our experiments reveal that the new method performs much better than Google Image Search and a simple method based on more standard content based image retrieval methods."

                "text": "\"Bag of words\" models have enjoyed much attention and achieved good performances in recent studies of object categorization. In most of these works, local patches are modeled as basic building blocks of an image, analogous to words in text documents. In most previous works using the \"bag of words\" models (e.g. [4, 20, 7]), the local patches are assumed to be independent with each other. In this paper, we relax the independence assumption and model explicitly the inter-dependency of the local regions. Similarly to previous work , we represent images as a collection of patches, each of which belongs to a latent \"theme\" that is shared across images as well as categories. We learn the theme distributions and patch distributions over the themes in a hierarchical structure [22]. In particular, we introduce a linkage structure over the latent themes to encode the dependencies of the patches. This structure enforces the semantic connections among the patches by facilitating better clustering of the themes. As a result, our models for object categories tend to be more discriminative than the ones obtained under the independent patch assumption. We show highly competitive categorization results on both the Caltech 4 and Caltech 101 object category datasets. By examining the distributions of the latent themes for each object category, we construct an object taxonomy using the 101 object classes from the Caltech 101 datasets."

Learning the joint distribution of image regions and words has many applications. We consider in detail predicting words associated with whole images (auto-annotation) and corresponding to particular image regions (region naming). Auto-annotation might help organize and access large collections of images. Region naming is a model of object recognition as a process of translating image regions to words, much as one might translate from one language to another. Learning the relationships between image regions and semantic correlates (words) is an interesting example of multi-modal data mining, particularly because it is typically hard to apply data mining techniques to collections of images. We develop a number of models for the joint distribution of image regions and words, including several which explicitly learn the correspondence between regions and words. We study multi-modal and correspondence extensions to Hofmann's hierarchical clustering/aspect model, a translation model adapted from statistical machine translation (Brown et al.), and a multi-modal extension to mixture of latent Dirichlet allocation (MoM-LDA). All models are assessed using a large collection of annotated images of real scenes. We study in depth the difficult problem of measuring performance. For the annotation task, we look at prediction performance on held out data. We present three alternative measures, oriented toward different types of task. Measuring the performance of correspondence methods is harder, because one must determine whether a word has been placed on the right region of an image. We can use annotation performance as a proxy measure, but accurate measurement requires hand labeled data, and thus must occur on a smaller scale. We show results using both an annotation proxy, and manually labeled data."

The images we classify depict animals in a wide range of aspects, configurations and appearances. In addition, the images typically portray multiple species that differ in appearance (e.g. ukari\u2019s, vervet monkeys, spider monkeys, rhesus monkeys, etc.). Our method is accurate despite this variation and relies on four simple cues: text, color, shape and texture. Visual cues are evaluated by a voting method that compares local image phenomena with a number of visual exemplars for the category. The visual exemplars are obtained using a clustering method applied to text on web pages. The only supervision required involves identifying which clusters of exemplars refer to which sense of a term (for example, \"monkey\" can refer to an animal or a bandmember). Because our method is applied to web pages with free text, the word cue is extremely noisy. We show unequivocal evidence that visual information improves performance for our task. Our method allows us to produce large, accurate and challenging visual datasets mostly automatically."

In this paper, we introduce a statistical modeling approach to this problem. Categorized images are used to train a dictionary of hundreds of statistical models each representing a concept. Images of any given concept are regarded as instances of a stochastic process that characterizes the concept. To measure the extent of association between an image and the textual description of a concept, the likelihood of the occurrence of the image based on the characterizing stochastic process is computed. A high likelihood indicates a strong association. In our experimental implementation, we focus on a particular group of stochastic processes, that is, the two-dimensional multiresolution hidden Markov models (2D MHMMs). We implemented and tested our ALIP (Automatic Linguistic Indexing of Pictures) system on a photographic image database of 600 different concepts, each with about 40 training images. The system is evaluated quantitatively using more than 4,600 images outside the training database and compared with a random annotation scheme. Experiments have demonstrated the good accuracy of the system and its high potential in linguistic indexing of photographic images."

We propose a novel framework where individual components are developed to model different relationships between documents and queries and then combined into a joint retrieval framework. In the state-of-the-art systems, a late combination between two independent systems, one analyzing just the text part of such documents, and the other analyzing the visual part without leveraging any knowledge acquired in the text processing, is the norm. Such systems rarely exceed the performance of any single modality (i.e. text or video) in information retrieval tasks. Our experiments indicate that allowing a rich interaction between the modalities results in significant improvement in performance over any single modality. We demonstrate these results using the TRECVID03 corpus, which comprises 120 hours of broadcast news videos. Our results demonstrate over 14 % improvement in IR performance over the best reported text-only baseline and ranks amongst the best results reported on this corpus."

We incorporate statistical natural language processing in order to deal with free text. We demonstrate the current system on a difficult dataset, namely 10000 images of work from the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco. The images include line drawings, paintings, and pictures of sculpture and ceramics. Many of the images have associated free text which varies greatly from physical description to interpretation and mood. We use WordNet to provide semantic grouping information and to help disambiguate word senses, as well as emphasize the hierarchical nature of semantic relationships. This allows us to impose a natural structure on the image collection that reflects semantics to a considerable degree. Our method produces a joint probability distribution for words and picture elements. We demonstrate that this distribution can be used: (a) to provide illustrations for given captions, and (b) to generate words for images outside the training set. Results from this annotation process yield a quantitative study of our method. Finally, the annotation process can be seen as a form of object recognizer that has been learned through a partially supervised process."

Numerous applications in computer vision can be naturally interpreted as instanciations of this fundamental problem. Recently, a non-iterative discrete approach, tensor voting, has been introduced to solve this problem and has been applied successfully to various applications. As an alternative, we propose a variational formulation of this problem in the continuous setting and derive an iterative algorithm which approximates its solutions. This method and tensor voting are somewhat the differential and integral form of one another. Although iterative methods are slower in general, the strength of the suggested method is that it can easily be applied when the ambient space is not Euclidean, which is important in many applications. The algorithm consists in solving a partial differential equation that performs a special anisotropic diffusion on an implicit representation of the known set of points. This results in connecting isolated neighbouring points. This approach is very simple, mathematically sound, robust and powerful since it handles in a homogeneous way manifolds of arbitrary dimension and topology, embedded in Euclidean or non-Euclidean spaces, with or without border. We shall present this approach and demonstrate both its benefits and shortcomings in two different contexts: (i) data visual analysis, (ii) skin detection in color images."

A simple clustering method can produce fair results. We improve these results significantly by combining the clustering process with a model of the probability that an individual is depicted given its context. Once the labeling procedure is over, we have an accurately labeled set of faces, an appearance model for each individual depicted, and a natural language model that can produce accurate results on captions in isolation."

The EMD is based on the minimal cost that must be paid to transform one distribution into the other, in a precise sense, and was first proposed for certain vision problems by Peleg, Werman, and Rom. For image retrieval, we combine this idea with a representation scheme for distributions that is based on vector quantization. This combination leads to an image comparison framework that often accounts for perceptual similarity better than other previously proposed methods. The EMD is based on a solution to the transportation problem from linear optimization, for which efficient algorithms are available, and also allows naturally for partial matching. It is more robust than histogram matching techniques, in that it can operate on variable-length representations of the distributions that avoid quantization and other binning problems typical of histograms. When used to compare distributions with the same overall mass, the EMD is a true metric. In this paper we focus on applications to color and texture, and we compare the retrieval performance of the EMD with that of other distances."

The analysis shows that control scores are predictive of performance of novel algorithms at statistically significant levels. The analysis identified three methodological areas for improvement in automatic face recognition. First, the majority of papers report experimental results for face recognition problems that are already solved. Second, authors do not adequately document their experiments.

People play the game because of its entertainment value, and as a side effect of them playing, we collect valuable image metadata, such as which pixels belong to which object in the image. The collected data could be applied towards constructing more accurate computer vision algorithms, which require massive amounts of training and testing data not currently available. Peekaboom has been played by thousands of people, some of whom have spent over 12 hours a day playing, and thus far has generated millions of data points. In addition to its purely utilitarian aspect, Peekaboom is an example of a new, emerging class of games, which not only bring people together for leisure purposes, but also exist to improve artificial intelligence. Such games appeal to a general audience, while providing answers to problems that computers cannot yet solve."

How can we separate the overall motion (a finite-dimensional group action) from the more general deformation (a diffeomorphism)? In this paper we propose a definition of motion for a deforming object and introduce a notion of \u201cshape average\u201d as the entity that separates the motion from the deformation. Our definition allows us to derive novel and efficient algorithms to register non-identical shapes using region-based methods, and to simultaneously approximate and align structures in greyscale images. We also extend the notion of shape average to that of a \u201cmoving average\u201d in order to track moving and deforming objects through time. The algorithms we propose extend prior work on landmark-based matching to smooth curves, and involve the numerical integration of partial differential equations, which we address within the framework of level set methods."

                "text": "This paper presents a novel statistical method for factor analysis of binary and count data which is closely related to a technique known as Latent Semantic Analysis. In contrast to the latter method which stems from linear algebra and performs a Singular Value Decomposition of co-occurrence tables, the proposed technique uses a generative latent class model to perform a probabilistic mixture decomposition. This results in a more principled approach with a solid foundation in statistical inference. More precisely, we propose to make use of a temperature controlled version of the Expectation Maximization algorithm for model fitting, which has shown excellent performance in practice. Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis has many applications, most prominently in information retrieval, natural language processing, machine learning from text, and in related areas. The paper presents perplexity results for different types of text and linguistic data collections and discusses an application in automated document indexing. The experiments indicate substantial and consistent improvements of the probabilistic method over standard Latent Semantic Analysis."

Such markets pool the information that is known to diverse individuals into a common resource, and have many advantages over standard institutions for information aggregation, such as news media, peer review, trials, and opinion polls. Speculative markets are decentralized and relatively egalitarian, and can offer direct, concise, timely, and precise estimates in answer to questions we pose. In the second section, the author argues that now is the time for computer science and cognitive science to have their big science-one that harvests informal knowledge from a large number of e-citizens for building useful software for next generation systems. Given the conjunction of several forces-the need for natural human-machine interfaces and improved Web searching, the existence of good learning algorithms and Web infrastructure, and the demonstrated success of the Open Source methodology-the time is right for the Open Mind Initiative."
