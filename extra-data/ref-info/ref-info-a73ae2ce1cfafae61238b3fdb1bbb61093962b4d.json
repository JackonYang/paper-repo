The main advantage of these architectures is that they learn an embedding for words (or other symbols) in a continuous space that helps to smooth the language model and provide good generalization even when the number of training examples is insufficient. However, these models are extremely slow in comparison to the more commonly used n-gram models, both for training and recognition. As an alternative to an importance sampling method proposed to speed-up training, we introduce a hierarchical decomposition of the conditional probabilities that yields a speed-up of about 200 both during training and recognition. The hierarchical decomposition is a binary hierarchical clustering constrained by the prior knowledge extracted from the WordNet semantic hierarchy."

This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts."

Recently, new approaches based on factored language models have been developed to address this problem. These models provide principled ways of including additional conditioning variables other than the preceding words, such as morphological or syntactic features. However, the number of possible choices for model parameters creates a large space of models that cannot be searched exhaustively. This paper presents an entirely data-driven model selection procedure based on genetic search, which is shown to outperform both knowledge-based and random selection procedures on two different language modeling tasks (Arabic and Turkish)."

However, it faces the data sparseness problem because of the large dimensionality and diversity of the information available in the syntactic parsing. Previously, we proposed using neural network models for the SLM (Emami, A. et al., Proc. ICASSP, 2003; Emami, Proc. EUROSPEECH'03., 2003). The neural network model is better suited to tackle the data sparseness problem and its use gave significant improvements in perplexity and word error rate over the baseline SLM. We present a new method of training the neural net based SLM. This procedure makes use of the partial parsing hypothesized by the SLM itself, and is more expensive than the approximate training method used previously. Experiments with the new training method on the UPenn and WSJ corpora show significant reductions in perplexity and word error rate, achieving the lowest published results for the given corpora."

Therefore this type of LM is interesting for tasks for which only a very limited amount of in-domain training data is available, such as the modeling of conversational speech. In this paper we analyze the generalization behavior of the neural network LM for in-domain training corpora varying from 7M to over 21M words. In all cases, significant word error reductions were observed compared to a carefully tuned 4-gram backoff language model in a state of the art conversational speech recognizer for the NIST rich transcription evaluations. We also apply ensemble learning methods and discuss their connections with LM interpolation."

The connectionist models use a distributed representation of the items in the history and make much better use of contexts than currently used interpolated or back-off models, not only because of the inherent capability of the connectionist model in fighting the data sparseness problem, but also because of the sublinear growth in the model size when the context length is increased. The connectionist models can be further trained by an EM procedure, similar to the previously used procedure for training the SLM. Our experiments show that the connectionist models can significantly improve the PPL over the interpolated and back-off models on the UPENN Treebank corpora, after interpolating with a baseline trigram language model. The EM training procedure can improve the connectionist models further, by using hidden events obtained by the SLM parser."

In this paper we investigate the use of morphology-based language models at different stages in a speech recognition system for conversational Arabic. Class-based and single-stream factored language models using morphological word representations are applied within an N-best list rescoring framework. In addition, we explore the use of factored language models in first-pass recognition, which is facilitated by two novel procedures: the data-driven optimization of a multi-stream language model structure, and the conversion of a factored language model to a standard word-based model. We evaluate these techniques on a large-vocabulary recognition task and demonstrate that they lead to perplexity and word error rate reductions."

An FLM represents words as bundles of features (e.g., morphological classes, stems, data-driven clusters, etc.), and induces a probability model covering sequences of bundles rather than just words. GPB extends standard backoff to general conditional probability tables where variables might be heterogeneous types, where no obvious natural (temporal) backoff order exists, and where multiple dynamic backoff strategies are allowed. These methodologies were implemented during the JHU 2002 workshop as extensions to the SRI language modeling toolkit. This paper provides initial perplexity results on both CallHome Arabic and on Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal articles. Significantly, FLMs with GPB can produce bigrams with significantly lower perplexity, sometimes lower than highly-optimized baseline trigrams. In a multi-pass speech recognition context, where bigrams are used to create first-pass bigram lattices or N-best lists, these results are highly relevant."

Turkish presents an interesting problem for statistical models as the potential tag set size is very large because of the productive derivational morphology. We propose to handle this by breaking up the morhosyntactic tags into inflectional groups, each of which contains the inflectional features for each (intermediate) derived form. Our statistical models score the probability of each morhosyntactic tag by considering statistics over the individual inflectional groups and surface roots in trigram models. Among the four models that we have developed and tested, the simplest model ignoring the local morphotactics within words performs the best. Our best trigram model performs with 93.95% accuracy on our test data getting all the morhosyntactic and semantic features correct. If we are just interested in syntactically relevant features and ignore a very small set of semantic features, then the accuracy increases to 95.07%."
