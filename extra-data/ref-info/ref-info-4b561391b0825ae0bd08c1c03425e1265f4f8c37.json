At many tasks, such as the solution of systems of linear equations, these machines are thousands of times as fast as human beings. However, they are relatively inept at solving many problems where the data is arranged naturally in a spatial form. For example, when it comes to playing chess or recognizing sophisticated patterns, present day machines cannot match the performance of their designers. The difficulty in such cases appears to be that conventional computers can actively cope with only a small amount of information at any one time. (This circumstance is aptly illustrated by the title of an article by Samuel, \"Computing Bit by Bit.\") It appears that efficient handling of problems of the type mentioned above cannot be accomplished without some form of parallel action. A stored program computer is described which can handle spatial problems by operating directly on information in planar form without scanning or using other techniques for transforming the problem into some other domain. The order structure of this machine is explained and illustrated by a few simple programs. An estimate of the size of the computer (based on one possible design) is given. Programs have been written that enable the machine to recognize alphabetic characters independent of position, proportion, and size."

This processing is done manually in many applications. Thus, such inputs as punched cards, magnetic tape, and punched paper tape often are the result of a manual processing operation in which a human being is required to inspect visually an array of printed characters and to describe these data in a form capable of being processed by machine. In recognition of the importance of automating such operations, many investigations have been undertaken to devise automatic character sensing equipment. Suppose, however, that we attempt to view such efforts in proper perspective. We find a more fundamental problem that has, heretofore, failed to receive the attention that it warrants. The problem is one of making directly available to a computer pictorial information which would ordinarily be visually processed by human beings before being fed to a data processing system. This pictorial information may range from such highly stylized forms as printed characters, diagrams, schematic drawings, emblems, and designs through less stylized forms in cartoons and handwritten characters to such highly amorphous forms as photographs of real objects, e.g., people, aerial views, and microscopic and telescopic images."

This identification is independent of rotation and, within limits, of size, precision of drawing, or positioning. The system will also distinguish and count separate objects up to six with limited independence of the size, shape and position of each object.\n This \"Gestalt\" recognition is accomplished by using a dilating circular scan. The virtue of such scanning is that object-size changes translate into time-of-arrival changes while object rotation preserves topological relationships. The n-gon detection depends on side counting, and the object counter uses the same logic in conjunction with a detection of discontinuities.\n Thirty-two small photocells arrayed in a circle are mechanically puckered across the input plane. Light signals derived from opaque line-drawings are converted into \"binary representation in a special thyratron register. Time sequencing of logical operations and output displays is relay controlled. The actual decision logic uses a novel combination of optical and electronic devices in a simple but effective manner.\n It is also shown that this circular scan technique is applicable to automatic detection of letters and numbers over a wide variety of styles, and several examples are given."

A particular hypothetical machine model for shape recognition is described. Examples are given of recognition of 12 to 20 categories of geometric shapes, by use of a contour-projection principle. Within certain limitations, the model identifies these graphic patterns, regardless of size, location, and certain rotational transformations. It provides means for detecting classes of patterns which would or would not be ambiguous with respect to any of the patterns that are recognizable. Problems in practical application, including possibilities for recognition of constrained handdrawn figures, are considered. Possible means of implementation are also discussed."

These questions are more philosophical than technical and I am going to duck them."
